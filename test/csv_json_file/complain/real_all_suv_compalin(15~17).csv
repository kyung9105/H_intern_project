24,accessories-interior,equipment_adaptive,MT,USA,Aug 05,dodge,durango,2015.0,"2,900 miles","The adaptive cruise control (acc) applies the brakes and brings the vehicle to a stop when following another vehicle in traffic. If the vehicle ahead does not move forward within two seconds (unlikely in heavy traffic) the acc displays a message in the dash warning the driver to press the brake and then suddenly shuts off the acc and releases the brake causing the car to being to creep forward. My car came close to rolling into the car in front because the first time I used the acc I did not expect this behavior. The acc is promoted as having a stop and go feature. I expected the acc to wait until the car I was behind to resume speed and then resume speed for my car accordingly. (this is the way I was used to this feature working in my Mercedes S550). There is a sophisticated center dash computer system showing climate, radio, nav, etc. I was exploring this system and not watching the driver information display in the dash and as such, missed the very brief message warning me to apply the brake. Besides the fact that in essence this car does not really employ a stop and go feature for all practical purposes and lulls a new driver into a false sense of security, the current implementation makes no sense from a safety standpoint. The driver should not have to do anything for the car to resume following the car in front. A less desirable, but better implementation would be to require some driver input to the car to resume travel - but this certainly would not qualify as a stop and go acc.-Bozeman, MT, USA",Durango,2015

My car came close to rolling into the car in front because the first time I used the acc I did not expect this behavior. The acc is promoted as having a stop and go feature. I expected the acc to wait until the car I was behind to resume speed and then resume speed for my car accordingly. (this is the way I was used to this feature working in my Mercedes S550). There is a sophisticated center dash computer system showing climate, radio, nav, etc. I was exploring this system and not watching the driver information display in the dash and as such, missed the very brief message warning me to apply the brake. Besides the fact that in essence this car does not really employ a stop and go feature for all practical purposes and lulls a new driver into a false sense of security, the current implementation makes no sense from a safety standpoint. The driver should not have to do anything for the car to resume following the car in front.

Received E-mailed notification from Landmark Service dept Feb. 16th informing me that the first service check was coming up soon and to call for appointment. I contacted Landmark, Morrow, Ga to see if I could have it serviced at the Local Dodge Dealership in Columbus Ga and the answer was Yes...any Chrysler, RAM, Fiat, Dodge Dealership will be fine.I took the vehicle in for service on March 6, 2015 approx. around noon and picked it up when it was ready that afternoon between 4 & 5pm. My partner (who is also financed on the lease of the car) drove the vehicle to Missouri in tow with three other family members to help pack and relocate ailing grandmother to another state (Texas). The vehicle stalled on N.Belt Hwy in St. Joseph Missouri. The oil light lit up and instantly the car stalled in mid-operation.Once she driver drifted as far as she could off the road, the car began to smoke. She as well as the other passengers began to grab the luggage in fear that the vehicle was going to catch on fire due to the horrific smell. The local fire dept and Police arrived at the scene. I received the frantic call from her and I called Roadside assistance and requested for them to contact her for the location to surrender help. Roadside assistance towed the vehicle to the nearest dealership (Car City Chrysler in St. Joseph Missouri).After a 3 to 4 hour wait for the mechanic to diagnose the problem, the Mechanic specifically explained that when he removed the Drain Mast from underneath the Dodge Dart, the oil plug was detached. The oil plug was sitting right on top and that the person who did the oil change improperly re-installed the oil plug and in all, the oil plug worked itself out completely by it being loose. After I was told the BAD news, I immediately went to the Dodge dealership in Columbus Ga to discuss this issue with them and to see if they could assist in anyway to help my partner and family get back to Columbus Ga since they were stranded with NO transportation AND in an unfamiliar state over 855 miles away!Dodge Dealership offered no assistance and instead is trying to deny their workmanship error. My partner surrendered the cash on hand she had for purchases of two airline tickets for two of the family member passengers because they had to be at work the very next morning. I had to wire funds to my partner in order for her and the sister to rent a vehicle back to Columbus Ga the next day.Carl Gregory Dodge filed a claim on their insurance and I was told from today 3/31/15, there will be another 48 to 72 hrs to wait on an adjustor to visit the dealership in Missouri. In the meantime, I have no transportation and certainly is not prepared to come out of pocket again to spill out money for another rental!! Dodge is questioning the timing of the oil plug falling out. I'm pretty sure the vibration of the long trip help the loose plug detach fully. It would have happened here in Columbus Ga eventually but the car was not driven a long period of time on any one trip. I work 10 to 15 minutes...by the time the engine starts to get hot, I'm shutting it down in the parking lot at my job or at the house after I get off. Running errors here in there on an off day was the same way.Whatever the verdict is with the insurance company, I will never deal with Dodge Dealership again! The value of the car is very much diminished and it is no use for me anymore besides, why would I want to continue dealing with Dodge if there is no trust in their workmanship or support in a situation like this!!!!!

This car is equipped with a rotarty transmission selector for drive by wire transmission and has an auto engine stop start feature. This start stop feature can be disabled after the vehicle is started, but cannot be set by default to disable this feature. I understand the fuel saving issue, however but many of us have been driving for many years and we do a lot of things unconsciously because these activities are so common to us. When this feature is activated and you come into your drive way, your garage or a parking space and fully come to a stop, the engine turns off and all goes quiet. Subconsciously because of a lifetime of driving experience, you think the car is off, your travel is over and you are ready to exit the vehicle. You start to open the door and release the brake pedal and the vehicle immediately restarts and moves forward. If a child or someone else or a building wall is it front of the vehicle, a serious accident could happen. Please rethink this. It is not an intuitive process when we have years or decades of a different driving experience. We think the car is off, safe to exit. We need a way to default disable this feature rather than default enable. I know there is an investigation regarding death or injury with regard to the transmission on these vehicles, specifically a claim that vehicle could move with selector put in the park position. I wonder how many accidents were result of drivers thinking the vehicle was off and then it moved. It may be embarrassing and not be admitted to.-Chandler, AZ, USA",Durango,2016

Dealer couldn't figure it out. We took a new Durango from the lot for a drive and it whistled just like mine. I told the dealer there should be a bulletin on it if two of them both whistled. They found out that it was where the washer fluid hose goes over the weather stripping in front of the fire wall. The fix was to move the hose from the built in clip on the underside of the hood to a new location about two inches down to a round hole in the hood. I think it is a drain hole for between the two layers of the hood. They put a loose or floating clip in there to hold the hose. It fixed the problem unless there was a really strong wind and the there was usually a noise coming from somewhere else anyway. The part that is very stupid is that my 2017 is designed exactly the same wayand has the same whistle..You would think the geniuses at Chrysler would have figured It out by now and had a new design for it.

Was told that it could not be carbon monoxide in cabin making me dizzy and sick feeling because ""catalytic converter changes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, which is why dealer uses CO2 meter not co meter"". was informed that regional engineer instructed dealer to repeat tsb 14-0130 even though they were then telling me that the smell is from ""mildew on the A/C evaporator core"", which contradicts their performing the tsb to seal the vehicle from exhaust fumes a second time (performed previously without effect in 10/2015). Have been told many different ""reasons"" for the fumes in cabin, none of which make much sense. Mildew does not smell like sulfur or exhaust fumes. To make things worse, I was told that I ""do not drive enough miles"" during my trips to ""dry out the evaporator core"" so I am told my driving habits, not Ford's design flaws allowing exhaust into cabin, are the reason for the fumes. Service manager has been diligent and professional and is a genuinely nice person, though Ford is trying to serve up a ""red herring"" by trying to divert attention to the A/C system rather than admit to exhaust fumes in passenger cabin.

In order to go anywhere, we need to back it out of its parking spot, reverse-turn to the right, apply the brakes, put the vehicle in drive, and finally drive forward on the driveway until reaching the street. This morning, my wife planned to go to the store. She entered the vehicle, started it, put it in reverse, and proceeded to back out of the parking spot. As usual, she applied the brakes to stop the car and put it in drive, but unfortunately, this morning the brakes did not respond. She applied the brakes a few more times to no avail. After that did not work, she applied the emergency brake, which did not do anything either. Finally, she turned off the engine and put the car in park, which didn't do anything either. She ended up doing a U-turn in reverse. My other truck was parked to the right of where the Ford Explorer was parked, so once the Ford Explorer reached my parked truck and collided with it, the Ford Explorer finally stopped. In addition to my wife, our two sons aged 6 and 8, were inside the vehicle with her when this happened. We have attached a photo of the Ford Explorer collided onto my parked truck (a Ford F150), which it had to do in order to stop and not collide into anything or anyone else. The main reason we got a Ford Explorer is because we believed it would be a sturdy SUV that would keep my wife and kids safe, so this incident is extremely concerning. The car is almost new with approximately 12,000 miles and we have had already had to take it into the repair shop approximately eight times. We have asked Ford to replace it, but they have not been willing to do so, which is why we are escalating this matter to regulating agencies for resolution as well as out of concern for other families who may have had a similar experience.-Sylmar, CA, USA",Explorer,2016

When I picker up the vehicle my receipt stated ""could not verify problem"", (that is a major cover-up) by the dealer from liability. I filed complaint with Ford and took it to another dealership. They verified the problem and have had it twice more and replaced the exhaust and resealed the body seams but the smell is still there. I have been in contact with Ford but keep getting the run around and told I have to take it back to the dealer but the dealer tells me they have done everything to try and fix it. My main complaint is that this is a lease vehicle so it belongs to Ford, they should just take their vehicle back and release me from my lease since they cannot fix their vehicle. Ford tells me that they filed the paperwork for the lemon law but I need to take it back to the dealer again and again. I just picked it up Saturday and this is Monday and Ford says take it back to the dealer and Ford will call me on Friday.

Currently the odometer reads 2,100 miles and they were not enjoyable miles. I have to say that this 2015 Explorer has the worst design on the inside that I've ever seen. The outward visibility from the driver's seat for the front and rear of this vehicle is severely compromised by the huge C pillars which create blind spots within the vehicle. Although this model has blis, I've almost been in 2 collisions because I cannot see my right side rear or left side rear due to the faulty design of the interior of the vehicle. The blis system did not warn me that there was a tractor trailer approaching me on the left side. This is a problem that the dealer cannot remedy. This is a factory design flaw that is going to get someone seriously injured or killed because the driver can't see what's coming. The blis is useless. Navigating through tight spaces is almost impossible because you cannot see the front end to judge your distance between vehicles/objects and the wide front pillars also add to the frustration of trying to see what's on the side of the vehicle. The blower motor for the heating/ac system just turns off as well as the dashboard cluster lights and then comes back on after 10 - 15 seconds. This has occurred a few times. There is a burning smell inside the vehicle upon start up. Not sure if it's exhaust gas entering the vehicle or if it's something in the heater/ac system. (I was told at the dealership that this is a common problem and will dissipate after a few thousand miles). Not the answer that I wanted to hear. I do not feel safe driving this vehicle.

I called the dealership (river city hyundai) where I got the vehicle from and they say the warranty doesn't cover it as the windshield was not change by them. Team ford dealership in Edmonton said the samething that ford warranty does cover that defect that it would cost me $1009 + tax to have box trim/molding replaced/repaired (they said the windshield was not replaced and trim not put back properly.

Currently the odometer reads 2,100 miles and they were not enjoyable miles. I have to say that this 2015 Explorer has the worst design on the inside that I've ever seen. The outward visibility from the driver's seat for the front and rear of this vehicle is severely compromised by the huge C pillars which create blind spots within the vehicle. Although this model has blis, I've almost been in 2 collisions because I cannot see my right side rear or left side rear due to the faulty design of the interior of the vehicle. The blis system did not warn me that there was a tractor trailer approaching me on the left side. This is a problem that the dealer cannot remedy. This is a factory design flaw that is going to get someone seriously injured or killed because the driver can't see what's coming. The blis is useless. Navigating through tight spaces is almost impossible because you cannot see the front end to judge your distance between vehicles/objects and the wide front pillars also add to the frustration of trying to see what's on the side of the vehicle. The blower motor for the heating/ac system just turns off as well as the dashboard cluster lights and then comes back on after 10 - 15 seconds. This has occurred a few times. There is a burning smell inside the vehicle upon start up. Not sure if it's exhaust gas entering the vehicle or if it's something in the heater/ac system. (I was told at the dealership that this is a common problem and will dissipate after a few thousand miles). Not the answer that I wanted to hear. I do not feel safe driving this vehicle.

There is clearly no customer loyalty from Ford - sadly. This was a problem that occurred when the vehicle was new. I notified the dealership (Marin County Ford) both verbally and eventually asked them to document the problem to ensure that it was noted while under warranty. The dealership checked it out on two occasions and could not fix it. They said they would have to take in the car for an extended period of time and would provide a loaner car. When this appointment arrived, they could not provide me with a loaner car, and therefor I could not leave my vehicle. By the time I was able to get another appointment, my Explorer was just over the 36,000 mile warranty period (like a couple of hundred miles).

Exhaust odor is very strong while going up long grades and hills or if the engine is under a load over 3500 rpm such as accelerating onto the highway. It is even worse if the A/C is on and in re-circulation mode which should not be letting in the outside air. It is so strong that we have to roll the windows down to ventilate and we have had frequent headaches and light headedness while driving from all the fumes. We have had both TSB's completed which still have not solved our issue. On our 1st visit we were told nothing was wrong even though Ford has had a TSB on the issue and known since 2012. The next two times to the dealer, they did the TSB's. On the 4th visit they noted on our work order that odor may occur even with the repairs completed and did nothing else to try to resolve it.

The first occurred when I was on my way to work about 7:30am. I was driving about 60 miles per on hour on a city street and all of a sudden a wrench symbol shows and the car will not accelerate anymore. I had never seen this symbol before so I wasn't sure what was going on and could not find it in the manual. Before this I only could go about 5 miles per hour max speed. When I googled the wrench many others had the same issue. I am sure Ford is aware of this and should had said something about this before we purchased it. I had to end up leaving the Explorer up at Ford for 2 and a half weeks. When I googled the issue it said these Explorer have a faulty throttle body that has to be replaced and my vehicle was no different. Me and my wife shouldn't have to make monthly payments on a brand new vehicle that has a known issue. Secondly, once we hit about 8,000 miles the hood makes a loud buzzing/humming sound once you hit about 60 miles per hour that does not stop!!! many other people with this vehicle have the same problem once I googled this! this is absolutely ridiculous. This vehicle should be recalled and not sold! our entire trip this vehicle made the sound nonstop. A person should not have to hear this the entire time on a brand new vehicle that you make monthly payments on. Something should be done about this. Since Ford does not want to voluntarily issue a recall like they should, an involuntary recall should be issued. When I googled this, it is said that the sound comes from the thin part of the hood in the center that is between two thicker pieces that causes it to vibrate.

After a few short minutes of driving we would have the same exhaust smell on all of our clothing. In addition there were plumes of black smoke coming out of the exhaust every time I accelerated from a stop. Although the two items may not be linked, the fact we are experiencing this at less than 5K miles is more than unsettling, not to mention a possible exposure to carbon monoxide. I fear for the health of my family and any other families where this situation is occurring. Ford is clueless, and currently is offering no means of testing the cabin for exhaust emissions.

I have read complaints about weak sidewalls regarding these tires as early as 2013. Additionally, hankook and Hyundai have issued a recall for these tires (albeit a different size) due to sidewall problems.

Vehicle is equipped with Hankook Ventus S1 Noble 2 tires size 255/50 R20. Shortly after backing out of the driveway and while driving out of our subdivision at approximately 25 mph the warning chime started sounding. Dash display indicated low tire pressure in the passenger side front tire. Display started at about 25psi but quickly fell. Before we could turn around and return to the house, 200 yards, the tire was completely flat. After removal we found that the inside sidewall had ""blown out"". Since it was the weekend I decided to use the time to do some research on Hankooks. (I have a 2015 Genesis and my Genesis dealer told me Hyundai had switched to Michelin for the Genesis due to ""many complaints"" about the Hankooks.) I was surprised and disappointed to find Hankook had issued a recall in January 2016 for this same model time, but not in the size used on the 2106 Explorer. The recall was for inside sidewall failures, the exact problem we suffered. Om Monday I went to my local Ford dealer, explained the problem as well as my research and requested that Ford replace all 4 tires with Michelin Premiere LTX. I told them I had no faith in the safety of the Hankooks. The service manager agreed to submit my request to Ford. The next day I opened a problem case with the Ford customer center as the service manager had informed me he was have trouble getting Ford to respond to the case. While the service manager kept me updated on his discussions with Ford and Hankook, I decided to stop in on Friday afternoon for a face-to-face update. The service manager informed me that Hankook came back with an offer to provide a 40% discount for the purchase of a new tire. The service manager said he had not contacted me about Hankook's offer as it was unsatisfactory to him and he knew it would be unsatisfactory to me. I re-contacted Ford customer service and escalated the issue to a manager after the customer service rep told me Ford has to stand behind their supplier's decision. Of course this means Ford does not really stand behind their product. I am quite disappointed that Ford would install these tires on the Explorer. While I am not a tire engineer, from my research it appears this tire does fine on lighter weight vehicles, but on heavier vehicles such as the Genesis and Explorer the thin sidewalls are a problem. I am especially disappointed that Ford would install this tire on a vehicle that was ordered with a tow package. Needless to say, these tires are going to be replaced one way or another and I will never buy another Hankook. I also suggest anyone buying an Explorer require the dealer replace the Hankooks.",Explorer Limited 3.5L,2017

My legs started to get compressed by the steering wheel, while at the same time my knees were being forced into the plastic pieces under the steering column. My body was being forced against the steering wheel. I tried to stop the seat from moving by using my body to create a force but the seat would not stop. When the seat finally stopped, my legs were in pain and I could barely breathe from the steering wheel being against my chest. I panicked and didn't know what to do.

If my husband were the one to press the button while he was sitting in the drivers seat, he would have broken bones. My rental provider never showed us the features of the vehicle, nor were there any written warning labels in clear sight on the inside of the vehicle. My husband informed me after the incident that the numbered buttons on the door are a memory function for the seat. It is now a strong fear of mine that if I were driving this vehicle, and I accidentally pressed this button (thinking I pressed the lock control),that I would be in a car accident. The design of this memory function is flawed and needs to be corrected immediately before someone gets severely injured or killed. I am also fearful that the rental company will rent this vehicle to someone else, because a larger person than myself, will undoubtedly be injured or killed.

The first occurred when I was on my way to work about 7:30am. I was driving about 60 miles per on hour on a city street and all of a sudden a wrench symbol shows and the car will not accelerate anymore. I had never seen this symbol before so I wasn't sure what was going on and could not find it in the manual. Before this I only could go about 5 miles per hour max speed. When I googled the wrench many others had the same issue. I am sure Ford is aware of this and should had said something about this before we purchased it. I had to end up leaving the Explorer up at Ford for 2 and a half weeks. When I googled the issue it said these Explorer have a faulty throttle body that has to be replaced and my vehicle was no different. Me and my wife shouldn't have to make monthly payments on a brand new vehicle that has a known issue. Secondly, once we hit about 8,000 miles the hood makes a loud buzzing/humming sound once you hit about 60 miles per hour that does not stop!!! many other people with this vehicle have the same problem once I googled this! this is absolutely ridiculous. This vehicle should be recalled and not sold! our entire trip this vehicle made the sound nonstop. A person should not have to hear this the entire time on a brand new vehicle that you make monthly payments on. Something should be done about this. Since Ford does not want to voluntarily issue a recall like they should, an involuntary recall should be issued.

I dropped off my suv at the dealership, Maxwell Ford in Austin as I have done countless times before, to have a creaking and knocking noise looked at and hopefully repaired this time. After driving around with my service advisor and the front-end vehicle specialist for a half hour we located the area of the exact noise was coming from. That was on a Thursday (2-09-17) and after waiting a few days I decided to call the body shop, as that's what service informed me of where it was going to be repaired the day after it was dropped off, only to find out they could not or will not fix the problem and it was kicked back to service. The body shop explained they could not fix the issue as it had to do with the welded portion of the center pillar under the vehicle and any fix would compromise the integrity of the structure of the vehicle. I am limbo at this point as I await to see what the next steps are. If it is a structural issue that cannot be fixed due to the fact it might inhibit the airbags from deploying in a car accident, they why is this not considered a defect and why does it not qualify for the ""Ford Buy-Back Program?"" The body shop stated it will not cut into the frame to fix ""a noise issue"" as it is not worth it, now I get that but this is a brand new car (or at least it was when I signed my lease)and it should not have the issues it has been having. There have been countless other problems with this vehicle on top of this most recent one. It makes me sad to think that I'm stuck with a noisy racket of ash*ttyvehicle for however long I have left on my lease.

When vehicle was ready for pick up we noticed that the driver side middle row seat material was pulled away from the foam cushion. The selling dealer said they would put a warranty claim into Ford to get the seat fixed. We received a call from dealer a few weeks later and said Ford would fix the seat and take the vehicle to a dealer closer to our area to have it fixed under warranty. We took the vehicle to the dealer and the warranty person there would not even come out and look at it since we did not buy it there. I called the Ford cs line and made a complaint. They called the dealer and asked them to look at the seat. We took the vehicle back to them and they took pictures and sent to Ford for warranty approval. We received a call from cs and they said the pictures did not show any damage and no repairs would be made. I asked the cs person if I could send my pictures of the seat and they said ok. I sent pictures of the seat damage and Ford went back and forth with me and even got a warranty rep involved. The bottom line is that the seat cushion is pulled away from the foam and it is damaged, Ford did get back with me and said it is not damaged and they will not cover under warranty. My advice to anyone thinking about buying a Ford product especially an Explorer is not to. Apparently quality control is not one of their main points.

The seat moved up and forward, while the steering wheel moved down. My legs started to get compressed by the steering wheel, while at the same time my knees were being forced into the plastic pieces under the steering column. My body was being forced against the steering wheel. I tried to stop the seat from moving by using my body to create a force but the seat would not stop. When the seat finally stopped, my legs were in pain and I could barely breathe from the steering wheel being against my chest. I panicked and didn't know what to do. My husband had to open the drivers side door and use the controls to get me free. I was afraid for my life, I could've been severely injured. If my husband were the one to press the button while he was sitting in the drivers seat, he would have broken bones. My rental provider never showed us the features of the vehicle, nor were there any written warning labels in clear sight on the inside of the vehicle. My husband informed me after the incident that the numbered buttons on the door are a memory function for the seat. It is now a strong fear of mine that if I were driving this vehicle, and I accidentally pressed this button (thinking I pressed the lock control),that I would be in a car accident. The design of this memory function is flawed and needs to be corrected immediately before someone gets severely injured or killed. I am also fearful that the rental company will rent this vehicle to someone else, because a larger person than myself, will undoubtedly be injured or killed. Whether this is a factory preset or a function that had been programmed by a previous renter or the rental company, I am unaware, but it needs to be addressed.-East Chatham, NY, USA",Explorer,2015

The check engine light stayed on but I was able to pull back onto the road at full speed. Approximately 1/4 mile down the road I stopped at a traffic light. Once again, I began to cross the intersection when the accelerator stopped working and the dashboard lit up. I pulled over and reset the car as I had done before and proceeded to drive away. A few hundred feet away, the accelerator stopped working again and the dashboard lit up. I was able to pull over, reset the car and drive away. This is an extremely dangerous condition that needs to be fixed immediately. The accelerator stops working without warning and the car only travels at a very slow speed that is not controlled by the accelerator. 3 out of 4 times it happened in the middle of an intersection.

I talked to the finance manager and he said he was in the process of backing out a deal because of this very same problem and when asked if they couldn't fix it what would happen? I was told they'd have to get us into something else. The fix was to re-calibrated the recycle switch to turn off upon heavy acceleration. The problem is we live in Arizona, to use max ac, the recycle feature has to be on. Took vehicle back to dealership for this problem and other items needing fixed. Was informed by dealership service writer, he had contacted Ford tech, currently there's no fix for the known problem. Purchased a co tester. Accelerating (65 to 75mph) up steep inclines and on some lower inclines at higher speed and passing, tested with meter and had readings from 29ppm to 112ppm. At times staying at 34ppm.

I took it to Florida recently and it had about 25K miles on it. It stalled and died a few times in Florida the day before I was planning on driving back to Oklahoma. I had the car towed to a dealership that couldn't find the problem. They did inform me that my Explorer had already had the Throttle Body replaced back in Feb 2016. Then last month my car stalled but this time I received ""System Off to Save Battery"". I took the car in, and come to find out my battery was about dead. The dealership replaced the battery and check the alternator. I'm hopeful this has fixed the problem. Yesterday (7/6/17) my car, stalls again, and I receive the ""System Off to Save Battery"" message. II got the car started and since I was by an Autozone, I pulled in there and had them check the battery. I suspected maybe the alternator, and my new battery was already drained. This was NOT the case. The battery and alternator check out good. So I take my car to the dealership, and they put me in a rental. Time will tell. Hopefully they find the problem but because it isn't storing a code, the dealership is having trouble believing it is the Throttle Body since it was just replaced 5 months ago. I'll keep you posted. I really want this to be fixed because I really love my Explorer. I just need it to not die in the middle of the road. I've been lucky, but I can image if it happened merging into traffic.Update from Jul 18, 2017:One week ago Ford called and said my car is fixed, and we have replaced the Throttle Body.  (Note:  This is the second Throttle Body to be replaced.)  I was very happy and optimistic.  I pick the car up, begin to drive it home, and within 10 miles of the shop, it died again.  Seriously!  So it goes back to the shop.  They test and drive it for another few days and send me home saying they can't recreate the problem.  Now in my mind, I'm thinking maybe they just don't believe me that it is dying.    So I take it home and the next day it dies twice, and the day after that it dies twice.  I was able to film with my iPhone those stalls 3 of the 4 times.  Now I have proof that I'm going to be able to take back to the dealership.  Yesterday I met with the dealership service and showed the videos and they said they always believed me, but they just couldn't replicate the issue and it wasn't saving any codes.  They promised they would find it, and believed it was electrical in Nature.  RESULT -->  I received a call stating they fixed my car and that it was a pin failure in the fuse box.  Fuse #33 for PTC and they were 100% certain because every time you even touched the fuse, the engine would stall.  Moral of the story, wiggle your fuses first to see if it might be something simple.

We're picking up the car today and I'm hoping never to have the problem again, however, I'm not sure I'm going to feel completely safe in this car. I am taking this problem a step further by writing to Ford headquarters and to the United States Office of Consumer Affairs (I believe is authority over them) to document this serious issue. I also recommend you do the same if it's happened to you. Thank you for this site. It's very informative.",Explorer V6,2016

I pull in and seem to have all power - the RPMs were jumping all over. Scared half to death I called my husband. Turned vehicle fully off, waited a minute turned it on and the same BIG WRENCH read my manual sign. Again turn it off, open gas door in case of a vapor lock. Wait a few minutes and try again.

I'm not going on a main highway so I get to the first exit and head for the back roads - Good darn thing I did. 5 minutes later the exact same deceleration happens with no gas pedal or speed.

With the weight of the car being the only reason why I was still moving forward, I looked at the instrument panel, and observed a giant orange wrench with the words, ""See Owners Manual"".Luckily, I was almost out in the sticks and was able to coast onto a side road and come to a stop. The engine was still running, the electronics continued to function, yet, I did notice that the tachometer was indicating RPMs which looked like the car was having a seizure. After letting off of the brake pedal, the car inched forward normally, as is the case with all cars equipped with automatic transmissions.Because the display panel told me to, I opened my owners manual and attempted to locate information about this problem. Do not bother opening the owner's manual. There's nothing there for you.I turned off the engine and turned it back on. Nothing changed. I turned off the engine again. I lit up a cigarette, systematically went down the entire list of the 4-letter words I learned from the Army, and finished smoking. Then, I turned the engine back on again, and to my surprise, the accelerator functioned normally. It takes me about 2 minutes to fully smoke a cigarette.I then stopped what I was doing, and drove the car straight to the dealership where we had bought it. They were ""kind enough"" to drive me home. I say this, because even though Ford had screwed me royally, I was still at their mercy, and not vise versa. Unfortunately, however, Ford did not decide to grace me with a temporary replacement vehicle, despite the fact that they had an entire lot full of vehicles, just sitting there.This is when I learned that these Ford mechanics don't work on Fridays. Everyone else on the planet does. But not them. Seemingly, Ford has chosen to smile upon them, and frown upon me. And so, our 2016 Ford Explorer will have sat in the parking spot where I left it for 3 1/2 days, before it is . . . explored.We thought that as the car is sitting there, ashamed and lonely, this would be a great time to assess its value. To our dismay, after paying $42,000 of our hard-earned savings, now the car is worth roughly $24,000. This means that getting rid of this car, would be the equivalent of cheerfully walking into the Ford dealership, writing them a check for $18,000, for nothing, and then leaving.We have decided that this is the ""best"" option, when considering that the alternative option, is the likelihood of dying in this car. Given that Ford is very well aware of this problem and has not issued a safety recall, I can only surmise that our deaths in a 2016 Ford Explorer is what it would take to convince them that a recall is necessary. (Editorial note: It won't be me or my family)If you know anyone who owns a 2016 Ford Explorer, the best thing in the world that you can do for them, is to pour sugar into their gas tank.

We arrived at the hotel safely. the next morning on our way to the family gathering it happened again. luckily I was able to park the SUV. called the service tech from the dealer and explained the issue and without hesitation the service tech answered you must replace the throttle body. He even instructed me to drive up to the nearest Ford Dealer and they would change it immediately. however in VA and on a weekend that's not gonna happen.I called ford road side assistance and was told that the tow truck will arrive around 3pm. I guess the tow truck drivers watch was not set for DST because he came at 4pm and told me that he had just received the call 10 minutes ago. He also had the audacity to tell me that i'm not the only customer around and was hurrying to tow my SUV. now my SUV is in VA and I'm back in PA.Ford can not ship or tow my SUV from one dealer site to another. according to the roadside service I have to pay $460+ to have it towed. McCafferty Ford at Langhorne PA refuses to pay for the towing instead they want me to drive 3 and half hour to Battlefield Ford at Manassas VA to get my SUV. I spoke with Phil the Manager in Langhorne that if they stand behind their product and workmanship they should be able to drive my vehicle down from Manassas VA to Langhorne PA with no problem. again he refused to have my car be driven by one of his drivers. Now I have no car and no rental due to the fact that Phil was waiting for ford to get back to him.I thought he worked for McCafferty Ford? to say that I am frustrated with Ford is an understatement. My SUV is still in Battlefield Ford Manassas VA. I don't think i'm ever going to see it again.,Explorer XLT 3.5L V6,2016

Driving on interstate highway with ""passing lane"" traffic (about 75mph). Running ac at about 70? inside, with all windows up. Panoramic sunroof closed, with inner soft sunshade also closed. About three hours into five hour drive. Suddenly, without any visual warning (e.g., rock, shard), we hear an *explosion* sound from above, along with the sound of glass clanging everywhere and the rush of highway air. I quickly switch my hazards on, decelerate, and pull off the road as quickly as I can. I noticed that no neighboring vehicles as much as flinched during the incident, nor did anyone stop... as if nothing appeared to have happened externally from their point of view. When we got out to investigate, we saw that the front major pane of the panoramic sunroof had completely shattered center-out, probably about 2sqft of glass missing. Notably, several edges around the newly-formed hole were upturned. Those are all the details I can remember. My very strong belief is that the sunroof exploded without any external debris involved. The position of the cartop carrier relative to the hole, my vehicle's position relative to other cars/trucks (not terribly close), the fact that I saw no object hurtling toward the vehicle prior to the incident, the fact that no object was found in between the roof and the inner sunshade, the fact that no other cars/trucks behind me reacted... all the signs point to something simply being wrong with the vehicle.-Chicago, IL, USA",Sorento,2015

I went to turn it on the 4th morning and a cloud of white smoke came out of my tailpipe. I decided it needed to go to Kia immediately. My sorrento is a 2015 with 27xxx miles on it. This is not what I expected from a new car. I brought it to Kia and was called 10 minutes after I received my courtesy ride back. I was told a diagnosis was sludge and they needed maintenence records. I brought my receipts (which I had to have my mechanic type back out as I hadn't saved any reciepts). When we brought those in I had a spare key to my car and noticed it was in the parking lot. I checked under the hood only to discover they hadn't even pulled the valve cover on the car (I know this because there was a dead wasp frozen to the top of the bolt you need to take off to remove the cover that was there when I brought it in). They informed me that they opened the cap and that's how they knew even though initially on the phone they said they pulled the valve cover. They took my service papers and called me the next day to say Kia won't cover it and rejected my records. My mechanic is a licensed mechanic. No reason given for the rejection. They say we will be responsible for engine replacement but still can't give us a diagnosis other than ""sludge"". so much for their ""best warranty in the business"".-Cape Coral, FL, USA",Sorento,2016

Fast forward to April 2016. I got an oil change as I normally do within every 5,000 miles as required with the warranty. A couple days after the oil change the car started making very strange sounds and the oil can light flickering (which based on the manual states ""low oil pressure""). I brought the vehicle back to the Mobil 1 who completed my oil change a couple days prior and explained the issue. They stated ""sometimes with these new cars the computers don't register when the oil is full"", he proceeded to add half a quart of oil and told me I should be fine. This sounding odd to me I called Kia to bring my car in for an inspect and to replace my coolant hose because there was a puncture in it.I bring it in and they fix the hose along with doing an inspection. I told them exactly what the problem was and what the car was doing. The next day they called to tell me they inspected the car and found no issues (I have the inspection paper stating this) and they replaced the hose. I had to pay for the hose because the puncture was caused by an animal and the warranty doesn't cover that.I leave the dealership thinking my car is in good working condition as the dealership told me.
Fast forward 1.5 months...now we are into June. I am driving my family to the movies and I hear the strange sound again when I get to 40 mph and the oil light flickers. Its Friday at around 10 pm which means the dealership is obviously closed but I was ready to call them again in the morning.As I am driving home and going up a bridge my car justsh*tsoff when I am half way up. I begin rolling down the bridge BACKWARDS into oncoming traffic. Luckily it was late so the roads were not packed but there 5-6 vehicles who were coming up the bridge were able to maneuver around my vehicle avoiding a collision.I am then on the side of the road and call AAA. They get my car on the flatbed and he brings me to the SAME dealership I purchased the vehicle at my request. We leave the Car there and I write them a note regarding the issue that took place AGAIN.They call me and say they will look into it. 5 days later they tell me my car is back running and ready for me to pick up. I asked them what the issue was and he said ""The Starter...and we replaced it for you"". I'm not a mechanic but I am also NOT an idiot! A Starter WILL NOT cause you to LOSE POWER AND GO BACKWARDS DOWN A BRIDGE!! I told them that was acceptable and I would not be picking up a hazardous vehicle and putting my family's lives at risk. He says ""oh let me call you back"".Two days later calls me back to say there is something wrong with the engine and they need me to authorize them to ""tear it down for $135""....I authorize because I figured the warranty would cover it once they discovered what the issue was.They told me they found ""sludge"" in my engine and the ""correct filter"" was not used which caused damage to the engine. They said it was Mobil 1's fault and the warranty would not cover the damages. After I told them I was told I could get oil changes anywhere and the manual does not a specific filter that must be used. They told me they need to have my oil change receipts. So I go digging for the receipts over the past year and a half. I go to Mobil 1 and have them reprint my last two most recent ones and I searched for more since I know I got them at least every 5.000 miles. They send in the claim with the two receipts and the claim gets denied due to ""not enough receipts"". 
I find two more and send them to them. At this point they have receipts for at least every 5,000 miles (which is required by the warranty apparently). So now I am waiting for a response from corporate on the final verdict with the additional receipts. 
Oh...and to tell you how terrible and unethical the people at Napleton Kia off Northlake Blvd in Riveria Beach are... when the service manager tells me the warranty claim got denied I asked him what I should do. He says ""you should sell it to another dealership or private sell it since its running and let it be their problem"" WOW! Probably what those jerks did to me!

This is my fourth Kia Sorento, I have owned a 2005, 2011, 2015 and now a 2016. I have a had great luck with them and since I like my wife's 2015 I decided to trade in my car and get another one. Every since I purchased it the steering wheel has been slightly off to the right which drives me crazy!!!! I am a visual person so I decided to take it to the dealer and have an alignment done on it (Approximately 1,700 miles). The four wheel alignment confirmed that the alignment was off, but the steering wheel was still of center. The service adviser informed me it was because of the road crowns which I know is not true. I drove the vehicle for several hundred miles after the alignment and the problem is still there (I just wanted to make sure it is the vehicle and not me getting adjusted to it since I drove a sports sedan prior to this Sorento). I have been in the automotive industry for several years and I work for a tire company now so I know a little bit about automotive repairs. After doing some research it appears that the steering wheel angle sensor needs calibrated, but the dealership doesn't even have an alignment machine so they sent my Sorento to a Chevy Dealership. I called the Kia ""Customer Care"" line and spoke to a man that did have an answer to my questions and kept saying that he would get back to me. I am not one to post online complaints, but this is getting silly and unprofessional. All I want is to drive my car without having problems and fighting the steering wheel while I am driving. The dealership seems to worried about filing a claim with Kia than fixing the problem.Update from Apr 20, 2016:I contacted Kia concerning my steering issue.  My 2016 Kia Sorento was taken into the shop one more time and they fixed the problem by removing the steering wheel and adjusting it to the left by one notch.

Car going for dealer diagnosis today..Here is the issue: with cruise control for example set at 62 MPH engine RPM is like 1975 RPM and coasting down a hill -- all of a sudden you notice the car picking up speed because it's going down a decline or a hill -- the engine RPM becomes erratic with the needle hitting 1000 RPM and then to 3000 RPM and then back down to 2500 RPM and as your coasting down the hill you can feel the auto controls slowing the car down trying to keep the speed at 62 miles per hour but as you look at the RPM again you are now descending at a steady 5000 RPM and you still notice the system trying to do the braking as your traveling down the hill.Something wrong here -- This is so not normal and I don't want to blow the engine. This doesn't even happy on both my Fords (Escape and F150).. On a flat surface or going up a hill the cruise control seems to be performing just fine. I now have around 5600 miles on the vehicle and wanted to do a couple more tests. The two other tests going down a hill produced the same results when using modes ""ECO, Normal and or Sport and then engine light comes on and the oil light came on and I checked the oil and still full but the oil light came on every time I came to a stop and the engine sounded like it wanted to quit then engine started knocking.

This is our second Kia Sorento since October 2014. Wife has one and now I have one. We both love our Kia's. My 2016 Kia with 100 miles has a cruise control problem. Car going for dealer diagnosis this Saturday May 23, 2015.Here is the issue: with cruise control for example set at 62 MPH engine RPM is like 1975 RPM and coasting down a hill -- all of a sudden you notice the car picking up speed because it's going down a decline or a hill -- the engine RPM becomes erratic with the needle hitting 1000 RPM and then to 3000 RPM and then back down to 2500 RPM and as your coasting down the hill you can feel the auto controls slowing the car down trying to keep the speed at 62 miles per hour but as you look at the RPM again you are now descending at a steady 5000 RPM and you still notice the system trying to do the braking as your traveling down the hill.Something wrong here -- I don't want to blow the engine. On a flat surface or going up a hill the cruise control seems to be performing just fine. I now have around 400 miles on the vehicle and wanted to do a couple more tests. The two other tests going down a hill produced the same results. I was informed by dealer to refrain from using the cruise control today and hopefully the car will be fixed this Saturday on 05/23/2015. We both love our new cars and I'm confidant this minor glitch will get fixed under warranty.Update from Jul 7, 2015:After taking the 2016 Kia Sorento back to the service department we went out on a trip with a Kia certified specialist technician . We proceeded up Chesterfield hill Route 9 from Keene NH towards Brattleboro VT. With cruise control on, we started the uphill climb with the engine speed around 3500 RPM and up from 1650 RPM. I can see why the RPM is elevated -- we are climbing about 60 miles per hour in a lower gear -- down from 6th speed gear. Upon reaching the summit and the car finally leveling off  we start another decent downwards and the grade couldn't of been more than 4 or 5 percent and the engine RPM hits 5000 RPM for the entire downward decent for about 45 seconds. Red line is 6500 RPM and the car isn't even broken in. The Special trained factory Kia Sorento technician said this isn't right but he understands the problem. He says that Kia switched the on-board  ECM computer logic software to enable the engine to do all the breaking rather than the transmission to hold back this 3500 pound Kia Sorento. So my thought is now blow the engine and not the transmission. So in the nutshell Kia is letting the engine do the breaking rather than the transmission just like in the trucking industry. We then headed back to the dealership and I demanded they get a hold of corporate Kia service department to give me a letter in writing of some explanation. The answer back from Kia was under no circumstances are you to use cruise control upon approaching or descending an incline or decline greater than 6 degrees. The interstates are full of ups and downs so they basically don't want us to use cruise control here in the Green Mountains of Vermont or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The tech also said that one of the major reasons for this switch is to save on fuel.
I must not understand something or am just ignorant. How can one save on fuel when the engine RPM speed is racing out of control at 5000 RPM and I assume you must be in 1st or 2nd gear to cause the RPM's to spike.
The Kia tech finally admitted that Kia will most likely change the ECM computer logic board programming. This was just his thought and or opinion. The tech said he would reprogram the 2016 Kia Sorento back to original factory specifications and let the vehicle start my driving habits again. So as of that last dealer visit I just don't use my cruise control very much. I want this vehicle to last since I'm now retired and don't want to blow the engine or transmission.Update from May 31, 2016:To the individual, Chris M. who sent me an email asking if I am still having the same problem as to erratic cruise control. I now have around 22,000 miles on my Kia Sorento and the problem was never fixed and I am still having the same problem. So here is my answer. I still use cruise control all the time and when I am ready to approach a decline I turn cruise control off traveling down or up a hill and then resuming cruise control.",Sorento LX 2.4L,2015

Within two weeks, and less than 500 miles, there was a buzzing sound on start up that lasted for 5 minutes or so. It was very cold out so I thought it may be related to that. The problem continued so I called the dealer where I leased the vehicle (785 miles on it at this point). They said to bring it in. It is more than 50 miles from where I live to them. There is another dealer within two miles, they said I could take it there, March 20, 2017. I was at 1,005 miles at this point because I had to travel for business over the weekend. The dealer I took it to took two days to diagnose the problem. The oil pump failed and the engine was full of metal pieces. The fix, replace the engine. This is the fourth KIA I have owned and it may be the last. I have contacted KIA customer support and they were not much help. I suggested that because it has been less than 30 days and the problem started around 500 miles they should replace the vehicle. At trade in time having a remanufactured engine, whether it is good or not, will greatly affect the trade in value. I should not have to suffer financially because of their faulty product.

But I thought oh its a new car and I was not use to it. However my reality came true on Aug. 5, the car stalled and would not crank. Returned to dealer and told it was fixed. And was told there was a recall on the car but after talking to customer care ford the car has no recalls. I even asked the salesman if there were recall on it. Then I happened again. 
Stalled for a second time a Brand new car . I told the dealer I wanted a new car and did not want this one back. The GM is now involved. I told them you can fix the car all you want. It is not dependable anymore. I am going to get a new car and change the law in the process. If u purchase a new car and it stops within 6 months you should be given a new car. If the problem is not your fault. 
So the dealership is trying to fix it for the second time. However, I have call the corporate office hopefully I will get a new car or my money back. This has now become a safety issue. The people at the dealership clearly cannot fix it. But because of arbitration they have to be given a chance to fix it. This needs to be changed. Customers don't need to feel like they have to sign the arbitration agreement. 
How many time do I have to let them try to fix it? Can I sue Ford Motor Company? If they buy the car back I will not get the full price. That should not even be a option. Give the customer a full refund the car stopped/stalled. And I still have to keep paying the payments while they are fixing it. I was given a loaner car. I am expecting a call for corporate on Monday. Also, I can thinking about setting up a petition page on change.org. So I can get the ball rolling on changing the law.Update from Aug 21, 2016:The dealership has replace the throttle body the first time and the ECU the second time.

1054,engine,died_while_driving,KY,USA,Nov 03,ford,edge,2015.0,"Automatic transmission-7,000 miles","I purchased new 2015 Edge September, 2015. Immediately, upon starting in garage, i would start to put in reverse and it wasn't started. So I would have to restart it. Being new to this keyless start, I assumed I just didn't do something properly, but a wrench symbol would show up until I restarted it. Then, about a month ago, I was pulling up to stop on our Lane. The car lost power. It showed ""full power accessory on"". I had to put car in park and restart. Now, again, just last week, November 28th, I was driving down our lane with my son in car, and it lost power again. Luckily no one was behind us. Radio was still on. But nothing happened when I pushed gas pedal. Again, I had to put in park and restart. Same warning came up after it happened ""full power accessory on"". This time we called Dealer. Initially they said they couldn't get to it until the following Tuesday. We told them I wasn't driving this death trap, nor putting my family in it and demanded they provide us rental until they could get it in. After reading the numerous complaints on here, I learned that it was the throttle body and that many were having problems getting it diagnosed, fixed. And even if they were fortunate to have them put a throttle body on, it didn't fix problem. They provided a rental. I wouldn't drive the 55 miles to pick up rental so my husband did. Then amazingly although they initially couldn't get it in until the following Tuesday, they got to it the next day. They drove it. Nothing happened. They put it on machine but no codes showed up. But they got permission because it sounded like a bad throttle body, to put new one on. Then I had to go pick death trap up. I talked with Owner, who said they replaced the part even though it didn't do it for them. I said for them to keep it a month, put their family in it and see if it would do it. I told them that everything I read said this wouldn't fix it because 1) they are either replacing faulty parts with faulty parts, or 2) They don't really know what the problem is although the same problem happened with various models of theirs from 08-13. And all they did then was increase warranty to 150,000 miles. The National Car Commission was pushing for them to recall but kinda left everyone out in cold. I was then told that since they didn't anticipate this problem with future fords- they didn't put codes in for it. Well how convenient is that? And why would you not anticipate it when you never really resolved the problem with the 08-13 various models. Bottom line, they offered to give me what I owe on it toward a trade with them after reminding me that I was angry with Ford, not them, and I would be getting survey to fill out about them. I look around and tell Owner, he is a Ford dealership. He feeds his family by selling their deadly vehicles. How anyone can sleep at night knowing that, I haven't a clue. I would rather work at a 5 Star selling gas, etc for less money and be able to sleep at night. Anyway, we don't want another Ford. We took our car to another lot and they offered us more than what we owe. Going to start an arbitration I guess. Who knows when this will happen again. I may be on interstate next time driving 70 with Semis on my tail. Until we trade, however, I am going to get a clear sign screen printed to put on back windshield warning drivers that my car dies at any speed without warning, leaving me dead in road so please, for their safety and ours, don't follow too closely because the manufacturer doesn't know, nor care, yet again with this problem they have had in numerous other vehicles in past. I've learned a lot about Ford though. They had huge lawsuit where they had to pay 18 billion and then turn around and borrow 15 billion to get out of. They apparently don't care. Apparently someone has to die before they will do the right thing. We aren't going to be their statistics.Update from Feb 21, 2017:UPDATE:  Traded death trap.  Feel so much more comfortable now.  I wasn't going to go through Fords arbitration process with my family at risk.  After all, they said they couldn't detect problem but replaced part that was supposed to ""fix it"".  Through with Fords.  Such a shame too because otherwise I loved this Edge and my previous '08 Edge that I had no problems with.  It's because of that 08 Edge that I wanted another.

I've had it at the dealers on 4 separate occassions where all they tell me is that no code is being thrown. I finally got fed up with it last Friday when it started happening again. I finally got ahold of the GM at the dealership and expressed my frustration over the lack of getting this fixed, especially since this site came up in a search in like 2 seconds.

The latch that holds the blade on to the driver side wiper was blocking the passenger side blade and caused the wipers to become non functional.

The wipers did try to ""fix"" them selves by pulsing a few times but only in the down direction, had they tried to go in the upright direction I think they could have fixed them selves.

I was furious but didn't say anything ,I guess when your brand new car breaks down you should be overjoyed that Ford can take the time to make the effort to fix your car! no one from Ford Company headquarters actually worked to fix this problem aside from a few phone calls ,the mechanics are only as good as the team that backs them up! 
This is day 22 still no car, and headquarters which we have always had to call, they are not good about returning phone calls ,informed us today they will not get us a rental so I can drive my daughter to Chicago to return to college, So we are basically on our own, NO BIG SURPRISE THERE WE HAVE BEEN ON OUR OWN 22 DAYS, 2 CAR PAYMENTS AND FULL COVER INSURANCE ON A PIECE OF SH-T CAR THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED IT CANNOT EVEN REPAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Today Sarah/ Sally told my husband we do not qualify for a replacement, she said we have consumer options. Although no one there can fix this piece of SH_T car we are left to wait ,wait,wait,wait.My advice to people even considering this car Is RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM IT, IT MAY END UP BEING YOUR NIGHTMARE TOO.if you are unfortunate enough to have purchased this car this is what happened TO USwarning signs of impending complications:back seats wouldn't lower when the button was pushed
tailgate wouldn't close using the button
main computer screen went blank
using auto start the car wouldn't let me in
garage door opener would only work some of the time
oh yes the most exciting thing FRICKING CAR DIED AT 2 SEPERATE INTERSECTIONS!!!
THE DEALERSHIP HAS INSTALLED 2 NEW COMPUTERS AND NOTHING AT ALL!! DAY 22 HEADING INTO DAY 23Update from Apr 7, 2016:I should have stated I first noticed the problems 1 month and 4 days after I received the car, that is when the computer screen went black, the next problem was approx. 2 days later the rear seats wouldn't go down after pressing the button, then about 1 or 2 days later I was warming the car and I couldn't open the door after about 5 tries the car shut down and the door opened, during the entire week of everything else happening the garage door opener only worked some of the time, and the last thing to go wrong was on March 8th when the car died In the intersections. today is April 7th and the  car isn't being worked on anymore they never got it to start, so the garage pushed it to the back lot of the dealership. I had to hire a lawyer because we weren't getting anywhere with Ford Headquarters I am still waiting for a call back from about 3 weeks ago.Update from Apr 25, 2016:tomorrow will be day 50 without my car!!! it was never started!!!!! I am totally unsatisfied with FORD MOTOR COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WE ALL KNOW ITS A  BIG FAT LEMON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Update from Jul 20, 2016:ok here it comes! total time in the shop the first time a whopping 68 days!!!!! replaced timing chain, computer, and ENGINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DEALERSHIP HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! returned it to me with front end damage cracked and chipped bumper, broken headlight, broken mud flap, rear floor mats missing!!!!!!!!
returned it for body work and other repairs caused from Brooklyn Ford/ Guthrie ford now they had it another 7 days!!!!! 75 days I did not have my car.
Headquarters not buying car back~~~~~heading to court to get rid of this anchor around our throats!!!From what I have experienced from this encounter:
when looking at a newer car with low mileage check the car fax!!!!!!!!!!
did you know that only a court can call a car a lemon!
so if an owner accepts an offer and doesn't go to court that car is still out there!!!!!!!
makes me wonder how many are out there!
and if you do decide to go to court your wait time is 1 to 3 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! despicable!!!!!!!!!!!

This was on a brand new vehicle that I went to pick-up from dealership. I also checked four other new Edges on the dealer lot and they all had the same problem. Dealership said it was because there wasn't enough carpet there? We didn't accept the vehicle and they said they would fix the problem. We'll see what their fix will be??? 
BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THAT FORD HAS DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THIS CONTINUED QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEM AND POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE! 
Truly unbelievable and unacceptable for a $45,000 Titanium Edition Edge.Dennis M. Loftis
Conway, SC, USAPrior Complaint Reported:
The driver side carpet above the dead-pedal right by the OBDII sensor has no place to clip. The dealer replaced this carpet once under warranty but the piece of carpet did not appear any different. The issue is the edge by the dead-pedal cannot attach to any place and falls down on the driver's foot. If the driver uses his or her foot for driving (applying the brake) this could be an extremely dangerous situation which could catch the driver's foot and render the driver helpless. Ford needs to fix this issue by permanently attaching the top of the carpet to the vehicle.
Update from Jan 22, 2016: The car finally got back from the dealership and this is what they told us:
There is no fix for the sagging carpet. We have checked other Ford Edge vehicles for sale and all of them had the exact same problem. There is no place to secure the carpet except to make a hole and tie a zip tie up past the electrical.
That does not sound like a very good idea to be as the wires could eventually rub through the wires causing a fire. Therefore there does not really seem to be a good solution at this point.

While driving down the interstate, the car stopped accelerating suddenly. Many check warning signals began flashing. Service traction control, Service Stability track, and Low power ignited began flashing. The car would not go over 10 mph. I got the car pulled over and called roadside assistance. Roadside assistance told me to turn off the traction control and try the car then. An overwhelming aroma of gas/fumes filled the car. I turned off the traction control and turned the car back on. I checked the engine for smoke, looked under the car for leaks, I could see nothing. I started down the interstate and the car worked fine for 3 miles. Then the car stopped again and the warnings began again.In 3 miles I lost 7 gallons of gas and the car stopped and never turned back on. I had to have the car towed to a dealership in Knoxville that was closed. I was 400 miles from home with my son and stranded. The dealership wouldn't be open until Monday morning and I had to somehow get home. I was forced to get a rental car to drive home the next day.The dealership called and said it was the full pump and that it would be 7-10 days before the car could be repaired. Of course they would only cover 5 days car rental. They explained it was going to take that long because the part was backordered nationwide. None of this was my fault, but I was going to have to pay for a rental car and then drive back to Knoxville to pick it up. I had to take a day off work and drive 12 hours to go get my car once it was ""fixed"". Now, how the full pump made the stability track and traction control signals flash, no one explained to me. I did learn that the odor was fuel leaking and that when I followed the roadside assistant's advice and restarted the car, the car could have caught fire and seriously injured all of us inside. Since picking the car up, my gas mileage has been incorrect and flutes while the car is turned off. One day, I lost 20 miles while I ate lunch. I have video of the rpm's fluctuating in idol and as you accelerate. The car hasn't operated the same since the repair. The worst part is the car just did THE EXACT SAME THING as I drove to work this morning! I was stranded in the middle of a busy intersection! I am so lucky I haven't gotten injured or killed when this car suddenly dies. It is being towed to another service center. Luckily, I am not 400 miles away from home this time.This is not the only mechanical issue I have had with this car.

I have video evidence of all of the issues with this car. I started taking video when I returned home from picking the car up and noticed I kept losing gas and the backup camera kept switching on. This car is an accident waiting to happen. It isn't safe and I definitely don't feel safe carrying my children in it or allowing my eldest son to drive it.

On this past Monday James called us & asked had anyone contacted us when we said no to which he seemed to be shocked & then stated he was going to call them & get right back to us. It's now Wednesday we haven't heard from James(Headquarter) nor Robert or Jeffery of(Jack Maxton) our holiday was ruined to say the least!! We feel like instead of them causing us an inconvenience of driving 30 miles there & back(gas & time) for a vehicle which is brand new they should just replace it with one that does not have these issues. Of course the condensation does not stay so by the time we can get car to dealer is gone!! But we made pictures & video. This was to be a second vehicle for us we were planning on also purchasing a Chevy Suburban but after this we are done with Chevrolet & will change to Lincoln or another type vehicle for our next purchase! FORWARD TO HJNICHOLSON@CRIMSON.UA.E¡¦ Read lessWell it now seem's as though we'll miss our God daughter's christianing on 4/10/16 in New York because it seem's as though Jame's (who was to get back to me on Monday 3/27/16 number 866-790-5700 EXT: 591-3683 )has now disappeared!! It is now 4/1/16 Friday & we've not heard from him nor Jeffery or Robert!! Don't want to leave for extended vacation in a brand new car with issue's. This is really inconvenience for us. You know they always say bring the vehicle in when you have the problem again but it happened after they were closed the condensation will be gone a day later but we do have video & photo's of problem. If they treat a customers such as us who has had a relationship for over 15 years with them how do you expect them to treat new customers!! Wish we'd read some of these reviews prior to purchasing our new vehicle Anyone with some good legal advice!!!Update from Apr 14, 2016:Chevrolett replaced both lights we did not receive a work order but did receive a 6 page document IDL4375388 when our vehicle was returned explaining how replacing the lights still may not solve the issue & how it is normal to have condensation due to air inside the lamp assembly, through atmospheric changes reaching dew point.  This should have been pointed out prior to us purchasing this vehicle not after so even though they gave us a $50.00 gas card we are still very unhappy knowing this may not solve the issue on a brand new car.  I will scan the explanation they sent to us & send it.  This is the 2nd time replacing the light on drivers side(tail light)Update from May 9, 2016:TAIL LIGHTS HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED TWICE ALREADY LAST TIME DONE BEGINNING OF APRIL.

I turned on the ignition, had my foot on the brake, put it into reverse and next thing I knew I was hurtling backwards. It felt like being sucked backward and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I smashed into the car behind me and it was terrifying both for me and, I'm sure, for the guy behind me who suddenly had this SUV crashing into the front of his car. He thought his car was totaled. The insurance companies are handling it, but I told both my insurance company and Enterprise that I thought the Traverse had surged. I did eventually drive the vehicle back home (avoiding reverse completely), and noticed when the car was in cruise control mode that same surge-feeling in drive when going up a hill--like it was going way too fast. Later, I saw online a complaint of a similar thing (reverse surge) happening with a 2009 Traverse. I don't think this car should be on the road, and the people handling the claim for Enterprise say that it's not (which is good), but they just warned me that if their inspection doesn't show a problem with the vehicle, I could be liable for expenses since it has been pulled from their fleet.",Traverse Expe,2016

We contacted our insurance company and they told us to have the car towed to our preferred body shop, which we did. The dr X-rayed my knees and determined they were not broken, just badly bruised. On Dec 26th, I went back to the dr because I started having some pain in my neck/shoulder and they did numerous tests, finding what they thought was a fracture in my neck. I had to wear a brace on it for a week, then more testing determined that what they saw was actually a previous injury that had never been caught. I need physical therapy on the neck issue. I have since found that there are several complaints of these cars suddenly lurching forward when the brake is applied, over a span of 7 years.

I negotiated the car to the shoulder and saw that the entire housing/casing of his seatbelt buckle had spontaneously exploded.

I had it towed to Auto Nation in Laurel MD. They discovered a crack in the transmission housing. They said it was likely a defect when it was made and never caught, which means it was also likely slowly leaking transmission fluid since before I bought it.

However, the steering wheel is located within the average persons field of view of the indication screen, thus making the indication screen useless until a major body adjustment, up or down, is made.

While acc is enabled, say your vehicle comes to fullstop as vehicle in front has come to a full stop(say at traffic signal) and acc applies full brakes. Traffic ahead starts moving again, but since vehicle won't move on its own driver is required to press accelerator to get it moving again or acc to resume its operation (this is by design). In such scenario if driver ends up pushing accelerator a bit harder(I.e. more than just tapping it), acc applies very strong brakes stopping vehicle right there. By this time vehicle behind you has started moving already and might rear-end due to abrupt stop. I guess acc thinks distance between you and vehicle ahead is very less and thinks its going to collide and hence applies strong brakes. But this is a bad design/programming since it expects driver to push acc. Pedal for acc to resume operations, but if driver does it bit more than what acc likes, there is a chance of accident.

It seems to be potentially when the V6 converts to run on just 4 cylinders or something, at those RPMs.I'm no technician or engine person.

They said they tested another similar vehicle on lot - same issue.
Said to drive it still, for a couple thousand more miles and said that my car would 'learn' and adapt to my drive style. I didn't believe that would happen but did as instructed.A few weeks later, at around 2000 miles total, returned from a 5 hour round trip on non-interstate roads...with close to what I would compare to stress from having ridden in the vibration for pretty much the whole way, constant flat road speeds with the engine settling around 1600 RPMS for most of the trip.Emailed dealer that the vibration is still there, totally ruining my new car experience, and that I hate driving this because of this vibration.

This vehicle was a dealer trade because our local dealer didn't have one with the equipment I wanted and in the color I wanted. I test drove an Acadia Denali that the dealer had and was pleased. My salesperson drove to a neighboring state to drive back the Acadia I now have. I live about 20 miles from the dealership. The night I drove it home involved city stop and go driving then about a 12 mile stretch of 4 lane highway before arriving in the small town I live in. Just before I got on the highway I felt a slight vibration in the steering wheel and assumed it was rough road. Once on the highway I felt the vibration again and it felt like I ran over the rumble strips that are on the side of the road and along the center stripe. The vibration faded away. I approached a slow moving car and had to slow down before changing lanes to pass. As I passed the car and got up to 60/61 mph I felt the vibration again. Once again it slowly faded away. This happened 3 more times in that short stretch of highway. This is an AWD equipped Acadia and I was driving it in 2 wheel drive. Now I'm concerned. I told my husband about it when I got home and he said he would drive it the next day to check it out. A couple of days went by and he finally drove it the following Friday and he felt the same thing. He agreed that something isn't right and that we should take it back to the dealer. That day I started googling the situation and have come across many other 2017 Acadia owners with the same problem. The disturbing part is that no one can diagnose the problem, and from what I'm seeing, GM claims it's normal. This is NOT normal! I still have not registered my Acadia because I am finishing out a lease on a Buick Lacrosse that's been a dream car. The Acadia is sitting in my garage, and frankly, I'm hesitant to drive it or register it. It really makes me sick to look at that beautiful vehicle and not know whether the problem can be fixed or not. I called our dealer on Friday and made an appointment to have them take a look at the truck next week. I'm trying to stay calm and give the dealer a chance to diagnose and fix the problem.

They have replaced the rear transmission mount and the vibration is still there.  They plan to replace the front transmission mount and I fully expect the vibration will still be there.Update from Mar 27, 2017:March 27, 2017.  Upgrading the front and rear transmission mounts has not eliminated the vibration in my Acadia.  My dealer has given all info to GM Technical and they said they are going to send a field engineer to inspect and drive my truck.  I am hoping that the field engineer can figure this out.Update from Jun 2, 2017:My issue has finally been resolved!  I received an email from another Acadia owner with the same problem giving me the number of a service bulletin that fixed the vibration.  The service bulletin is 17-na-168.

That said I would counsel anyone one considering the new body style 2017 Acadia with the new 3.6L V6 engine, to do a complete evaluation of the car you are considering for this problem.Here is the issue,.. there is a very audible drumming and vibration felt in the steering wheel and seats when the engine is in the V4 mode in two wheel (FWD) mode when the engine RPM's are between 1500 and 1750. This engine speed unfortunately corresponds to a highway speed of 56 to 63 miles an hour (MPH) and an in town speed of 28-40 MPH depending on the gear (which is precisely where most of my driving occurs). To add insult to the situation we had an occasion in the last few day to require the AWD to be engaged at interstate speed of 70-75 MPH (now with the engine in the V6 mode) and the drumming and vibration was constant, very concerning, annoying and unpleasant and did not cease until the vehicle was stopped and switched to the FWD mode.I have had the vehicle to the GM dealer who is extremely helpful and they confirm the problem, I also drove an identical model on the lot and it has the same issue. GM technical line was consulted and denied knowledge of the issue, suggested re-settling the driveline by loosening running the mounting points, then retighten to specs the motor and transmission mounts along with the exhaust system. This was done and resulted in no improvement, GM was informed and reported back that this was a ""normal operating characteristic"".I again would advise anyone to completely evaluate any 2017 Acadia (new model) with the 3.6L V6 engine for this issue before purchase. In fact with so many other great crossover vehicles available in this class look elsewhere.. consider yourself cautioned.Update from Nov 28, 2016:Now with over 2700 miles on the vehicle I am certain the vibration and drumming occurs at all times.

Rattle is noticeable when you are going on a bit bad(note road doesn't have to be very bad or you don't have to go off-road) city roads and at usual city drive speeds. Sound is less noticeable on Freeways at those speeds.
Most of the Rattle seemed to be coming from 2nd row Driver-side seat. And from observations it seems rattle comes when the 2nd row seats vibrates for whatever reason. Some rattle was also probably coming from 3rd row seats when they vibrated.Took it to the dealer and had one of their mechanic come for a test drive. On one of the bad patch, he could instantly hear it and acknowledged the issue. Kept it at servicing center for 2 days. They said the 2nd row seats were making most of the rattle and it was due to lose seat release cables. They secured the loose cables and returned the vehicle. Said they need to order 2nd row seat hand rest/cup holder since that was the one making most sound.Currently waiting for them to get the ordered component and get it replaced. But at this point I can still hear some rattle from 2nd row and now more from passenger side seat. To be honest many a times it seems the rattle is coming from lot of different places like : inside of multiple seats, inside of doors.For car this expensive I would have expected GMC to give me a very luxurious throughly Quality tested vehicle. Hearing rattle from Day1 is a big question mark on Quality Control Department of GMC. Rattle so obvious should have never made it to production. What I am most worried about is, since this is a all-new platform for 2017 year model, hopefully there is no fundamental issue with frame/body integrity which is just getting manifested as rattle at this point.

Motorized lift gate mechanism trashed itself a few weeks ago. As the door was closing the hydraulic arm pulled itself loose from the plastic housing then the motion of the lift gate smashed the hydraulic arm down against the plastic housing trashing it and the plastic piece below it. 
The weather was warm, above freezing, the car was thoroughly warmed up. There was no junk in the back or anything in the way of the operation of the lift gate, the hydraulic arm, or any other part whatsoever. 
Dealer claims that it was somehow my fault and they won't fix it under warranty. 
The hydraulic arm is obviously broken and the plastic housing is trashed and the one below it is cracked. I am unable to use the lift gate since I can never be sure that the gate will close all the way and if the gate is not all the way closed there is a risk of exhaust gas entering the car through the back due to the suction produced by the forward motion of the car. 
In other words, to use the lift gate manually wold present a safety hazard.

Each time it happened was when I was merging from an on ramp into traffic. The last occurance, and I believe the others as well, I was going approx 35mph, staying steady on the speed looking for a spot in traffic to merge into, giving it gas and started my merge only to feel and hear no change in RPM or speed, giving it more and more petal, and still no change in speed at all, after avoiding the other driver that almost hit me because of it, I moved back over and had a moment and tried again to get into the petal at almost wide open throttle and still no RPM change and no movement up in speed (also still no loss of speed), during each occurrence the car was smooth (no engine bucking just wouldn't respond to gas input). The same symptoms have occured the three times it's occured. The resolve each time was the same, let off the gas for 1-2 secs, give it gas and the car drove again as normal. Dealership has looked at my car with no explination, no trouble codes were generated, and they stated tranny fluid was fine. It acted like the cvt was stuck on a particular band and also wouldn't allow any additional gas, hence no additional speed. The last occurance it was about 35 degrees out.

After that, I still noticed the light would intermittently be on while there was a passenger in the seat. Specifically, myself or my daughter. Both of us are 110-120 lb adults. I again returned the car to Nissan who admitted that there is no definite weight that will activate the airbag and the 110-120 range is indeterminate. The suggestion was that I pull over and restart the car to reset the system to recognize a passenger in the seat. I am unable to establish any pattern of what causes it to happen. It seems very random. Occasionally when at a stop light, the car will recalculate and activate the airbag. I would estimate 40% of the time a passenger is in the seat, the light illuminates to indicate the airbag is off. I feel this is a faulty and dangerous design. No one disclosed when I bought the car I may not have airbag protection. Initially I was told the weight setting was anything greater than 70lbs would activate the airbag which is reasonable to protect smaller infant passengers that shouldn't be in the front seat to begin with.

Both times I was able to pull unto the shoulder and drive a short distance to a gas station to fill the tank which took only slightly over 15 gallons and the tank holds 19 gallons. I have found the identical complaint on several web sites and there does not seem to be any help from Nissan or even an admittance that the problem exits. I just returned from my dealer in naples, fl. And all they could tell me was that no error codes were showing and I could not expect the gauge to be accurate at all times since it is constantly recalculating and changing distance to empty. That really has nothing to do with the problem since the car was apparently not out of gas and in the past I have put over 18 gallons in the tank so I am certain it was not out of gas. I believe there must be a problem with the pickup tube, sensors or a combination of both.

Before I could get to a gas station, the car suddenly became sluggish and would not go over 20 miles per hour. The engine did not turn off indicating it still had gas. I was about a mile and a half from an exit and was able to drive on the shoulder and get to a station and refill the car. I topped it off at 16 gallons (car holds 19). The car ran fine after it was full. This was a dangerous situation given that traffic was moving at 70 miles per hour when the car dropped to 20 miles per hour. I called Nissan usa and my dealer and was told they couldn?T do anything unless an engine light came on or they could replicate the problem. In March 2016, the car fuel light again came on while on a residential road. While the car registered 35 miles left until empty, the car again became sluggish and would not exceed 20 mph. I drove to a gas station and topped it off at 15.5 gallons. This time, like the last, the car worked normally when it was full. In April 2016, the dealer agreed to replace the two fuel level sensors. Since then I have not had the issue but also have filled up before or immediately after the fuel light comes on. Each time I have only been able to get slightly over 15 gallons in the tank.

Each time it happened was when I was merging from an on ramp into traffic. The last occurance, and I believe the others as well, I was going approx 35mph, staying steady on the speed looking for a spot in traffic to merge into, giving it gas and started my merge only to feel and hear no change in RPM or speed, giving it more and more petal, and still no change in speed at all, after avoiding the other driver that almost hit me because of it, I moved back over and had a moment and tried again to get into the petal at almost wide open throttle and still no RPM change and no movement up in speed (also still no loss of speed), during each occurrence the car was smooth (no engine bucking just wouldn't respond to gas input). The same symptoms have occured the three times it's occured. The resolve each time was the same, let off the gas for 1-2 secs, give it gas and the car drove again as normal. Dealership has looked at my car with no explination, no trouble codes were generated, and they stated tranny fluid was fine. It acted like the cvt was stuck on a particular band and also wouldn't allow any additional gas, hence no additional speed. The last occurance it was about 35 degrees out. I have tried to reproduce the problem many times with no success at all, and with no codes being generated to point the dealefship to any issue, this is a big safety concern for me and my family as it goes unresolved.-Dudley, MA, USA",Murano,2016

Of note is that the 2016 Murano has already received an update.I have been told by the Nissan Navigation site that the manufacturer has to push through an update and that Nissan has not made one available. Nissan blames the Navigation site for not having an update available (highly doubtful as the data is available for the 2016 model update?!?). Also, per the Nissan Navigation site, the average update occurs between 18-24 months. Since the version I have is 2013-14, it is now over 4 years old.With the way that roads have been changing in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, the directions on the Navigation system are frequently wrong and may result in accidents when told to take a right exit which is now on the left.

Her next problem was that the car is now moving forward and brakes still not responding. She threw the car into park before colliding with our neighbors car. After calming my wife down, I asked my her to step out of the car so I can take a look for myself. When I got into the driver seat I noticed the brake pedal was almost to the floor. There was maybe about an inch of play on the pedal. Opened case with Nissan Consumer Affairs and was told there wasn't any recalls for my vehicle. A quick google search proved that to be untrue. Not happy being lied to.Arrived at the dealer to discuss the issue with the service adviser and he told me the recall was for cars ABS system. But it does not affect my vehicle. He proceeded to ask me several questions about the incident. One question that really bothered me was if we by any chance had bumped our car in the front end or maybe someone hit our front bumper. My answer was ""No, why?"" He informed that they have seen where people bump the front bumper and brake the sensor that works with the ""forward collision warning"" system. This system is supposed to apply the brakes before colliding with the car in front of you. Well he informed that if this sensor is damaged, they've seen that it causes the brakes to stop working.

Car started to hesitate and jerk when accelerating at low speeds -- like taking off from a stop or accelerating onto the freeway. Problem reported to dealership, but was not addressed. I'd taken the care in because the Service Engine light came on after refueling -- could be operator error with not fastening the gas cap properly or could be from the dealership service dept identified ""small leak"" on gas cap. Either way, Service Advisor said the gas cap problem should not have caused any hesitation or jerking. Picked up the car after leaving it overnight and on the way home, the jerking started again and became more frequent over the weekend. Made an apt at Dealership Service Dept --This ticks me off -- as an owner of a very expensive new car, why do I have to make an appointment several days to two weeks out to even get them to do some basic trouble-shooting, diagnostics? Once I purchased the car, what happened to all that good will about keeping me happy? Yes, they provide a free rental replacement when they keep the car, but it's a total hassle to spend over an hour dropping off a vehicle that shouldn't even be having any problems yet! End of rant.They've had my car since Thursday, 7 July, and today is Tuesday, 12 July. I received a voice message on Friday afternoon letting me know I should plan to be in the rental until at least the end of this week. Service Advisor said he would update me on Monday (yesterday), but no call or message. I called him this morning, but have not heard back from him yet. Initial message from last Friday said it is definitely a transmission problem and he has contacted Nissan and is waiting for them to send parts. I'm hoping to get some more definitive information about the specific problem and plan for resolution of same......but I'm very disappointed to have such a major problem with a brand new vehicle! My last car was a 2003 Murano that I bought new -- loved it and never had any significant problems with it. Decided to upgrade to the 2016 model because I'd finally gone over 100,000 miles on the 03 and it was beginning to need more than routine maintenance -- coils needed replaced, electronic door locks were failing, leather on driver's seat side had cracked, and the car had picked up some minor parking lot dings and scratches -- 13 years old but still had good shine and ran great. Guess I should have held onto it for another few years. Wondering if anyone else has experienced transmission issues with 2016 Murano.Finally was able to talk to the Service Advisor this afternoon and he told me they will be replacing the entire transmission. He said that's how Nissan does it -- when the transmission fails this soon, they want it back at the factory so they can break it down to figure out the problem. He said they had recently (did not specify which year) changed the CVT from being belt driven to chain driven so the CVT of this year is quite different from the CVT of my 2003 model. Interesting that with the solution being to totally replace the transmission, there never was an alert light or indicator saying there was a problem with the car. Perhaps that's why it gets a new transmission? With no magic code telling them what to fix, they're stumped? Hopefully, this will resolve the problem for good. Would still like to know if this is unique to my car or if there is an overall flaw with this model or the ""new"" CVT chain technology.Update from Jan 1, 2017:Solution was for Nissan Dealership to work with Nissan Headquarters to obtain a new transmission.  This wasn't an easy option, they had to provide video evidence of the problem, etc.  Because mileage was so low, Nissan wanted the faulty transmission removed completely and returned to their factory so they could ""autopsy"" it to determine root cause.  Dealership successfully swapped out the faulty transmission for a new one shipped to them from the factory.  Car was off road for nearly a month during this time -- dealership provided free rental car with no hassle.Since the transmission replacement, I have not experienced any further transmission problems.  Car now has just over 3,000 miles on it.Separate problem was identified as a very small leak in the evap system -- this is what would cause the Service Engine light to come on.  At first the problem seemed to be caused by failure to properly close gas cap after refueling.  After much insistence, the techs finally isolated actual leak.  New part ordered and replacement made.  Problem solved and Service Mgr conceded the problem was real and not caused by operator.All has been good since these two problems have been fixed by Nissan of Chesapeake.  Service Advisorswere Ray and Scott.",Murano Platinum V6,2016

after restarting the car, noted that the VDC sign is still in the dash board along with engine malfunction sign.
the vehicle is still new 412 kms, when it happened.
 notified the service center and they repaired the car and called me the next day.
they informed me they reprogram the computer and tested the car they drove the car around 100 kms to test.
i decided to check he car, and i saw the sign is already gone. but i decided to restart the car and did it in the presence of the technician itself. unfortunately the engine malfunction sign came back. THE TECHNICIAN SAID SORRY AND HE PROMISED ME THEY CHECKED THE CAR BY DRIVING 100KMS. I CHECKED THE DASH board it was more then 500 kms. i left the car there and returned home.
Two days back they called me from service center informing car is repaired and ready. when i reached the service station they informed me , they change a sensor in the engine and every thing is fine.
so i took the car and no problem was found for 2 days.
 the third day again the VDC sign came while driving and it stayed instead of blinking(as per the users manual even when the VDC is activated the sign will only blink 3 times, not stay persistent). and engine breaking was activated . i stopped the car in a near by parking and restarted the car, the sign disappeared .
the next day, after a long trip, the odometer reached 1000 kms and and was about to complete the journey, the VDC sign came again, and the engine breaking applied by the car in the motorway.a really dangerous situation in which i couldn't increase the speed but,steadily decreasing the speed.
luckily no accident happened but the ongoing vehicles has to stop and i could here the other vehicles are applying the horn and shouting on me. i restarted the car and the sign disappeared.
with this incident i gone mad and i called the service center and i informed them about the safety issues.
i told them it could be a manufacturing defect. but they are not taking it seriously . today i called them and they informed me, they are going to change the whole computer system in my car and they are waiting for the approval from the company. and it will take 2 more days.

No way any car should be made for that to happen, otherwise it would affect gas mileage and performance and power.I took it in May 2015 two months after I bought it because I felt something was wrong with the way air and heat operated. I took it to Lander Nissan for them to look at it because they was closer to my house, he agreed of something didn¡¯t sound right under the hood when I turned on my air or heat but that it would take a few days to get me into the shop. The same day I took it on out to Wolfchase Nissan where I bought the truck, they had a guy to come out to listen he also was concerned on the sound the compressor was making when I cut on the heat, the compressor was clicking in and for me to bring it back in. I took in back up there like he said, the guy comes out there asking me what is it doing. I told him.He sat in the truck with me and we turn the switch from heat to air. Once he heard the sound of the air compressor coming on he told me that it is supposed to operate that way because new cars is set up that way. Late Sept I took it back to Lander Nissan for a oil change alone with having them to check this problem out again, they told me again that this is design this way.Fri Oct 2nd I couldn't take it anymore, I left work and took it back out to Nissan bc I know something was wrong now. Now that the weather has changed and I needed to run heat. The heat wasn¡¯t hot and again when I would turn the heat on you can hear the compressor engaging. He called and told me that its fixed and the problem was that it was a lose heater hose clamp in the cooling system not allowing the heat to get hot which in return caused compressor to come on.I was pleased at the point thinking that the problem had been taken care of and know that I wasn¡¯t crazy thinking that this was something going on in my head alone.. the minute I left the dealership I notice the heat wasn¡¯t getting hot still so I waited for the next day to call him back¡¦¡¦ he told me why don¡¯t I ride it out until it gets a little cooling in weather.

It usually happens at slows speeds when accelerating slowly.I had mentioned this issue many times during service and in 20K km service they told me that it is fixed by reprogramming the CVT engine. But again the same problem was there and last week in 50K km service they told that it is fixed permanently by replacing the CVT engine.Three days after the service I went for a trip with my family from Dubai to Salalah in Oman. While returning back the jerking problem started again and engine warning sign was showing in the car. It looked liked the gear transmission was not working properly and car was not moving forward even with full acceleration and rpm. I couldn't drive the car and I was stuck on the road in the desert at mid night for hours with my family and kids. I contacted Oman police for help they checked the problem and advised me not to drive. The car was then taken to Dubai border by recovery which costed me 1400 AED and my family came to Dubai border with Oman Police and then by taxi to home by paying AED 400. The leisure trip turned to be a nigtmare for me and my family because of the issue with car.Now I don't feel comfortable at all driving this car which has a manufacturing defect and which is having problems after service.

I've had it into the shop 3 times to look at it. They always say that unless it ""throws a code"" there's nothing they can do. The 1st time I had it in, they said they couldn't duplicate the problem. I even went and drove it and couldn't make it do it. Over time, the problem got worse and more easy to replicate, so they wanted to ride with me the next time. The 2nd time I had it in (August 2016), the technician rode with me, with a computer hooked up to watch the transmission while it happened. He witnessed it and said the gear ratio was really low but it wasn't throwing a code. There was a software update available for the transmission at the time so they applied that. (Free of charge when there was supposedly a charge for updates.)I drove the car a few more weeks and maybe it's psychological, but ever since the update, my gas mileage was slightly lower (about 1mpg), the shudder problem was ever present at low speeds and it had even begun to slip very slightly going from Park to Reverse and again from Reverse to Drive. I called them back and they were optimistic that if it was starting to slip, then it would register it to the computer and have a code.I took it back in yesterday (September 27th) for a scheduled appointment and the first thing they did was check for codes. The slipping hadn't triggered any codes but the shudder now HAD! AND... there was a TSB released for it in April. The TSB states for them inspect / replace the valve body in the CVT, if there is a large amount of wear, then they are to replace the whole CVT.My car is scheduled to go back in next tuesday, (October 4th, 2016) to have them dive into the transmission. I'm hoping for the best. Wish me luck.Update from Oct 7, 2016:I took my car in on Tuesday.  They finally got the diagnosis and approval that the entire CVT needs to be replaced.

It came back on a day or so later. On 1/28 while it was still not working I took it to the dealership. First tech said that he thought the entire stereo/navigation system would have to be replaced but it was Sat and had to wait on Nissan for direction. Was then called on 1/30 by Nissan to state that it is a ""software"" issue and that it could take weeks or MONTHS before Nissan comes up with an update since the car is new.Am I supposed to accept having no radio and bad data or weeks or months on a BRAND NEW CAR!!

Took it to original dealership (Beaman Toyota, Nashville, TN) at 5,000 maintenance service. They balanced all tires and aligned front end. Next day, still same problem. At 10,000 miles, took it to a dealership in my city (Ron Hibbard, GALLATIN, TN). They again aligned the front end and balanced all four tires. Stated tires improperly balanced. Drove vehicle for several days and noticed the shimmy was still there between 60-65mph. Went on Summer vacation. When returned, took vehicle back to Gallatin, TN dealership at about 13,000 miles. They worked with Toyota and got new tires approved. They suggested replacing DUNLOP tires with GOODYEAR WRANGLER tires. The put the new tires on and then ""force road balanced"" the tires. Told me the problem was fixed. Next morning, took my wife to work and still had the shimmy! Back to the dealership. Service manager doesn't know what to say. States they never had a problem like this before. It was as if I was making an untruthful statement about the shimmy. It was pretty bad. He took it for a drive and said it was characteristic of other 4Runners on the lot he drove. I asked to drive another vehicle from the lot. Prior to that, the Used Car Lot had a brand new 2016 4Runner traded in with only 780 miles on it! The sales manager agreed to let me drive it. I noted a ""slight"" shimmy at 60-65mph... It had DUNLOP tires - same as my original tires. The shimmy on that vehicle was nowhere as bad as my vehicle which now has 17,500 miles. The next day, the Service Manager and I took a brand new 4Runner SR5 (with Bridgestone tires) for a test drive. There was absolutely no shimmy in the steering!!! We then took mine out. It had some shimmy, not as bad as most days on the way into town with my wife. I spoke with the son of the dealership owner several weeks later while at the dealership. Mentioned the problem with my vehicle and said I would like to get it fixed. He said he was driving a Demo 4Runner and noticed a shimmy the first few miles he drove it. He wanted me to trade in my 4Runner and said he had no problem with the shimmy. Of course, that would be a big loss $$$-wise for me. On 10/17/2016, I contacted Toyota Customer Customer Experience Center and reported the problem. She kept asking me what I wanted. I kept saying I liked the vehicle, but would like Toyota to FIX THE SHIMMY! Gave her the complete rundown above. She contacted the dealer and they agreed to check it out again. I took it in yesterday morning. Got a call from the Service Foreman stating they checked everything out and couldn't find a thing. I advised they keep it overnight and take it for a test drive this morning and get it up to 63mph and they'll feel the shimmy. I also requested they take a set of wheels (with the Bridgestone tires) off their new 4Runner and put them on my vehicle and let me drive it overnight. I would drive it back in the next morning and tell them if that fixed the problem. He has to get permission from higher up. I mentioned Toyota had an open complaint case on this and they should help foot the bill for that so I can resolve in my mind whether this fixes the problem. I've read a lot on the different websites like ""toyota-4runn.org"", ""cargurus.com"" and ""edmunds.com"" and it appears there has been a ""LONG-STANDING"" history of problems with shimmy and vibration in the 4Runner. So, Toyota should not be dismissing this as a ""characteristic"" of the 4Runner or that ""they have never seen this problem before."" This is my second Toyota and we loved the previous Toyota Highlander. However, if Toyota can't or refuses to resolve this, I do have other options (as Airlines remind us when we fly). So, I may just invoke other options to resolve a problem they refuse to fix...TOYOTA - if you are reading this, feel free to contact me and let me know what you can do to resolve this. I'm sure you can figure out who I am just by going to Ron Hibbard in Gallatin, TN... Thank you.,",4Runner SR5 Premium 4.0L V6,2016

1705,miscellaneous,unknown_or_other,Townsend,USA,Jul 15,toyota,highlander,2015.0,35 miles,"We recently test drove several new cars. After being in each of the cars for less than an hour, we had very strong headaches. As a rule, we don?T get headaches, so these were very obviously the result of breathing the air in these new cars. Car interiors are made using plastics, adhesives, fire-retardants and other materials, many of which off-gas highly toxic fumes. I found no Agency which currently tests vehicles for the presence of these toxics. We test drove a used Toyota Highlander and we did not get a headache in that vehicle, but we could not find a used one that was equipped the way we wanted. So we ordered a new one. After we took possession of the car, I drove it home, with all the windows down, the moon roof open and the ventilation fan running at full speed. I then parked the car in our driveway and left it in the sun all day, every day for a month. I had the windows down just slightly and a small fan in the car which stirred the air. I also put a large tray of activated carbon in the car, changing that material every few days. At night, I moved the car into our garage, rolled down all the windows and had an exhaust fan running, which changed the air in the garage several times an hour. After a month of that routine I was able to drive the car without getting a headache. Although I can still feel the effect of that polluted interior air, it is tolerable and improving with time. We now know that this out-gassing process never ends; it only lessens over time; and, contrary to what many still believe, it is also known that long exposures to extremely small doses of toxic materials can be more damaging to human health than a large, short exposure. Given these facts, I strongly suggest that our government add passenger compartment air quality to its safety rating protocol. The auto manufacturers certainly aren?T going to do this of their own Accord.-Port Townsend, WA, USA",Highlander,2015

If a child or adult gets in the way of the liftgate when it is lowering, the child or adult can be seriously injured, crushed or killed because the liftgate has no easy reversing feature. It does reverse when it hits an object but the force required to make it reverse is too great and will hurt or kill a human who gets in the way. People often reach in the trunk to fetch something after the operator decides to close the trunk. If this happens with the power closer, the operator must know the exact location of the stop control either by feel or by sight to stop the operation of the liftgate in order to prevent injury. This is asking too much of the operator. The lift gate should be designed to reverse or stop immediately just like the safety features on automatic garage door closers.

However, we are very unhappy with this vehicle because driver front visibility to the sides is obscured by the overlarge side view mirrors and the window frames; and backup visibility is extremely poor because the rear window design with turned up bottom corners, low placement of rear wiper, and small window size severely reduces what the driver can see when backing up. The backup camera does not clearly show rear obstructions when the car is parked in shade or shadows, or the driver is wearing sunglasses. These are major, crash inducing problems, which we reported to Toyota today. We narrowly avoided two collisions because we did not see vehicles approaching us from the side front of our vehicle; and we narrowly avoided backing into a parked car (in shade) which did not clearly show up on the backup camera. Two of these incidents were in parking areas; the third was driving into a left bend on a road as another vehicle approached head on. All three of these incidents happened in broad daylight, with dry road conditions. We have had this Highlander for only 7 months; and we are both very experienced adult drivers with excellent safety records, which our aaa insurance records will show.

Who wants to have three total brake failures and false dashboard lights showing problems. That's only if your still even alive to apply for the law to help you at all.Moving on, the Dealership Manager was at least a honest fellow. He listened to our concerns and 
offered to buy the Highlander back from us. As their was no way, we could ever drive the Highlander again, after two total brake failures and other faulty electronics in the dash board notification system was very erratic.

something was greatly amiss with the complex computer system, installed in our Highlander..We were very, very scared to even think of getting into our new Highlander.

Called Toyota in July who knew nothing about an update but did receive a call from the dealer who set up another appointment. Took it back in and was advised still no update but they would replace the radio but could not guarantee the radio would not do the same thing. Still waiting on the new radio.Update from Aug 25, 2016:Update:  Dealer replaced the radio on 08/03/16.  New radio same problem, took back to dealer on 8/22 for another update but was told this radio had the latest update available.  They, Toyota, suggested to wipe the radio clean and not link the I-phone or anything to it as this might have been the problem.  Nope still shuts down and reboots.  So now they will replace the radio again.  Third radio in 7 months.Update from Sep 8, 2016:Dealer replaced the radio again.  Still told not to link anything through it.

I went shopping at walmart and parked my 2016 Toyota Highlander xle in the parking lot. I put the car in park and pushed the engine start/stop button to turn off the car. My family and I exited the car and I used the keyless entry pad to lock the doors. We shopped for approximately 45 min. When we returned to the car, I used the keyless entry pad to unlock the doors so I could put our purchases in the trunk. As I got close to the vehicle I heard an engine running, but thought it was the car next to us. I bent down and listened under the front end of my Highlander and to my surprise, I realized my car engine was running. When I opened the driver side door and looked at the dashboard, I noticed a small triangular yellow caution light was flashing but I don't remember what the message said other than caution. If my car randomly starts on its own while its in a garage, it could cause toxic fumes to fill my garage if left on long enough, and could cause harm or death to someone who breathes it in.

My wife drove it for nine years and took impeccable care of it. I started driving it a year ago when we leased a 2013 CR-V for her. A couple of weeks ago, I was making the three mile journey to work when I noticed that my heat was no longer working. After work, the car had some transmission slip when leaving the parking lot. I stopped home briefly to make arrangements to take it to the local Honda dealer. We always had it serviced there ( mostly oil changes, a set of brake pads, etc. As it only had 84,000 mi. On it). On the way to the dealer, who was five miles away, the transmission was slipping more and more. Then, the vehicle started to massively overheat. I'm glad I was not on a busy highway or in heavy traffic. Long story short, after the technician evaluated it, I had a catastrophic failure due to the transmission fluid mixing with the antifreeze. I needed a head gasket for the motor due to the heat, a new radiator that had an internal design failure, and the transmission needed to be replaced as well. A vehicle does not require a mixture of antifreeze and transmission fluid anywhere, nor at any time in the history of automobiles. The repair would have cost nearly what the value of the car was. I called Honda motor Corp. And was offered no help. The value of the car was roughly $10,000. I chose not to proceed with the repair, as I felt it would have been a foolish decision. After my family has owned a half-dozen Honda vehicles, we will never buy another one. I feel that Honda owes me the value of the car due to their overly engineered radiator. We suggested that they put the value of the Pilot against the lease balance on the CRV, they denied that suggestion. The moment the heat went out, I had no idea that my car was already a total loss.

I've noticed in the ads for the 2016 model, that the configuration was changed. I've also seen the notice in the paper that Honda received a 70 million dollar fine for lying about how many people that have been injured and killed in their vehicles. I'm positive this is one of the reasons why. The brakes don't seem to be very reliable, either, getting firmer in cooler weather and grabbing and getting mushy around 70 degrees.

My wife drove it for nine years and took impeccable care of it. I started driving it a year ago when we leased a 2013 CR-V for her. A couple of weeks ago, I was making the three mile journey to work when I noticed that my heat was no longer working. After work, the car had some transmission slip when leaving the parking lot. I stopped home briefly to make arrangements to take it to the local Honda dealer. We always had it serviced there ( mostly oil changes, a set of brake pads, etc. As it only had 84,000 mi. On it). On the way to the dealer, who was five miles away, the transmission was slipping more and more. Then, the vehicle started to massively overheat. I'm glad I was not on a busy highway or in heavy traffic. Long story short, after the technician evaluated it, I had a catastrophic failure due to the transmission fluid mixing with the antifreeze. I needed a head gasket for the motor due to the heat, a new radiator that had an internal design failure, and the transmission needed to be replaced as well. A vehicle does not require a mixture of antifreeze and transmission fluid anywhere, nor at any time in the history of automobiles. The repair would have cost nearly what the value of the car was. I called Honda motor Corp. And was offered no help. The value of the car was roughly $10,000. I chose not to proceed with the repair, as I felt it would have been a foolish decision. After my family has owned a half-dozen Honda vehicles, we will never buy another one. I feel that Honda owes me the value of the car due to their overly engineered radiator. We suggested that they put the value of the Pilot against the lease balance on the CRV, they denied that suggestion. The moment the heat went out, I had no idea that my car was already a total loss.

Took it back to the dealership and they lubricated it and said it was working fine. It still continued to feel too tight - especially when compared to the passenger side. So, I stopped by a Honda dealership and tried the seatbelt in one of their 2016 models and found that it had the same snugness as my vehicle. I have since measured both the driver's seatbelt and the front passenger seatbelt. The result was that the driver's side belt is a full 24 inches shorter than the front passenger belt, when fully extended. I feel that if it is tight on me, it could pose a problem for others as well.

1883,suspension,suspension,PA,USA,Nov 04,honda,pilot,2016.0,"3,000 miles","I write to you to convey my safety concerns regarding a new Honda 2016 Pilot. My attempts to resolve my concerns with american Honda motor co., Inc. Were met with tepid reluctance and a cavalier neglectful attitude. 1.at high speeds (55-75 mph) the vehicle oversteers and during emergency avoidance maneuvers becomes unstable. Twice while avoiding dear on interstate highways, I have almost lost control and was seriously concerned about rolling the vehicle over. I own and have driven a 2003 Pilot for over 180,000 miles and never experienced this sort of issue. I believe the suspension is incorrectly designed and that unexpected and unnecessary rollovers are imminent. 2.the ?auto idle off? feature turns the engine completely off at certain times and under certain circumstances. It takes between 900 and 1,300 milliseconds to recover power to the wheels when this happens. Unlike hybrid vehicles (from which this feature was taken), there is no alternative electrical motor to provide torque to the drivetrain while the engine restarts and as a result, there is delay in accelerating. In the vast majority of times, this is of no consequence however in a small fraction this delay increases the risk of collision. About once per week, I experience a delay in entering dense traffic within short interstate merge lanes. This delay of about one second is enough to remove my margin of error and increases the risk of collision during a merging maneuver. While there is a switch to defeat this feature, it resets every time the vehicle is turned off and remembering to override it every time is inconsistent with human memory and performance.-Pittsburgh, PA, USA",Pilot,2015

The first incident occurred in May 2016 on a busy city street with our three young children in the car. While in motion, the car essentially shut down with the display screen showing a series of warnings indicating numerous system failures. There was no engine power but luckily I was able to coast the vehicle to a nearby parking lot. The dealer indicated there was no problem, just a computer glitch, and the only repair necessary was to reset the computer/software. The second incident occurred last week, only this time while driving on the freeway. We completely lost all engine power but luckily I was in the right lane and I was able to coast to the side and pull over on the shoulder. If I had been in the fast or middle lane with little opportunity to move over, there could have been a serious collision. Similar to the first incident, we were unable to start the car with the warning lights showing various system failures. We had the car towed to the same dealer who initially indicated they would just reboot the software again. So we pressed upon them to do a more thorough diagnosis since this is the second time its happened. They agreed to keep the vehicle and seek to identify the root cause of the problem. At this point no diagnosis has been made. We would have never expected this from a near brand new (purchased in December 2015 and currently has only 9,200 miles) Pilot elite loaded with safety and technology features. Again we experienced two separate incidents where the car immediately shut down while in motion with the most recent occurring on the freeway.

I was driving my car in the normal mode (acc and lkas disabled) on a normal two lane paved road when the car in front of me made a slow right turn. I was not following very closely and came to a complete stop on my own to avoid running into the other car. I stopped about 15 feet away from the other car. The other car then completed the turn to the extent that the other car was no longer in the way of me driving forward in a straight line. When I pushed the gas to then proceed the collision mitigation system started flashing the ""brake"" message and producing an audible warning. At this point I was possibly going 10 mph again. After verifying that there was definitely not anything in my way, I kept applying the gas. My car then started braking on its own, at which point I pushed the gas harder to presumably over-ride the braking. A moment or two later, my car then made a sudden and hard brake on its own that brought my car to a complete stop, despite the fact that I was pushing hard on the gas. The other car that had turned was well clear of the lane by this point, and was easily 1 ft away from my path of travel when I started accelerating in the first place. My only explanation is that the collision mitigation system was confused by the lack of a shoulder lane marker (only a raise cement curb was present) and somehow thought the car was still in the ""road."" In either case, the system malfunctioned to the point that my car was suddenly brought to a complete stop, and the car behind me very nearly rear-ended me in a situation where I had already come to a stop, and the obstacle in front of me had cleared / continued to become increasingly more clear of my path.

I also went online and researched sunroofs breaking out of nowhere and did come across many other similar complaints. It seems that it may be happening more frequently with newer vehicles because they are built lighter with thinner metals and thinner glass. The glass used on sunroofs more commonly is tempered glass, not laminated glass. Tempered glass is more prone to shattering when pressure builds up inside the car. When I spoke to Honda corporate and the dealer, neither one could tell me what kind of glass was on the sunroof because they didn't know. I hope this matter can be further looked into.

My attempts to resolve my concerns with american Honda motor co., Inc. Were met with tepid reluctance and a cavalier neglectful attitude. 1.at high speeds (55-75 mph) the vehicle oversteers and during emergency avoidance maneuvers becomes unstable. Twice while avoiding dear on interstate highways, I have almost lost control and was seriously concerned about rolling the vehicle over. I own and have driven a 2003 Pilot for over 180,000 miles and never experienced this sort of issue. I believe the suspension is incorrectly designed and that unexpected and unnecessary rollovers are imminent. 2.the ?auto idle off? feature turns the engine completely off at certain times and under certain circumstances. It takes between 900 and 1,300 milliseconds to recover power to the wheels when this happens. Unlike hybrid vehicles (from which this feature was taken), there is no alternative electrical motor to provide torque to the drivetrain while the engine restarts and as a result, there is delay in accelerating. In the vast majority of times, this is of no consequence however in a small fraction this delay increases the risk of collision. About once per week, I experience a delay in entering dense traffic within short interstate merge lanes. This delay of about one second is enough to remove my margin of error and increases the risk of collision during a merging maneuver. While there is a switch to defeat this feature, it resets every time the vehicle is turned off and remembering to override it every time is inconsistent with human memory and performance.-Pittsburgh, PA, USA",Pilot,2015

The first incident happened about a month ago before the vehicle even had 900 miles on it and it has re-occurred numerous times since then and we only have 2,000 miles on it. It appears that if you decelerate rather quickly from let's say 50 mph+ to zero, that when you re-start from zero, the transmission is all out of sorts. When you hit the gas at zero (after the fast deceleration) the vehicle will be very hesitant/slow to start (almost as if you?re starting in a higher gear than 1st) and then when you get to about 25-30 mph, the vehicle will slam into that gear and shake the entire vehicle. That 'slamming into gear? issue will continue every time you drop down or accelerate to that 25-30 mph range during that driving session. The only way to get the issue to stop during that driving session, is to stop the vehicle and re-start the engine. It's almost like it resets the transmission or the computer that runs the transmission? there are no check engine lights/warnings that come on and it's a hard issue to duplicate, but the only thing that seems to make it occur sometimes is fast deceleration from a high speed down to zero (I.e. coming off an off-ramp and hitting a stop light, or driving on a 50mph type road and then hitting a stop light). There's obviously a major transmission flaw and the continued ""slamming into gear"" when this issue occurs, can only be doing more damage to the transmission and feels like the engine is on the verge of locking up.-Barre, MA, USA",Pilot,2016

The first incident occurred in May 2016 on a busy city street with our three young children in the car. While in motion, the car essentially shut down with the display screen showing a series of warnings indicating numerous system failures. There was no engine power but luckily I was able to coast the vehicle to a nearby parking lot. The dealer indicated there was no problem, just a computer glitch, and the only repair necessary was to reset the computer/software. The second incident occurred last week, only this time while driving on the freeway. We completely lost all engine power but luckily I was in the right lane and I was able to coast to the side and pull over on the shoulder. If I had been in the fast or middle lane with little opportunity to move over, there could have been a serious collision. Similar to the first incident, we were unable to start the car with the warning lights showing various system failures. We had the car towed to the same dealer who initially indicated they would just reboot the software again. So we pressed upon them to do a more thorough diagnosis since this is the second time its happened. They agreed to keep the vehicle and seek to identify the root cause of the problem. At this point no diagnosis has been made. We would have never expected this from a near brand new (purchased in December 2015 and currently has only 9,200 miles) Pilot elite loaded with safety and technology features. Again we experienced two separate incidents where the car immediately shut down while in motion with the most recent occurring on the freeway.

1985,brakes,service_brakes,PA,USA,Nov 23,honda,pilot,2016.0,40 miles,"Since purchasing new, I have noticed a peculiar phenomenon whereby the brake pedal develops a very high resistance from the time of being parked, until the next time I get in the vehicle. I will routinely depress the brake pedal to place the vehicle in park at the conclusion of a drive. The pedal feels normal at this point. Approximately 80-85% of the time upon re-entry in to the vehicle after allowing the vehicle to sit stationary (off) for 2-12 hours, the brake pedal becomes very firm. To the point where I feel uncomfortable with the amount of force I must press with my foot, in order to the engine to start. I don't want to over-pressure the brake lines unnecessarily. However, most of the time, if I simply press the brake with an average amount of force to start the car, I press the ""start"" button, and the system will only turn on to aux mode, the engine starter will not activate. Due to the highly firm pedal, my ""acceptable"" level of foot force will not sufficiently displace the brake pedal to enable ""engine start"" ready mode. I am perplexed by this odd behavior. I have never experienced this in any other vehicle I have owned in my 17 years of driving experience. I would really like to know how the brake system becomes ""loaded"" if it is just sitting. This is the sort of result I might expect if one were to ""pump"" the brakes without the engine running, but I am doing nothing of the sort. Please Honda, address this.

This happens independent of stereo operation. Research on the topic shows this is an old problem from the prior generation Pilot, and also exists on Acura TLX. Based on solutions found by forum members, the root cause is an under-engineered circuit for the A/C compressor clutch solenoid. Whenever the solenoid (de)activates the A/C compressor, a spike is emitted through the electrical system. When the vehicle is new, the clutch relays absorb the shock. As the relays wear, they can no longer absorb the electrical shock so the interference is heard through the stereo. Simply replacing relays is a stop-gap measure. The relays will continue to see the spikes and eventually they are ineffective from filtering the spikes. In my video below, the vehicle is only seven months old.",Pilot Elite 3.5L V6,2016

I was driving my car in the normal mode (acc and lkas disabled) on a normal two lane paved road when the car in front of me made a slow right turn. I was not following very closely and came to a complete stop on my own to avoid running into the other car. I stopped about 15 feet away from the other car. The other car then completed the turn to the extent that the other car was no longer in the way of me driving forward in a straight line. When I pushed the gas to then proceed the collision mitigation system started flashing the ""brake"" message and producing an audible warning. At this point I was possibly going 10 mph again. After verifying that there was definitely not anything in my way, I kept applying the gas. My car then started braking on its own, at which point I pushed the gas harder to presumably over-ride the braking. A moment or two later, my car then made a sudden and hard brake on its own that brought my car to a complete stop, despite the fact that I was pushing hard on the gas. The other car that had turned was well clear of the lane by this point, and was easily 1 ft away from my path of travel when I started accelerating in the first place. My only explanation is that the collision mitigation system was confused by the lack of a shoulder lane marker (only a raise cement curb was present) and somehow thought the car was still in the ""road."" In either case, the system malfunctioned to the point that my car was suddenly brought to a complete stop, and the car behind me very nearly rear-ended me in a situation where I had already come to a stop, and the obstacle in front of me had cleared / continued to become increasingly more clear of my path.

Collision mitigation: - all of these trigger ""brake"" messages to be displayed, which is just 1 step before the brakes being auto-applied, which could cause me to be rear-ended. - false alarms while merging from lefthand onramps where a pending collision with the jersey barrier is detected - false alarms by the hills adjacent to the road when going around a sharp turn on back roads - false alarms when cresting a hill with a curve after the hill and it thinks an oncoming car will be hit, because it can't see the lane markings past the hill lane keep assist: - partially goes into exit ramps on its own if in the right lane, causing other drivers to think I am leaving the lane and start to merge themselves - is confused by lines of tar and will depart the lane on its own - often ""fights"" with the lane departure mitigation around corners - tries to prevent me from giving other vehicles some buffer when passing them, if they are wider or drifting toward me. - does not alert when it stops being able to detect the lines-Gaithersburg, MD, USA",Pilot,2015

There was no engine power but luckily I was able to coast the vehicle to a nearby parking lot. The dealer indicated there was no problem, just a computer glitch, and the only repair necessary was to reset the computer/software. The second incident occurred last week, only this time while driving on the freeway. We completely lost all engine power but luckily I was in the right lane and I was able to coast to the side and pull over on the shoulder. If I had been in the fast or middle lane with little opportunity to move over, there could have been a serious collision. Similar to the first incident, we were unable to start the car with the warning lights showing various system failures. We had the car towed to the same dealer who initially indicated they would just reboot the software again. So we pressed upon them to do a more thorough diagnosis since this is the second time its happened. They agreed to keep the vehicle and seek to identify the root cause of the problem.

2016,engine,no_oil_pan,D.Chandler,USA,Mar 01,honda,pilot,2016.0,"Automatic transmission-4,029 miles","It's probably a design problem for the engineers to fix and Honda should come out with a procedure/policy to remedy the problem.I have a 2016 Honda Pilot and had my first oil changed when I took it in to the dealership to fix the recall on the odometer. When I got the Pilot back I parked it in my garage. I did an errand and parked it back in my garage. Later, I discovered two oil spots, one large and one small in my garage. I called San Tan Honda and they scheduled an appointment the very next day. They said it is residual oil that landed on the sub frame during the oil change and that the oil filter was intact. The service adviser told me the mechanic cleaned the sub frame of the residual oil. I brought the pilot back home, parked it in my driveway so I could clean the oil spots in my garage. When I moved the pilot back in the garage, I discovered oil spots in my driveway (post cleaning by the mechanic). I called that in to San Tan Honda and they were kind enough to offer to send a cleaning unit to clean my driveway....I told them I already clean the oil stain. Kudos to San Tan Honda (Auto Nation Honda Chandler) for going over and beyond in customer service.Here's the problem, the engineers placed the oil filter right above the right front sub frame of the 2016 Pilot. There's no room to put a the drip pan to catch the oil that leads into the barrel. If the oil filter tilts a little upon removal or falls over you can have up to a 1/2 cup of oil spill unto the sub frame. No amount of cleaning short of steam cleaning the sub frame will removed the spilled oil. I hand only one oil changed and already my sub frame on the right front is greased up due to the spilled oil.There's four solutions:
l) after an oil changed, parked your 2016 Honda on the street for a month or buy a large drip pan for your garage.
2) Have Honda engineers redesigned the engine so there's nothing directly under the oil filter so that the mechanic can placed the drip pan directly under the filter to catch the old filter and any residual oil.
3) Come up with a policy/procedures for the Honda mechanics to follow to redirect the residual oil into the drip pan....such as: have a piece of sheet metal (12"" by 18"") with a center crease placed under the oil filter that is about to be removed, with the lower end of the sheet metal placed above the drip pan. That way the oil filter and any residual oil would still drip into the drip pan and not the the sub frame. 
4) Do your oil change yourself and put more care about channeling the residual oil into a drip pan then the mechanic....keeping the sub frame from getting all greased up.Let me make a note that Auto Nation Honda Chandler was very accommodating and this design flaw is by no way reflect on their ability to remedy the situation.","Pilot Elite 3.2L, V6",2016

2024,engine,auto_idle_stop_does_not_work,PA,USA,Nov 03,honda,pilot,2016.0,Automatic transmission-333 miles,"Well, I decided to purchase a new 2016 Honda Touring Pilot from a local dealer. I have been reading an awful lot of complaints on this new vehicle from Piloteers.org. I have to say that I am not experiencing all the same complaints, however, at this point, only one. My Auto Idle Stop feature does not work or it works intermittently. Jury is still out on that issue. I received the SUV with 12 miles on her. I started to realize soon after that my Auto Stop Idle was not working. It did work a few times, etc... This was probably around 250 miles. I took Suv to dealer at 333 miles on her, where they sat me down and explained that a lot of certain conditions need to be met for it to work. I replied,that I read the manual and CD. I met all those requirements. ""It still does not work."" Actually, I just looked at what the service tech wrote in her comments and don't agree at all. She wrote ""C/S Stop Idle is Inop. Please advise. Customer spoke with Scott-will leave his last name omitted and went over stop Idle operation. No corrective action to be made. Working as described."" How can she say, it is working as described? Scott indicated that he didn't know why it isn't working. He went on to tell me that unless the icon flashes and throws a code, they can't do anything. I understand that logic, however, it isn't working and it isn't throwing any codes to the computer. What do I have to do to get this to work? It should work every time I have the system on and ready. Seat belt on, defroster off, all engine temps normal because of driving the SUV, system on and ready, no flashing icon. What do they want, screaming kids in the back seat bouncing all around to get this system to work? Bottom line is that it does not work and I somewhat felt blown off at my dealer. I realize that the SUV is brand new. I don't know what to do. I paid over 46k and feel all advertised systems should work 100% of the time. Thank you.Update from Nov 7, 2015:This is an update to my original issue with the Auto Idle Stop. After I wrote the complaint the other morning, you will never guess what happen to work the next day? Yup the Auto Idle Stop. I had exactly 415 miles on vehicle. The only thing I did that was different was a few days prior I went in to the settings on my 8"" screen. Vehicle-meter, turn on and off the Auto Idle Stop. I turned it on and off a few times, so you could see it on the MID. Has nothing to do with the manual button you press on the center shifter. I leave that on all the time. Besides it defaults to on every time the car is started. It was raining out and for a second I thought that maybe, I am experiencing a condensation issue with the system. I don't know... I plan on monitoring this. I realize that certain conditions need to be met for it to operate. I meet all the conditions everyday I drive the vehicle. You turn it on, it should operate, you shut off, it doesn't. I think it is possibly a software related problem. I recently was made aware from these great web sites that a recall is under way for a ""software update odometer issue"" on the Pilot. I wonder if this is somehow related as well? Jury is out on that one too. Will keep the site posted.. All I know now is that it works..................... If anyone else is experiencing these issues please report it here and on Piloteers.org. Honda sure as hell isn't going to call us and say. Hey we screwed up on the Pilot. They will only do this if they have too. Thank you...Update from Nov 11, 2015:Stopped working again at 525 miles, etc...",Pilot Touring 3.5L V6,2015

It sounded like a gun shot in my right ear, then glass began to fall on my head and throughout the car - I'm sure the majority of it was sucked out and onto the interstate. (I had the sun shade inside opened so my child could watch the rain on the ride to the babysitters.)I found others with the same problem when I googled it. Car was towed to dealership and issue would be covered under warranty I was told, I was given a loaner while it was fixed. No other vehicles in front of or behind me within 4 car lengths at least. I did not pass under an overpass. It was raining that day (of course - that's my luck) when I got to work I closed the sun shade on the inside as best as I could with all the glass that was in the track, and taped garbage bags over it to preserve the inside. I went to dealership later to take additional pictures and you can tell the glass was blow outwards. There was even chips in the paint through the clear coat from when glass flew. I'm thankful I was the only one in the car at the time, but my child's car seat is full of glass remains. I wasn't hurt - only a few cuts from glass that was in my jacket pocket and in my clothes. I am still at a loss as to what happened, how and why - unknown. And so far the dealership has not communicated anything to me, but I hope they make it right.-Charlotte, NC, USA",Santa Fe,2016

Now, the system is supposed to activate when it senses a vehicle IN FRONT OF it so that it can maintain a safe distance behind it. However, this happened when a person was jogging on the sidewalk next to me (and I promise that I was not driving on the sidewalk at this poor person), when a bus next to me slowed around a corner, and when two vehicles turned right in the right turn lane while I progressed in the right straight lane. I was almost rear ended on two of these occasions because of how abrupt the braking is. Moreover, when an animal ran out in front of me, the system did not activate and I nearly collided with it. It renders the system not only completely useless, but a huge danger and liability. When I took it to the dealership, they told me ""this is normal"" and that the system is ""too sophisticated for its own good"".

Mainly notice it when taking a corner. It seems as if it has trouble selecting the gear and once it does, it lurches forward. Dangerous when pulling out into traffic as the hesitation puts you in the middle of the road just a little too long for comfort. Also, my traction control light will come on around certain corners and leaves me without control of the car. Also another safety issue as again the car hesitates or locks up because of this feature and doesn't allow me to drive forward as I wish. It's the middle of the summer without any rain and definitely no snow on the ground (I'd say perfect road conditions) so no real reason why my traction control should be turning on around corners.

No visible engine light or fault code was triggered. Less severe problem: On a regular basis, the vehicle suffers abrupt and sustained loss of power in merging situations (especially when turning on city streets from a stop).

2142,engine,loss_of_power_during_acceleration,F.Woodland,US,Apr 01,hyundai,santa_fe,2017.0,"Automatic transmission-1,500 miles","Purchased the car new from the dealer. The engine and safety issues can make this car somewhat dangerous to drive.ISSUES:
- From a complete stop and then turning right uphill, the car stalls/hesitates during acceleration, can come to a complete stop and can even start rolling backwards during acceleration uphill. Specifically, when turning right and accelerating uphill, the traction control switches on automatically, which can cause a complete loss of torque and also pushes RPM's to well over 6000 while the car is attempting to shift from first to second gear. This creates a dangerous stall situation and also causes the steering and handling to become unpredictable. This could lead to a potentially dangerous safety condition of the car rolling back into another car or over-steering into traffic/curb.- The ""Eco Mode"" is dangerous. The steering is much too loose during this mode and can lead to over-steering while driving at higher speeds. I've tested this mode extensively and there also appears to be absolutely no fuel savings between it and the standard driving mode. This mode can also cause a complete loss of torque/acceleration and creates a stall/hesitation during acceleration from a stop while trying to enter and merge onto freeways. Avoid ever using this mode as it is definitely not worth the risk and is not saving much if any fuel. The Hyundai manual claims the car has ""260 ft lbs of torque"", but this may be an inaccurate claim.- Did not realize that the collision avoidance systems and automatic braking are not standard on the premium trim package for the Ultimate. They are only standard the ""Ultimate Tech Package"". These features are prominently displayed on the Hyundai USA website, but are not featured with the premium package. These safety systems are going to be standard on all new vehicles starting in 2022. Why they did not include these as standard safety features with their premium package is beyond me. Hyundai also indicates that they do not offer a standard safety features upgrade with the premium package, as it is only sold with the ""Ultimate Tech Package"".POSSIBLE SOLUTION?
- One solution may be to reprogram the computer, so when the car is started, the default is ""Sport"" mode with traction control turned off. Also, the gear ratio from first to second gear is too high/wide and needs to be set to start shifting at around 4-5000 RPMs from a stop during acceleration (as it should not be going over 6000 RPMs while attempting to shift from 1st to 2nd gear).CONCLUSION
Overall, I really like the premium features this car offers (panoramic sunroof, push-button start, auto lift-gate, overall driving comfort, etc.), however I'm very disappointed and concerned with this car overall and I feel that Hyundai has not been very receptive to my concerns. I'm taking it to back to the dealer to see if any of these issues can be worked out.

The new 2017 Santa Fe has something wrong with its transmission control system.Update from Apr 16, 2017:Think I may have a handle on the lack of acceleration problem.  It appears that when accelerating from stop, if you drive through a pot hole (it's Spring in Canada so not too hard to find one) the tiny bit of wheel spin triggers the traction control system.  This in turn takes 4-6 seconds to decide to turn itself off.  While doing this, you have very little acceleration capability.  Its quite dangerous in my opinion as you might be pulling into traffic.  I tested this theory at my favourite pot hole outside of work by disengaging the traction control and viola! No problem.

I drove the car home, about 5 minutes from the dealership. All seemed well. The next day, I went on a road trip from Kennesaw to Savannah, GA, which is about 300 miles. The car drove mostly okay. While driving 55+ on the highway, I noticed constantly having to correct the steering wheel as the car wanted to veer left or right. It wasn't horrible just yet. I arrived late night in Savannah, very excited about my new car. It was a fun drive aside from the odd steering that wouldn't stay straight. I parked the car at my mother's house (who lives in Savannah). Savannah is a walking town, so NO need for the car while I was there. I did not drive the car again until Sunday, March 20, when I returned to Atlanta. The first 20 minutes of the trip was about like the drive down from Atlanta. I had to keep the steering wheel in check. VERY ANNOYING. But soon, it started feeling worse, more drastic pulling. I felt like the wind was blowing me around, but it wasn't that at all. Tire pressure was about the same as it was coming down. I checked that several times. I did notice driving down it was 51 psi. Then when I started the trip back, I saw 48psi save one tired at 49psi. Odd. Then 15-20 minutes later into the trip, it was back up to 50 psi on all 4 tires. Odd. Either way, I stayed around 60-65 mph speed limit because the swerving was getting scary. I did about 75-80 on the trip down to Savannah, and about that starting back until the swaying/swerving got worse. I had my 8 month old baby daughter in the car, so I was stressed the entire 5 hour trip back home, paranoid I would lose control. I was emotionally drained when I got home. I was distraught and depressed after realizing I just bought a gigantic LEMON! And I hardly expect the dealership to do a thing! This has all just happened, so we will see how HYUNDAI OF KENNESAW decides to HANDLE this one. I will go in person later today to see if they will do anything to make this right.Update from Mar 30, 2016:The dealership has been working with me beatifully on this. Too bad the Hyundai brand steering is so strange. The swerving issue has not recurred; but the car cannot maintain a straight line without constant correction of the wheel.

2173,accessories-interior,seats,AZ,USA,Jul 04,hyundai,santa_fe,2017.0,"2,700 miles","In the affected vehicle, the wires in the can wiring harness assembly and airbag wiring harness assembly may be damaged by the passenger seat's height adjuster mechanism. A metal 3rd party power inverter was positioned underneath the passenger seat. Prior seat adjustments caused the sheath around the harnesses to become bare, exposing the electrical wiring. The metal power inverter become lodged against the wiring causing a short in the wiring and causing the entire vehicle's electrical system to fail. The epb (electronic parking break) became engaged and it was impossible to drive the vehicle. Although acknowledge that the 3rd party power inverter was under the seat, the vehicle had been driven 4 times with it under it, totaling less than 800 miles. It is not known how long it would take for that box to rub against the sheath on the harness and bare the wiring, therefore it is suspected that the power seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare and that recall #141 safety campaign #16V145000 may not have been properly resolved. We believe the seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare, prior to the inverter being placed under the seat. The inverter was positioned such that it wasn't making contact with the bare wire, until the seat was adjusted on 7/2/2017. The car was not driven on 7/3/2016. The incident occurred on 7/4/216 as the vehicle was driven across railroad tracks. It is believed the inverter was then jarred against the bare wire, causing the short. The dealership has not validated this; they are suggesting it was the inverter that caused the wires to become bare. Our opinion is that the inverter was not there long enough to cause that wiring to become bare. It wasn't until I discovered this previous recall that everything started to make sense. It is a $5,300 repair because the other wires involved that are bare are for the airbags.-Phoenix, AZ, USA",Santa Fe,2016

It became progressively worse (especially turning corners and when the vehicle had not been used for a longer period - like overnight) so I had booked a test drive with a technician who was able to replicate the hesitation. I competed the first service on the vehicle early (5736 klms) so they could look at the hesitation issue at the same time they did the service. They said there was no mechanical issue but said the safety feature with the vehicle ie: when the vehicle felt like it would lose traction, the power would be reduced. I said this was a safety issue but mine not the vehicle! When I need power, I need power to get me out of a situation which may cause an accident!

I've done a little investigating and found that the hesitation is from the car down shifting from 3rd gear to 2nd gear. Now most cars when down shifting will have a very slight interruption in acceleration in some cars you might not even notice but the hesitation in the 2017 Santa Fe is so abrupt that it moves your whole body back and forward. This hesitation can also be dangerous, I approached an intersection and slowed down to between 10 and 15 mph and then tried to accelerate through the intersection the car down shifted from 3rd gear to 2nd gear as it should but the down shift took too long and left me in the intersection for a second or two longer than I should have been making the cars coming from the opposite direction dangerously close. I called the dealership at 200 miles and told them about this problem they told me to continue driving the car because the computer in the car is learning how you drive. I continued to drive the car and at 1000 miles it still had the hesitation so I brought it into the hyundai dealership.

When we got back to the dealership he said no code lights came on so there wasn't much he could do so he reset the computer and told me to continue to drive the car.

His response was that this was the way the the car was designed and it seems like I just don't like the way the car shifts and since no code lights came on there wasn't much he could do. I am extremely mad you would think that a car that has a sticker price between 42,000---44,000 dollars would have a flawless transmission cars costing thousands of dollars less have a smoother transmission. Now there is a lot that I like about the 2017 Sante Fe so I'm hoping that this hesitation resolves itself on its own as the car continues to break in or hopefully Hyundai sends out a computer update that fixes the problem I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this issue and I have considered taking a loss and trading the Sante Fe in for a Honda pilot. In the meantime for my safety and the safety of others I really have to watch driving through intersection between 10 and 15 mph.",Santa Fe Limited Ultimate 3.3 Liter,2016
