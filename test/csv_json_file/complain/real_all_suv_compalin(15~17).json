If the vehicle ahead does not move forward within two seconds (unlikely in heavy traffic) the acc displays a message in the dash warning the driver to press the brake and then suddenly shuts off the acc and releases the brake causing the car to being to creep forward. My car came close to rolling into the car in front because the first time I used the acc I did not expect this behavior. The acc is promoted as having a stop and go feature. I expected the acc to wait until the car I was behind to resume speed and then resume speed for my car accordingly. (this is the way I was used to this feature working in my Mercedes S550). There is a sophisticated center dash computer system showing climate, radio, nav, etc. I was exploring this system and not watching the driver information display in the dash and as such, missed the very brief message warning me to apply the brake. Besides the fact that in essence this car does not really employ a stop and go feature for all practical purposes and lulls a new driver into a false sense of security, the current implementation makes no sense from a safety standpoint. The driver should not have to do anything for the car to resume following the car in front. A less desirable, but better implementation would be to require some driver input to the car to resume travel - but this certainly would not qualify as a stop and go acc.-Bozeman, MT, USA","25":"The contact owns a 2015 Dodge Durango.

This has been an issue from the day we drove it off the lot, and only really paid attention to it when the outside temperature dropped and the heat was turned on. I can only describe it as a \u201cmaple syrup like\u201d toxic smell from vents only when the heater is on. The dealership told me the manufacturer is aware of a \u201csmell\u201d issue and does not have a cause or solution. The vehicle doesn\u2019t appear to be leaking antifreeze.The first visit, the dealer flushed the coolant twice and a line was replaced, item # 68189075AE (Hose Purge). The odor was just a pungent afterwards. The dealer flushed the coolant again and told me the smell is not as noticeable. They will be keeping it an extra day to check for critters (Not sure how rotten flesh could be confused with maple syrup).I am suspecting a heater core issue, bad rubber or bad plastics, but it really doesn\u2019t matter what the problem is, I need the smell eliminated. I certainly do not want my kids in this vehicle breathing in the toxic air.Both loaner cars they provided had absolutely no heater smells.","48":"Loved this car but its too bad chrysler has horrible fiat class customer service and does not care about customers. I have read dozens of complaints about chryslers service and totally agree. $50,000 durango was brand new and all of a sudden heard a boom and said a message about transmission failure and to stop vehicle. Tried pulling over but could not make it. Looked under car and it was leaking transmission fluid everywhere. Tried having people help push car to side of road and of course because of the stupid rotary dial transmission shifter could not even shift into neutral. Caused a huge traffic jam and left us stranded. EXTREMELY pissed at this point, called chryslers roadside assistance and of course they claim we were in a remote area and they did not tow then. Had to pay out of pocket to have car flatbed towed. Then car sat at dealer for 5 days while chrysler took their time to approve the repair. Horrible. This was 2 years ago and we have not had the problem since but I will not a buy another fiat I should say. This is not who chrysler is, I have owned them all through my life and have not had a problem until this. Car also rattles and squeaks inside. Does not drive like a $50,000 car. Disappointed.","49":"My car has been in the shop for over a month. And the only thing dodge can tell me is the part is on back order. This car is a 2015, it should not take months for no parts.

If the vehicle ahead does not move forward within two seconds (unlikely in heavy traffic) the acc displays a message in the dash warning the driver to press the brake and then suddenly shuts off the acc and releases the brake causing the car to being to creep forward. My car came close to rolling into the car in front because the first time I used the acc I did not expect this behavior. The acc is promoted as having a stop and go feature. I expected the acc to wait until the car I was behind to resume speed and then resume speed for my car accordingly. (this is the way I was used to this feature working in my Mercedes S550). There is a sophisticated center dash computer system showing climate, radio, nav, etc. I was exploring this system and not watching the driver information display in the dash and as such, missed the very brief message warning me to apply the brake. Besides the fact that in essence this car does not really employ a stop and go feature for all practical purposes and lulls a new driver into a false sense of security, the current implementation makes no sense from a safety standpoint. The driver should not have to do anything for the car to resume following the car in front. A less desirable, but better implementation would be to require some driver input to the car to resume travel - but this certainly would not qualify as a stop and go acc.-Bozeman, MT, USA","59":"I'm so disappointed with Dodge :( I previously owned a Dodge Nitro 2011 and ever since i bought it it gave me problems, started with the engine light then power steering. i had to be taking it back and forth to Dodge dealer about 5 times with in one year. i finally decided to get rid of it and buy a new 2015 Dodge Durango, well let me tell you. I'm starting to regret it. It hasn't been a year and my check engine just came out as well as a powertrain malfunction. I will be taking it to the dealer this weekend to try to figure out what the problem is. ugh so annoyed.

Few days back I was driving from another city to my home with my family and on the way my Durango engine stops without warning lights. I was not able to restart for few min. Then it starts and I went to agency directly to discuss this issue. They told me come tomorrow and they will look at it. Next day service representative took my car and informed me it will take 3 days for investigation. I got my car back after 3 days and not sure what service agency did. They said nothing wrong with the car.Today same breakdown happened on the way. I was driving in the local and suddenly car engine stops without warning and I am even not able to restart it again. I park on the side and it was too much traffic. After several tries to start, I succeed to start it and it happened again after few times.

Sometimes that's it when I put it in drive and I park.","63":"I purchased a New 2015 Dodge Dart from Landmark Dealers in Morrow, Ga(Atlanta) Jan. 18th, 2015. Received E-mailed notification from Landmark Service dept Feb. 16th informing me that the first service check was coming up soon and to call for appointment. I contacted Landmark, Morrow, Ga to see if I could have it serviced at the Local Dodge Dealership in Columbus Ga and the answer was Yes...any Chrysler, RAM, Fiat, Dodge Dealership will be fine.I took the vehicle in for service on March 6, 2015 approx. around noon and picked it up when it was ready that afternoon between 4 & 5pm. My partner (who is also financed on the lease of the car) drove the vehicle to Missouri in tow with three other family members to help pack and relocate ailing grandmother to another state (Texas). The vehicle stalled on N.Belt Hwy in St. Joseph Missouri. The oil light lit up and instantly the car stalled in mid-operation.Once she driver drifted as far as she could off the road, the car began to smoke. She as well as the other passengers began to grab the luggage in fear that the vehicle was going to catch on fire due to the horrific smell. The local fire dept and Police arrived at the scene. I received the frantic call from her and I called Roadside assistance and requested for them to contact her for the location to surrender help. Roadside assistance towed the vehicle to the nearest dealership (Car City Chrysler in St. Joseph Missouri).After a 3 to 4 hour wait for the mechanic to diagnose the problem, the Mechanic specifically explained that when he removed the Drain Mast from underneath the Dodge Dart, the oil plug was detached. The oil plug was sitting right on top and that the person who did the oil change improperly re-installed the oil plug and in all, the oil plug worked itself out completely by it being loose. After I was told the BAD news, I immediately went to the Dodge dealership in Columbus Ga to discuss this issue with them and to see if they could assist in anyway to help my partner and family get back to Columbus Ga since they were stranded with NO transportation AND in an unfamiliar state over 855 miles away!Dodge Dealership offered no assistance and instead is trying to deny their workmanship error. My partner surrendered the cash on hand she had for purchases of two airline tickets for two of the family member passengers because they had to be at work the very next morning. I had to wire funds to my partner in order for her and the sister to rent a vehicle back to Columbus Ga the next day.Carl Gregory Dodge filed a claim on their insurance and I was told from today 3\/31\/15, there will be another 48 to 72 hrs to wait on an adjustor to visit the dealership in Missouri. In the meantime, I have no transportation and certainly is not prepared to come out of pocket again to spill out money for another rental!! Dodge is questioning the timing of the oil plug falling out. I'm pretty sure the vibration of the long trip help the loose plug detach fully. It would have happened here in Columbus Ga eventually but the car was not driven a long period of time on any one trip. I work 10 to 15 minutes...by the time the engine starts to get hot, I'm shutting it down in the parking lot at my job or at the house after I get off. Running errors here in there on an off day was the same way.Whatever the verdict is with the insurance company, I will never deal with Dodge Dealership again! The value of the car is very much diminished and it is no use for me anymore besides, why would I want to continue dealing with Dodge if there is no trust in their workmanship or support in a situation like this!!!!! I would rather be compensated for my brand new 2015 Dodge Dart so that I can go to another dealership.....NOT DODGE!!!!!......STAY AWAY!!!!!!.....and purchase me another vehicle that I can count on!!","64":"No accident happened yet but I believe one will. This car is equipped with a rotarty transmission selector for drive by wire transmission and has an auto engine stop start feature. This start stop feature can be disabled after the vehicle is started, but cannot be set by default to disable this feature. I understand the fuel saving issue, however but many of us have been driving for many years and we do a lot of things unconsciously because these activities are so common to us. When this feature is activated and you come into your drive way, your garage or a parking space and fully come to a stop, the engine turns off and all goes quiet. Subconsciously because of a lifetime of driving experience, you think the car is off, your travel is over and you are ready to exit the vehicle. You start to open the door and release the brake pedal and the vehicle immediately restarts and moves forward. If a child or someone else or a building wall is it front of the vehicle, a serious accident could happen. Please rethink this. It is not an intuitive process when we have years or decades of a different driving experience. We think the car is off, safe to exit. We need a way to default disable this feature rather than default enable. I know there is an investigation regarding death or injury with regard to the transmission on these vehicles, specifically a claim that vehicle could move with selector put in the park position. I wonder how many accidents were result of drivers thinking the vehicle was off and then it moved. It may be embarrassing and not be admitted to.-Chandler, AZ, USA","65":"I had a 2014 Durango and it had a wind whistle at highway speed when there was a cross wind or strong head wind. Dealer couldn't figure it out. We took a new Durango from the lot for a drive and it whistled just like mine. I told the dealer there should be a bulletin on it if two of them both whistled. They found out that it was where the washer fluid hose goes over the weather stripping in front of the fire wall. The fix was to move the hose from the built in clip on the underside of the hood to a new location about two inches down to a round hole in the hood. I think it is a drain hole for between the two layers of the hood. They put a loose or floating clip in there to hold the hose. It fixed the problem unless there was a really strong wind and the there was usually a noise coming from somewhere else anyway. The part that is very stupid is that my 2017 is designed exactly the same wayand has the same whistle..You would think the geniuses at Chrysler would have figured It out by now and had a new design for it. Need to get a proper clip for this one to fix the problem. Had lots of other problems with the 2014 but still loved the vehicle so bought another one..

Have been told Ford's engineering rep (during Ford's \"final repair attempt\" under lemon law) also smelled fumes in cabin under wot and when engine under load. Was told that it could not be carbon monoxide in cabin making me dizzy and sick feeling because \"catalytic converter changes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, which is why dealer uses CO2 meter not co meter\". was informed that regional engineer instructed dealer to repeat tsb 14-0130 even though they were then telling me that the smell is from \"mildew on the A\/C evaporator core\", which contradicts their performing the tsb to seal the vehicle from exhaust fumes a second time (performed previously without effect in 10\/2015). Have been told many different \"reasons\" for the fumes in cabin, none of which make much sense. Mildew does not smell like sulfur or exhaust fumes. To make things worse, I was told that I \"do not drive enough miles\" during my trips to \"dry out the evaporator core\" so I am told my driving habits, not Ford's design flaws allowing exhaust into cabin, are the reason for the fumes. Service manager has been diligent and professional and is a genuinely nice person, though Ford is trying to serve up a \"red herring\" by trying to divert attention to the A\/C system rather than admit to exhaust fumes in passenger cabin.

Probably cause by the fact the etanol gas is not compatible with this twin turbo set up. Not to mention the transmission leaks as well as the bottom side of the throttle body. I love Ford (american made). But as an american I feel that they felled me. Breaks my heart. Anyone know where to buy a good Chevy from.-Dallas, GA, USA","95":"When accelerate quickly exhaust fumes enter into cabin of vehicle.-Quitman, LA, USA","96":"Exhaust fumes are entering the passenger cabin of the vehicle while driving. The exhaust is most noticeable during acceleration at highway speeds. I have taken the Explorer to the dealer twice where it is still at since Oct 5th, today is Nov 4th. The Ford dealer has performed a tsb to correct the known issue of exhaust entering the passenger cabin. This fix did not correct the problem or lessen it to any degree.

After refueling I was unable to remove the fuel nozzle from my vehicle. I moved it around, pushed, and pulled on the nozzle to no avail.the vehicle was obviously stationary at this time. After about fifteen minutes and with the help of other people I was unable to get the nozzle out of my vehicle. I told the gas station attendant who was able to push and pull the nozzle enough to get it dislodged from my vehicle. I took the vehicle to the dealer I bought it from auto nation frisco, Texas. My vehicle had less than five thousand miles on it at the time of the incident. The dealer refused to replace the capless fuel system component saying it was not broke it was a gas station issue- faulty fuel nozzle?? I spoke to the service manager who refused to replace the component. I wrote a letter to the GM of the dealership as well as the vp of customer service for auto nation explaining the problem and asking to be contacted. As of this writing I have had no response. I filled a complaint with Ford Motor Co. Case# 7943196. On 10-8-2015 I was advised that the case was closed. I was never able to talk to them so I left a voice mail and sent a E-mail asking to be contacted. As of this writing I have had no response. I was told by the dealer after the incident that there was a bulletin explaining what nozzles to avoid. Seems like good information to have prior to an incident not after!! I believe this to be a real problem and do not feel comfortable using my vehicle until the component is replaced. Having to pull, push, and pry to get a fuel nozzle out of your vehicle sure seems like a obvious safety issue. The car dealer and Ford Motor Co. Says its not their problem. The gas station attendant said it was a Ford problem. Consumer stuck in the middle!!-Mckinney, TX, USA","98":"During acceleration (getting on highway, passing, etc.) the cab fills with exhaust smell.

This morning, my wife planned to go to the store. She entered the vehicle, started it, put it in reverse, and proceeded to back out of the parking spot. As usual, she applied the brakes to stop the car and put it in drive, but unfortunately, this morning the brakes did not respond. She applied the brakes a few more times to no avail. After that did not work, she applied the emergency brake, which did not do anything either. Finally, she turned off the engine and put the car in park, which didn't do anything either. She ended up doing a U-turn in reverse. My other truck was parked to the right of where the Ford Explorer was parked, so once the Ford Explorer reached my parked truck and collided with it, the Ford Explorer finally stopped.

We have attached a photo of the Ford Explorer collided onto my parked truck (a Ford F150), which it had to do in order to stop and not collide into anything or anyone else.

After smelling this, I did some research and found other Ford Explorer owners with the same complaint and the smell was accompanied with carbon monxide. 9-28-15 dealership sealed rear underbody. 5-2-16 dealership installed new downturned muffler assembly. After this fix the smell went from a few seconds to a minute plus. Caused watering eyes, headache and coughing. 7-26-2016 dealership replaced the muffler system that had \"bad welds\", and reprogrammed electronic modules. Sept. 3, 2016 left on a trip, and the smell came back while paasssing on the freeway. Also on a trip, the burnt hair smell came into the vehicle through second row, passengers, lowered window. The smell appeared again while going up a hill on freeway, this time through the drivers lowered window. Watering eye, headaches and coughing accompanied the odor. 10-3-2016 dealership resealed all of the back of the vehicle and improved tailgate gasket. District engineer did an onsite inspection. 11-30-2016 picked the repaired vehicle up. 12-4-2016 exhaust fumes again while accelerating up freeway on ramp. 12-9-2016 Ford denied a buy back claim.

Although the smell was there from the beginning it was progressively getting worse. It seems to happen whenever it feels like it. It occurs with the A\/C off, while driving at a steady speed, and upon acceleration. I have taken it to brandon Ford for several attempts to fix the problem, which they had no idea it even existed. After several attempts to fix the exhaust\/carbon monoxide Ford is telling me they have a report that a field engineer has deemed the fumes\/poison entering the cab \"a normal occurrence\" and they will no longer put it in service.-Lithia, FL, USA","152":"No engine acceleration the truck failed to accelerate when entering highway ca 92 West bound.

The only way to clear the dangerous exhaust gases is to open windows allowing for a change in the cabin's atmosphere. This is a recurring issue that can be replicated. Working with the dealership we purchased from as well as Ford corporate to resolve this dangerous situation. Many units are experiencing this same issue. No proven repair \/ fix to date.

Total days at dealer for service due to exhaust fumes \/ chemical smell in passenger compartment: 26 as of 10\/16\/16. Have been told Ford's engineering rep (during Ford's \"final repair attempt\" under lemon law) also smelled fumes in cabin under wot and when engine under load. Was told that it could not be carbon monoxide in cabin making me dizzy and sick feeling because \"catalytic converter changes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, which is why dealer uses CO2 meter not co meter\". was informed that regional engineer instructed dealer to repeat tsb 14-0130 even though they were then telling me that the smell is from \"mildew on the A\/C evaporator core\", which contradicts their performing the tsb to seal the vehicle from exhaust fumes a second time (performed previously without effect in 10\/2015). Have been told many different \"reasons\" for the fumes in cabin, none of which make much sense. Mildew does not smell like sulfur or exhaust fumes. To make things worse, I was told that I \"do not drive enough miles\" during my trips to \"dry out the evaporator core\" so I am told my driving habits, not Ford's design flaws allowing exhaust into cabin, are the reason for the fumes. Service manager has been diligent and professional and is a genuinely nice person, though Ford is trying to serve up a \"red herring\" by trying to divert attention to the A\/C system rather than admit to exhaust fumes in passenger cabin. Ford replaced the evap core which resulted in nearly no A\/C upon being told vehicle ready for pick-up on 10\/15\/16, so it is still in service..now to repair what they broke during \"final repair attempt\". to consumer, appears Ford has propped open fresh air vents regardless of \"recirculate\" button light, resulting in warm A\/C. Ford should re-purchase this hazardous vehicle.-Land O Lakes, FL, USA","156":"Smell of exhaust fumes and\/or sulfur-type odors coming through air conditioning system under heavy acceleration, passing on highway, or when engine is under a load. Fumes\/smell get so bad that I have to roll down all windows and open sunroof to ventilate the passenger compartment. Tolerated the headaches, nausea, and light-headedness while driving until situation became intolerable and had begun to avoid driving the Explorer. First serviced in 10\/2015, dealer had vehicle for 4 or 5 days. I was told that a tsb was performed which included removing the rear bumper and using sealant, but that did not correct the problem. Fumes in passenger compartment persisted. On 9\/26\/2016 took vehicle back to dealer for further diagnostics and repair attempts for same problem. Dealer had vehicle through 10\/4\/16, and called to tell me to come pick-up vehicle as it was \"fixed\" by cleaning A\/C evaporator, and also \"speaking with Ford engineers\". went for test drive with service manager. After approx. 4-5 miles on highway, under varying acceleration conditions, cabin began to smell like fumes again, coming through the A\/C vents. Then I began to feel light-headed and informed service manager of same. Could not ventillate vehicle due to heavy rains, but taking A\/C off of \"recirculate air\" helped only a little, and changed nature of odor slightly. Dealership was using a meter to measure what was supposed to be carbon monoxide. Was consistently told throughout that measurements were \"low\" at 900ppm to max 1500ppm. When driving with same meter, it alarmed multiple times, but I was told it was because meter responds to breathing in the car. I determined that meter was for carbon dioxide not carbon monoxide. Returned vehicle to service, was told Ford is having regional rep examine vehicle on 10\/11\/16. I have filed a lemon law complaint with BBB.-Land O Lakes, FL, USA","157":"Upon hard acceleration, such as trying to get on the interstate highway or going up a hill while pulling a trailer, exhaust fumes are getting into the passenger cabin. You can smell an odor similar to sulfur or like someone struck a kitchen match. This is most noticeable when the front and rear ac units are running. I've taken the vehicle to the dealership twice and the tsb repairs have been done on the vehicle but the fumes are still getting into the cabin. The last time I had it in to the dealer, I had one of the mechanics ride with me while I got on the interstate. He never would say that he smelled the odor of the exhaust but if I could smell it, he certainly could have as well. The odor is offensive and bothersome but the carbon monoxide that it contains is poisonous. I've looked online and there are many post to various websites posted by owners that have the same problem.

When I picker up the vehicle my receipt stated \"could not verify problem\", (that is a major cover-up) by the dealer from liability. I filed complaint with Ford and took it to another dealership. They verified the problem and have had it twice more and replaced the exhaust and resealed the body seams but the smell is still there. I have been in contact with Ford but keep getting the run around and told I have to take it back to the dealer but the dealer tells me they have done everything to try and fix it. My main complaint is that this is a lease vehicle so it belongs to Ford, they should just take their vehicle back and release me from my lease since they cannot fix their vehicle. Ford tells me that they filed the paperwork for the lemon law but I need to take it back to the dealer again and again.

The outward visibility from the driver's seat for the front and rear of this vehicle is severely compromised by the huge C pillars which create blind spots within the vehicle. Although this model has blis, I've almost been in 2 collisions because I cannot see my right side rear or left side rear due to the faulty design of the interior of the vehicle. The blis system did not warn me that there was a tractor trailer approaching me on the left side. This is a problem that the dealer cannot remedy. This is a factory design flaw that is going to get someone seriously injured or killed because the driver can't see what's coming. The blis is useless. Navigating through tight spaces is almost impossible because you cannot see the front end to judge your distance between vehicles\/objects and the wide front pillars also add to the frustration of trying to see what's on the side of the vehicle.

Currently the odometer reads 2,100 miles and they were not enjoyable miles. I have to say that this 2015 Explorer has the worst design on the inside that I've ever seen. The outward visibility from the driver's seat for the front and rear of this vehicle is severely compromised by the huge C pillars which create blind spots within the vehicle. Although this model has blis, I've almost been in 2 collisions because I cannot see my right side rear or left side rear due to the faulty design of the interior of the vehicle. The blis system did not warn me that there was a tractor trailer approaching me on the left side. This is a problem that the dealer cannot remedy. This is a factory design flaw that is going to get someone seriously injured or killed because the driver can't see what's coming. The blis is useless. Navigating through tight spaces is almost impossible because you cannot see the front end to judge your distance between vehicles\/objects and the wide front pillars also add to the frustration of trying to see what's on the side of the vehicle. The blower motor for the heating\/ac system just turns off as well as the dashboard cluster lights and then comes back on after 10 - 15 seconds. This has occurred a few times. There is a burning smell inside the vehicle upon start up. Not sure if it's exhaust gas entering the vehicle or if it's something in the heater\/ac system. (I was told at the dealership that this is a common problem and will dissipate after a few thousand miles). Not the answer that I wanted to hear. I do not feel safe driving this vehicle. The sensation of not feeling safe while driving makes for unsafe driving. My life and the lives of my passengers and other motorists is of my utmost concern.

Since then, no recalls or service bulletins have been released so I wasn't aware of it prior to purchasing. I bought it at night so this misalignment was not noticeable then. After I looked at it during the daytime, I noticed the misalignment and proceeded to contact the dealer I bought the vehicle from ... the result is as you read in the above paragraph.Ford washes their hands of this at this point. My only other options are to file a complain with BBB and\/or seek legal counsel. Would definitely love to hear from others who've experienced the same, I know you're out there and it is true this misalignment is common. I can't see how a multi-billion dollar corporation like Ford can consider producing vehicles where three doors align just fine while one is misaligned being \"normal\" and continue to produce them daily with the same issue.

The estimate was about $1100 to fix the hood. The dealer representative then said they would submit a claim to Ford. He did tell me that Ford would not cover the entire cost of repair if at all. WHAT?! You have a known problem affecting a Ford product and Ford says that they won't cover the repair?! He said that Ford knows that it is an issue affecting a lot of customers, but this how Ford is handling the issue right now.

My vehicle has less than 30,000 miles and I haven't run into anything or over anything to cause this problem. According to the service advisor the manufacturer's warranty covers the replacement, however, I'm stuck with having to drive a rental at my expense because of a defect from the manufacturer. I noticed there were other owners who had problems with the steering and they experienced failure that led to their wheel assembly coming off while driving.

Feeling concerned there's a greater issue????","256":"Basically, whenever I would turn - left or right - I'd hear this clicking or popping sound., Went to the dealer who basically had a Service Bulletin on it and said BOTH Axles need to be replaced. I've taken GREAT care of the car, having Ford do ALL scheduled maintenance. I expressed to them that an AXLE, (never mind 2), should not be failing after 45-50k miles. I feel as since there's a service bulletin, they KNEW about it but did no recall, as they are just waiting for whoever reports it. They said I was over my 3 year \/ 36,000 mile warranty, BUT since I bought if from their dealership and had ALL my maintenance done there, they would waive the cost.

She drove it about 2 miles further to the HEB grocery store and that's when the steering locked up and she coasted into the parking lot fighting the steering wheel the whole time. Thank God there was lite traffic that day. Once she got into the parking lot she had shut down everything( Turning the vehicle Off ). She then waited a couple of minutes and restarted, but that didn't work the wheel was still locked. She shut it down again and waited a little longer and restarted and it had reset itself back to normal. The Steering wheel was not locked anymore and she drove the vehicle back home with a Friend to follow her just in case it happened again. Well that following Monday the same ALERT warning came on while she was driving out of the subdivision and pulled over before she got onto FM 150 West shut the vehicle down before it happened and waited 5 minutes and restarted it again and it has not happened again YET!!! Today 10\/25\/16 We took it to our Ford Dealership were we bought the vehicle to have them look at it and they ran diagnostics on it and it spit some codes out EPAS was one of the errors. They tried to reproduce it, but could not. They called FORD Support and they were told to not replace it and to continue to drive the vehicle to see if it would come back on. The Ford Service Center stated that they will not close the ticket just in case it happens again. So Ford Support knows there is an issue, but is just waiting to get more information on it. They have been really lucky to this point that there has not been any fatalities or injuries that have been reported to them. My wife is very, very concerned about driving the vehicle now because this is her daily driver and we have a 6 yr. old that is always with her and that really scares her if it happens again. She said that it happened all of the sudden with little to no warning. If she would not have seen the Warning on the dash display it would have caught her by surprise. Doing some investigating on the internet there have been many other incidences similar to ours so what's it going to take to get a recall?","263":"just thank god turned off I-26 to get gas. total failure of steering. called ford for info that is a real pain in the ass. they wanted me to restart the engine several times to reprogram the car's computer.the real terror in dealing with this problem was there was no warning. one minute I was fat dumb and happy driving 75 miles per hr. and next second no steering.the Ford Dealer in Summerville repaired the car and Ford did pay for a rental, after repairs, about 9 days I had to drive back to Summerville this is a 3 hour drive each way","264":"1st time 3 days in shop for Warning Power Steering needs service. 2nd.

Ford will notauthorize the repair without a code, so not fixed after 10 days in the shop, my dealer did furnish me a car todrive & they are trying to help me, but NO help from Ford Motor Co.

Ford fixed this without debate but definitely confidence shaking.","266":"I purchased a 2015 Explorer Sport earlier this year and am getting numerous steering fault warnings with the steering just locking up - very scary! I restart the engine and everything appears to be normal again. Took the car to the dealership who verified the fault but they only deleted the warning from the computers memory, obviously it returned within a few days.

I managed to get the steering wheel straight again but noticed upon straightening out the wheels began to make a clicking noise. I took my vehicle to the dealership for repair (I purchased this vehicle March 31st 2015). After having my vehicle for 3 days and acknowledging they can hear the clicking sound AND they can even feel it under the floor boards, I was told extra washers needed to be added to the axle??????????At this point I have left a message for the Service Mgr, this is unacceptable!!! I purchased this vehicle 6 months ago with the expectations of it being a safe vehicle. At this point my frustration level is increasing with this dealership.I have never had a problem with any Ford I have owned before. But I paid for a vehicle that now seems like it may not be safe to drive.","268":"I had just turned into a parking lot off of a 4 lane Hwy. As I turned all power steering stopped. If we would have new traveling faster I'm confident an accident would have occurred. Very frustrated that Ford made it seem like they were doing me a favor by fixing it without charging me. Because the part had to be ordered its taking them 4 days to repair but they refuse to provide me with a rental even though I am still paying my car payment. I have less than 4,000 miles on my explorer.","269":"Live in Florida. Turn air on and it surges hard and then almost goes off. Not all the time. Very random. Dealer doesn't know how to fix at all.

Not to much fun when 90* out.","270":"automatic temperature control on Sync2 intermittently starts on its own to drop current setting both left and right with a click at each degree change until it reaches the lowest temperature or highest temperature. the on off button becomes disabled when this happens. Am I the only one with this problem?","271":"As a loyal Ford owner, this is very disappointing. There is clearly no customer loyalty from Ford - sadly. This was a problem that occurred when the vehicle was new. I notified the dealership (Marin County Ford) both verbally and eventually asked them to document the problem to ensure that it was noted while under warranty. The dealership checked it out on two occasions and could not fix it. They said they would have to take in the car for an extended period of time and would provide a loaner car. When this appointment arrived, they could not provide me with a loaner car, and therefor I could not leave my vehicle. By the time I was able to get another appointment, my Explorer was just over the 36,000 mile warranty period (like a couple of hundred miles). Both the dealer AND Ford Motor Co. have now refused to fix the problem.This is amazing to me given that I will never buy a Ford again. I have always wanted to buy American, and Ford was my favorite - that loyalty was just destroyed. Sad!","272":"My Explorer started leaking a vehicle exhaust fume into the cabin when entering the highway with the A\/C on which made me feel unwell.

The smell goes away if I just hit the button that recycles cabin air, so I figure it has to do with the vent system's location relative to something in the engine. I took it to the dealer and they said they couldn't smell anything, although that's crap because I smell it all the time. They did not charge me for the inspection, but I plan on taking it back to the dealer sometime soon, and get them to come into the car with me when I can smell it.This is a really bad problem. I hope someone at Ford hears our complaints.","276":"Since both my wife and daughter have asthma we have to take separate cars to go places. since I do not like getting into a Honda civic, too small for my 6'3\" frame. Sad part is I work at a Ford dealership so I take my truck into service all the time and I still can not get anywhere with this problem. They did several fixes on it but none has lasted a few days. I have test driven the 2016 and I did not smell nothing but I also did not smell nothing on mime for a few months so I do not know if the problem was fixed.

Very dissatisfied sorry i bought this lemon from ford. Still Fighting with them 4 months later","280":"On acceleration the engine exhaust fumes fill the cabin, its bad. I talked to the dealer and was told to accelerate slow (ha ha) just great! They did admit I'm not the only one with this problem, but there is no fix from Ford. If in fact you get the smell on acceleration, how do I know there is not low levels at all times.Update from Sep 14, 2016:Still no fix for the problem and hear nothing from Ford","281":"Posted the same complaint I encountered with the 2013 Explorer Limited. I bought the Sport and figured in two years this would not occur and it has. Upon acceleration there is a definite and pungent odor in the cabin similar to exhaust\/sulphur smell. Sometimes I have to open the window to clear it out and now worried about my grandkids smelling this. Only noticeable upon hard acceleration or steep hills where the transmission downshifts and rpm's go up. For all I know, it's happening all the time but not enough to hurt me but it could the kids. This is serious and I am going to bring it to the dealerships attention. This model has not changed in 3 years so who knows if the 2016 has corrected the problem. Not happy!!","282":"My husband and I just bought our 2015 Ford Explorer! It had 32 miles on it and little did we know it came with this exhaust stench with purchase!

I don't even want this car anymore after this problem. It's a major problem especially when you accelerate to higher speeds, it comes through vents even if recirculation is on. This is not a little smell, it's the smell of someone putting their head up to tailpipe! Ford fix this issue soon!Update from Dec 1, 2014:I had the service bulletin repair and nothing changed!  We're still experiencing an awful smell when you pass someone or lay on accelerator.","283":"Ok so I was looking to people complaining about the same odor in the 2013 model. It appears that the same issue could be on the 2015. When I initially used the vehicle on the highway I got the smell of burnt oil or an indescribable smell. I thought it was normal, so I kept driving days later my pregnant wife noticed the same thing from the same front vents. So I drove it and nothing. Weeks later the same thing and same odor. I'm mad because I really hope this does not affect my wife nor my baby. I took it for service.

We purchased our 2015 Explorer 12\/2014 and have had an exhaust odor inside while driving. Exhaust odor is very strong while going up long grades and hills or if the engine is under a load over 3500 rpm such as accelerating onto the highway. It is even worse if the A\/C is on and in re-circulation mode which should not be letting in the outside air. It is so strong that we have to roll the windows down to ventilate and we have had frequent headaches and light headedness while driving from all the fumes. We have had both TSB's completed which still have not solved our issue. On our 1st visit we were told nothing was wrong even though Ford has had a TSB on the issue and known since 2012. The next two times to the dealer, they did the TSB's. On the 4th visit they noted on our work order that odor may occur even with the repairs completed and did nothing else to try to resolve it. After another 300 miles and more headaches we took it back for the 5th visit on 7\/26\/2017 and they removed and resealed the rear spoiler per a Ford reps instructions. The dealer even had the nerve to tell us to not drive the car over 3500 RPM or use the re-circulation mode at all. So, we cannot basically use the car normally? Why did we purchase a new car? Just so I can have safety issues that my old car never had? At this point we are afraid to even drive the car as it really is just not safe and we STILL have the same issue, it is not resolved.","294":"I purchased this vehicle in October of 2015 and since that time, I have had nothing but issues with exhaust odor. It happens mostly under heavy acceleration or when putting a heavy load on the engine. When the smell comes in the cabin, it smells like rotten eggs or sulfur. I have contacted a dealer about the issue and was told it was normal for a new vehicle to have this type of smell. I have called multiple times since 2015 and was told the same thing time and time again.Coming this week, I will contact my Ford Dealer again and will ask them to investigate Service Bulletin TSB 14-0130. Hopefully they will see this is an issue and attempt to resolve the problem.","295":"The potential of carbon monoxide poising is NOT to be taken lightly.

I happened whenever I accelerated pretty hard (for example, in a hurry to pass someone on a two lane road). I looked around on the internet and found that others had complained about it too but Ford had done nothing. It was very annoying but I didn't think anything was going to be done about it and it only happened under certain circumstances, so I didn't make a big stink about it.Yesterday, I received a notice in the mail asking if I had paid any money to get that problem fixed because lots of other people had that problem and there was a law suit being filed against Ford to get people reimbursed and to get the vehicles fixed that had not yet been fixed. Apparently, someone had passed out while driving and hit a tree because of the level of exhaust in the vehicle. I did some more research and found that there is a Technical Service Bulletin out (TSB 14-0130 ) which has a procedure for Ford technicians to follow to correct the problem. I don't understand why Ford has not notified me about this bulletin themselves. Seems like they wouldn't want someone to get killed from inhaling exhaust fumes while driving and then crashing as a result. I am currently trying to arrange for that TSB to be applied to my Explorer. If it really does get fixed, I'll come back here and update this post.I do not know how many times this has happened over the last 2 years but it has happened many times. I cannot put one of these write ups in here for each occurrence. It happens enough that I can predict when it is going to happen because all I have to do is accelerate hard to make it happen.","301":"We have been smelling this terrible exhaust odor since we bought the 2015 Explorer.

Ford is being very stubborn on this issue, it's there it's real and someday someone is going to pass out and get killed. I guess they'll fix the problem them?","304":"At hard acceleration there is a horrible smell in the cabin. I did some research on a Explorer Forum and read if you turn on the air condition circulation the exhaust will not enter the cabin.

I had to end up leaving the Explorer up at Ford for 2 and a half weeks.

Vehicle drifted to side of road and was put in park and back into drive and the vehicle worked fine. On 06\/29\/2016 was in a parking lot going 10 mph when the same issue occurred. Again put it in park and back into drive and the vehicle worked fine. Drove 6 miles down the road and the same issue occurred, around 25 mph. Again vehicle drifted off of the road and this time the vehicle had to be turned off and turned back on to get the vehicle to work. With all three instances the engine was on just no response from the accelerator and there was no wrench symbol displayed. The vehicle flashed the error code full accessory power active and the start button would flash. Vehicle was dropped off at the Ford dealership we purchased it new on 06\/29\/16 with 340 miles. No error codes were detected when the tech plugged the vehicle in. As of 08\/02\/16 vehicle is still at the dealer and the dealer is waiting for Ford to offer ideas on how to fix this issue.

He told my wife to let it sit a few minutes then try to restart it. It did start and drove it home with the wrench symbol on.

I coasted to the side of the road before stopped and put on my hazards. I called Ford roadside assistance and was stuck in the side of the road with my 2 kids while it took more then 3 hrs before I cancelled and left the car until the following morning for aaa. It was sent to freehold Ford where they told me it was a throttle body defect and that it needs to be replaced.

Also, all 4 original equipment tires blew-out with less than 6,000 miles - only one had a road-hazard - all had sidewall failures. Ford repaired the throttle-body assembly but not the tires. To keep us happy, they offered us an \"extended warranty\" - this was never provided - indeed, despite repeated E-mails to 2 Ford representatives over a 3-month time-period, I no longer receive any response from them whatsoever. Therefore, it would seem that not only are they providing a dangerous product, they are also deceptive in their handling of customers.-Danville, CA, USA","354":"2016 Ford Explorer with hankook ventus S1 noble 2 tires. Approximately 3 months ago my wife was driving on a local surface street at 45 mph. Her tire pressure monitor illuminated on the dash while simultaneously the vehicle veered sharply to the right. Upon inspection there was a 2-3 inch laceration in the sidewall of the front passenger side tire. There were not any potholes in the street where this incident occurred. Tire seemed to have simply \"blown out\". tire was replaced. Yesterday my wife was making a left turn from from one surface street to another traveling approximately 15-20 mph and the replacement tire blew out again. Similar details; tire pressure monitor illuminated while vehicle suddenly veered to the right. Again, no potholes were present and zero indication of foreign objects causing flat. There was approximately a 2-3 inch laceration to sidewall of front passenger tire. These two incidents occurred in a relatively short time span. I have read complaints about weak sidewalls regarding these tires as early as 2013. Additionally, hankook and Hyundai have issued a recall for these tires (albeit a different size) due to sidewall problems. Without potholes and\/or foreign objects causing the flat tires, it seems obvious that these tires are defective. My wife does not feel safe in her vehicle, and is afraid that another blowout may occur while traveling at higher speeds (freeway).-Livonia, MI, USA","355":"Wife's explorer with a little over 8k miles already has bad front tires. Especially the passenger side. We have never hit a pothole or curb with it. The inside of the tire is completely wasted and the rubber is starting to flake off. The driver's side is not as bad but it is getting there.I took it to my local Ford dealership and they submitted the pictures of the tires to Ford and Hankook and they said it was an alignment issue. The car does not pull to the sides. It tracks perfectly. I don't have a problem fixing wear and tear items but I do have a problem with having to spend $500-$600 on two tires and an alignment. My F150 has 24k miles and it has never been re-aligned. Hopefully Ford or Hankook will realize that there is something wrong with these tires.","356":"hankook ventus s1 noble 2 sidewall failure2016 Ford Explorer Limited with 4,186 miles. Vehicle is equipped with Hankook Ventus S1 Noble 2 tires size 255\/50 R20. Shortly after backing out of the driveway and while driving out of our subdivision at approximately 25 mph the warning chime started sounding. Dash display indicated low tire pressure in the passenger side front tire. Display started at about 25psi but quickly fell. Before we could turn around and return to the house, 200 yards, the tire was completely flat. After removal we found that the inside sidewall had \"blown out\". Since it was the weekend I decided to use the time to do some research on Hankooks. (I have a 2015 Genesis and my Genesis dealer told me Hyundai had switched to Michelin for the Genesis due to \"many complaints\" about the Hankooks.) I was surprised and disappointed to find Hankook had issued a recall in January 2016 for this same model time, but not in the size used on the 2106 Explorer. The recall was for inside sidewall failures, the exact problem we suffered. Om Monday I went to my local Ford dealer, explained the problem as well as my research and requested that Ford replace all 4 tires with Michelin Premiere LTX. I told them I had no faith in the safety of the Hankooks. The service manager agreed to submit my request to Ford. The next day I opened a problem case with the Ford customer center as the service manager had informed me he was have trouble getting Ford to respond to the case. While the service manager kept me updated on his discussions with Ford and Hankook, I decided to stop in on Friday afternoon for a face-to-face update. The service manager informed me that Hankook came back with an offer to provide a 40% discount for the purchase of a new tire. The service manager said he had not contacted me about Hankook's offer as it was unsatisfactory to him and he knew it would be unsatisfactory to me. I re-contacted Ford customer service and escalated the issue to a manager after the customer service rep told me Ford has to stand behind their supplier's decision. Of course this means Ford does not really stand behind their product. I am quite disappointed that Ford would install these tires on the Explorer. While I am not a tire engineer, from my research it appears this tire does fine on lighter weight vehicles, but on heavier vehicles such as the Genesis and Explorer the thin sidewalls are a problem. I am especially disappointed that Ford would install this tire on a vehicle that was ordered with a tow package. Needless to say, these tires are going to be replaced one way or another and I will never buy another Hankook. I also suggest anyone buying an Explorer require the dealer replace the Hankooks.","357":"On Oct. 18 while operating at highway speed of 40 mph on hwy. 301 South in wilson nc and attempting to slow down to stop for the traffic stopped at the traffic light ahead the brake pedal and steering both did not function, I was unable to stop or steer the vehicle causing a rear-end collision to hit the vehicle in front of mine.

A few months ago as I was turning onto the highway a \"lane keeping sys malfunction\" alert came across my display and my steering locked in place. I could not turn my steering wheel at all. I had a sketchy vehicle for my first vehicle and knew that I needed to put the car in park and turn it off for a few seconds and restart the car. Doing this freed my steering wheel and I was able to drive to the dealership. The dealership ran diagnostics and came to the conclusion that the sensitivity was set too high. Ffw months later. 9\/13\/16 I am driving back at about 65 mph, from a dr. Apt on a busy road and the car tells me my steering is malfunctioning to service my vehicle. My game plan was to pull over safely and run a vehicle health report and call the dealer. Seconds later I get the same message along with lane keeping malfunction & my steering locked. I had to come to a complete stop on the middle of a busy hwy with a car coming at my rear and throw it in park and kill my engine and restart my car for the steering to unlock. I spoke with the service dept. After they ran diagnostics and my vehicle is \"spitting out codes like crazy\" and was told it may be a module in my computer that controls steering & lane keeping systems or my key fob is not being detected by my computer and is not sending an alert and my car thinks it is being stolen. Crazy. Definitely not safe. This is my daily driver. I have 4 small children. I live in my car. Please research this and issue a recall. This is not safe at all.

I am a police officer, and have seen where windows explode or are smashed. The window will take a slight indent or poof outward from the force. In this case, the window was poofed outward.

A few months ago as I was turning onto the highway a \"lane keeping sys malfunction\" alert came across my display and my steering locked in place. I could not turn my steering wheel at all. I had a sketchy vehicle for my first vehicle and knew that I needed to put the car in park and turn it off for a few seconds and restart the car. Doing this freed my steering wheel and I was able to drive to the dealership. The dealership ran diagnostics and came to the conclusion that the sensitivity was set too high. Ffw months later. 9\/13\/16 I am driving back at about 65 mph, from a dr. Apt on a busy road and the car tells me my steering is malfunctioning to service my vehicle. My game plan was to pull over safely and run a vehicle health report and call the dealer. Seconds later I get the same message along with lane keeping malfunction & my steering locked. I had to come to a complete stop on the middle of a busy hwy with a car coming at my rear and throw it in park and kill my engine and restart my car for the steering to unlock. I spoke with the service dept. After they ran diagnostics and my vehicle is \"spitting out codes like crazy\" and was told it may be a module in my computer that controls steering & lane keeping systems or my key fob is not being detected by my computer and is not sending an alert and my car thinks it is being stolen. Crazy. Definitely not safe. This is my daily driver. I have 4 small children. I live in my car. Please research this and issue a recall. This is not safe at all.

The consumer stated while driving on a main road, he heard a loud thud accompanied by an immediate and complete loss of power. The engine was still running, but the vehicle quickly lost speed and the accelerator was not functioning. It seemed as though the engine was idling. The consumer was able to maneuver the vehicle safely out of traffic and had the vehicle towed to the dealer. The dealer informed the consumer, the throttle body needed to be replaced. Also, there was a recurring electrical issue that he experienced in January 2016 with the first month of delivery. The vehicle was towed to the dealer for service on two separate occasions due to dead batteries.-Boca Raton, FL, USA","416":"I rented a 2016 Ford Explorer from avis at the portland (me) airport (avis vehicle #40933351). On Friday, July 15th, the unit stalled as I pulled into an intersection. The accelerator was non-responsive and the car moved at a very reduced rate of speed. Several lights on the dashboard lit up - check engine, airbag, and a note came up to check the owner's manual. I was able to finish crossing the intersection at the slower speed and pull to the side of the road. I shut the car off and restarted it and it operated properly for a while. Later that night, I stopped at a stop light. When the light turned green, I made a left hand turn. Once again, the accelerator stopped working and the dashboard lit up with multiple warning lights. I pulled to the side of the road and called avis roadside assistance. The person on the line told me this was a common issue with Ford Explorer and that I had to turn the car off, step on the accelerator, then put my foot on the brake and restart the car to clear the fault but the check engine light would stay on. The check engine light stayed on but I was able to pull back onto the road at full speed. Approximately 1\/4 mile down the road I stopped at a traffic light. Once again, I began to cross the intersection when the accelerator stopped working and the dashboard lit up. I pulled over and reset the car as I had done before and proceeded to drive away. A few hundred feet away, the accelerator stopped working again and the dashboard lit up. I was able to pull over, reset the car and drive away. This is an extremely dangerous condition that needs to be fixed immediately.

I was able to turn the car on, however, the vehicle would only move at idle speed while in drive. Fortunately I had enough to idle my way to the side of the road. The part that went out was the throttle body. Although the manufacturer replaced the part on the vehicle, I feel that they have been very irresponsible in not recalling this part and advising buyers that the car has a \"faulty\" throttle body. Everyone at Ford that I have spoke to almost immediately knew what the issue leading me to believe that I am not the only person that has had this issue. This issue could have caused a severe accident if the car would have shut off or de-ccelerated while driving at a high rate of speed.-Miami, FL, USA","418":"Was driving along busy road making a left turn at rush hour across two lanes of traffic.

The seat moved up and forward, while the steering wheel moved down. My legs started to get compressed by the steering wheel, while at the same time my knees were being forced into the plastic pieces under the steering column. My body was being forced against the steering wheel. I tried to stop the seat from moving by using my body to create a force but the seat would not stop. When the seat finally stopped, my legs were in pain and I could barely breathe from the steering wheel being against my chest. I panicked and didn't know what to do. My husband had to open the drivers side door and use the controls to get me free. I was afraid for my life, I could've been severely injured. If my husband were the one to press the button while he was sitting in the drivers seat, he would have broken bones. My rental provider never showed us the features of the vehicle, nor were there any written warning labels in clear sight on the inside of the vehicle. My husband informed me after the incident that the numbered buttons on the door are a memory function for the seat. It is now a strong fear of mine that if I were driving this vehicle, and I accidentally pressed this button (thinking I pressed the lock control),that I would be in a car accident. The design of this memory function is flawed and needs to be corrected immediately before someone gets severely injured or killed. I am also fearful that the rental company will rent this vehicle to someone else, because a larger person than myself, will undoubtedly be injured or killed. Whether this is a factory preset or a function that had been programmed by a previous renter or the rental company, I am unaware, but it needs to be addressed.-East Chatham, NY, USA","425":"Rear automatic hatch opens not just when you kick forward under back of car, BUT opens just by walking adjacent in the rear and \/or rear side.","426":"Hill Descent control fault with Service advance trac, powertrain failure alarm (wrench alarm), traction control On\/Off ABS on at same timeUpdate from Jan 16, 2016:Here is the youtube link for the issue:https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cU3uJfdUwmo","427":"I was out running errands, needed to get home to pick up my daughter from school and monitor my father-in-law, whom was hooked up to a dialysis machine.

I was driving about 60 miles per on hour on a city street and all of a sudden a wrench symbol shows and the car will not accelerate anymore. I had never seen this symbol before so I wasn't sure what was going on and could not find it in the manual. Before this I only could go about 5 miles per hour max speed.

This vehicle should be recalled and not sold! our entire trip this vehicle made the sound nonstop. A person should not have to hear this the entire time on a brand new vehicle that you make monthly payments on. Something should be done about this. Since Ford does not want to voluntarily issue a recall like they should, an involuntary recall should be issued.

Took the vehicle back to the dealer and Ford says they will repaint it. Well, take a look at the 2011-Present complaints on the explorers and you can quickly see that having them repaint your hood is not a good idea. So I ask to have a new hood put on. I get told that is not an option. So I have a BRAND NEW vehicle with FACTORY defects and Ford will not make it right. This will be my last Ford product. I sure hope everyone who is considering an explorer sees this prior to purchasing one. I wish I had. If you don't care about the appearance and quality of the vehicle then this is the SUV for you. Also, while I was at the dealer I looked over the only other Shadow Black Explorer they had and it also had the same issues just in different locations!","447":"Brand new Explorer and it has two spots in the door that I can see just approaching it are paint flaws from the factory. One spot looks like dirt under the paint and the other spot you can see the primer where the paint did not cover it. White primer really stands out with Ruby Red paint.","448":"The transmission drain plugs were loose. The vehicle has 5064 miles. I had been noticing an odor and thought I had a coolant leak. But the smell was not \"sweet\" enough. I crawled under the car after a 700 mile trip because the order was very prevalent. I notice transmission fluid on one of the transmission drain plugs. There was a plume of transmission fluid going from the transmission to the back of the car. Some of the fluid had contacted the exhaust components. I check the fluid level ( flat surface, engine hot and running) and the fluid did not even contact the dip stick. I then went to see if the plug(s) was loose. It is a 11mm. I was able to get 2.5 turns on the plug using just my fingers. On the second plug I was able to get 1 full turn with just my fingers. The 1st plug only had about 3 threads engaged. I am concerned that if other vehicles have this condition, a fire or complete lose of transmission fluid could occur. If a plug falls out while traveling at highway speeds a serious accident could occur.-Novi, MI, USA","449":"While driving in traffic there was a loud noise and the car lost power had try and get out of traffic with no power.

Luckily I was near an exit so I coasted to a halt off the interstate. I restarted the car, it drove at no more than 5mph to a safer spot. After sometime waiting for a tow truck I restarted the car, it worked this time but with a check engine light. I drove slowly and on county roads, back home. Now in dealer to be fixed. I have read multiple examples of this problem on this website and generally.

We were extremely fortunate that no one was hurt as we tried to make our way to the right shoulder from the left lane (there was inadequate shoulder on the left when the failure occurred). No question in our mind that this is life threatening! we feel fortunate we were near an exit, so we limped along at 5 mph to a gas station. The vehicle was towed to a dealership and next day verified that the electronic throttle body was defective. The dealer changed this part out and we fortunately have not had a recurrence. Mileage at failure was 9456. One would not expect a throttle body to fail, especially at low mileage.

We coasted at least half a mile before finding a place to safley exit the road. I called roadside assistance and they woud not authorize payment to tow my vechile back home, and I had to wait 45 minutes for assistance to arrive. I am so disappointed and saddened to think what may have happened if I had choose to take the highway instead. I could only clutch the steering wheel as I watched my speedometer drop from 58 to 20 something in a matter of minutes. I had children sitting in the 3rd row and was concerned that someone would run into me due to my sudden decline in speed. I cannot believe that I was not notified that this could happen.

They replaced the part at no cost, but I have no confidence they actually know the issue or if this will happen over and over. Based on the other reports I have seen this always happens around 7000 miles.

Most recent update just occurred yesterday (2-14-17). I dropped off my suv at the dealership, Maxwell Ford in Austin as I have done countless times before, to have a creaking and knocking noise looked at and hopefully repaired this time. After driving around with my service advisor and the front-end vehicle specialist for a half hour we located the area of the exact noise was coming from. That was on a Thursday (2-09-17) and after waiting a few days I decided to call the body shop, as that's what service informed me of where it was going to be repaired the day after it was dropped off, only to find out they could not or will not fix the problem and it was kicked back to service. The body shop explained they could not fix the issue as it had to do with the welded portion of the center pillar under the vehicle and any fix would compromise the integrity of the structure of the vehicle. I am limbo at this point as I await to see what the next steps are. If it is a structural issue that cannot be fixed due to the fact it might inhibit the airbags from deploying in a car accident, they why is this not considered a defect and why does it not qualify for the \"Ford Buy-Back Program?\" The body shop stated it will not cut into the frame to fix \"a noise issue\" as it is not worth it, now I get that but this is a brand new car (or at least it was when I signed my lease)and it should not have the issues it has been having. There have been countless other problems with this vehicle on top of this most recent one. It makes me sad to think that I'm stuck with a noisy racket of ash*ttyvehicle for however long I have left on my lease. I will update when I hear back from Ford with their \"options\" but I'm not holding my breath and neither should you.","470":"Nosie while driving My for explorer makes this noise on most days. I took it to Tri-county ford in Lagrange Ky To have it fixed but the ford technician was unable to reproduce the noise. I tried showing them videos of the noise but they have to hear it for themselves I'm told. Anyone have an idea what could be making the noise. Tri-county said it could be my aftermarket hitch that's making the noise.","471":"Add us to the list. #33 I think. 2016 Ford Explorer with 6,400 miles just left us stranded. Cruising along at 60 mph, I'm pressing the gas and nothing! Luckily we were able to pull into a left turn lane of a four lane highway. 'Wrench' warning came on. Looked it up and it states that it's a powertrain failure, contact qualified repair center immediately. Then I find so much info on the internet that there should be a recall, but Ford will not put one in place for this problem.

Just a thud and I had to drift to the shoulder. Had the wrench, engine as well as several other lights pop on. Had to get it towed to the dealer. It started right up and they were able to drive it into the bay... Although the wrench and engine lights were on. My frustration level has just exponentially increased when I saw all of the other complaints here for the same thing.","474":"On a summer vacation to tour National Parks in ND and SD, we rented a 2016 Ford Explorer on August 11, 2016 and drove it in and around Fargo, ND for two days with no problems. On August 13, 2016 we were driving along a state highway in southern ND and completely lost power. The driver could not accelerate. Dashboard warning lights, including the passenger side airbag, wrench and check engine lights came on. We were able to roll into a rural driveway and turn off the car for 10 minutes or so while we placed calls to the rental car company. If we hadn't been in a rural area with very little traffic, this could have resulted in a serious accident.We were able to start the car and drive to the closest airport that could provide a replacement rental car. Rental car company personnel claimed that they had not heard about any problems with the 2016 Ford Explorer. We made the decision to change cars based on the number of people who reported the same problem on carcomplaints.com. Thank you!","475":"While driving in traffic car lost the ability to go when gas pedal was pushed....had to coast to side of road and hope I had enough momentum to make it and not get hit. Major problem that I hope Ford fixes before someone gets killed due to their explorer losing its ability to accelerate.","476":"July 4, only a few hours ago, driving home from fireworks display with a car full of kids in a torrential downpour, my Explorer suddenly decelerated from a speed of 45 MPH and gas pedal was not working. Wrench light came on, and then the airbag light. We were scared out of our wits. The car was virtually now in neutral.As the mom and the driver, I had to keep everyone calm, but was a total wreck inside. I was about 4 miles from home, and by the grace of God, was able to coast along the shoulder with hazards on all the way home. Swinging into my driveway, we were going 8MPH. When safe in the driveway I let the kids all inside and had a good long cry. I shudder to think what could have happened.I am appalled to see that Ford definitely knows this is a problem and isn't voluntarily recalling these vehicles! Does someone have to DIE before they do something proactive?!?I plan on calling the dealership in the morning and I know they will be great about service and a loaner, but I am LIVID. My next call will be to corporate, and if this BRAND new $48,000 vehicle isn't fixed properly, I will be contacting a lemon law attorney as well as every press outlet that will listen.Ford certainly has enough money to pay for six figure ads on TV, touting their \"sales\" claiming how their vehicles are \"American tough\". Seems like they could divert some of those funds to prove it. I will update as this escalates.","477":"I was out of town and driving back home on a Sunday (about 2 hours away from home) when the engine, suddenly, would no longer accelerate. I was able to coast to a reasonably safe place out in the middle of no where. A wrench icon appeared in the driver display and a pop-up was displayed which also featured a wrench and text to the effect of 'see owner's manual'. According to the manual, the wrench icon demonstrated a 'power-train' issue. The vehicle had power, the engine never quit running, and all electronics stayed working normally. It was idling rough, however, and the gas pedal had no effect in any gear (from drive to reverse). The vehicle would move forward or backward (depending on gear) only to the extent of a normal idle despite pressure to the gas pedal.The vehicle was towed to the closest Ford Dealership and, because the dealership was closed (Sunday), I was forced to figure out my own way to get home so that my wife and I could make it to work on Monday morning. The vehicle is still at the dealership, after a total of 2 whole weeks. The problem was diagnosed as a throttle body issue and the newly, reworked part (which even has a different part number than what was originally shipped from the factory with the vehicle) is on backorder. I was recently informed that the dealership has received another 2016 Explorer with the same problem, since receiving mine. This is a Ford dealership in a town of 2,000 people, mind you.All in all, AWESOME experience to have after purchasing a brand new $40,000 vehicle....(insert sarcasm). Probably won't buy another Ford.","478":"I bought this vehicle at the end of January 2016. Only have 3660 miles and already 2x I have had the Power Train light and the Check Engine Light on...

At 13k miles I started to get this strong burn\/fuel smell. Was afraid to drive so my husband drove it to the nearest Ford dealership (not where I purchased it) they wouldn't give a loaner and had to fight with Ford corporate to cover my rental cost while my car was being fixed. Finding out it's up to the discretion of the dealership to give you a loaner doesn't matter how new your car is. They had my car for a week. returned is saying it definitely had a smell but couldn't locate the problem. I took it home and it continued to smell again. This time I called the Ford dealership where I purchased my car. I took it in and they were very accommodating with getting me a loaner since I purchased the vehicle there. After a week said they also could not find anything and think that it was possibly something I ran over that stuck to the vehicle and was burning off. I took my car and eventually the smell went away. now it's 4 months later and I'm at 18k miles and leaving work yesterday when I put my car in reverse it made a thud noise and it was difficult to go into reverse. I was able to drive to pick up my son from school but when he opened the door the smell hit me. My son was like, \"Your car smells like it's burning.\" When pulling out in reverse it was worse this time, It made a noise and sounded like I ran over something. was able to drive home with the smell intensifying. I called road side and they towed my SUV to the dealership this morning. I'm anticipating the news....WTF!!!","481":"This is my second MAJOR problem with my 2016 Explorer. It currently has 17,000 miles, bought it brand new. The first problem was the Throttle Body, now its the transmission. I was out driving, pulled into a parking lot and was never able to drive out, because my car won't go into reverse. It had to be towed to a dealership, who did not have a loaner for me. They kept my vehicle for 2 weeks, claimed they fixed it, but less than 24 hours later it is back at the dealership. It developed a loud rattling sound, that to date they cannot find. They even changed a part on the axel, but that was not the problem. I am highly annoyed with Ford to say the least.I'm coming very close to having this vehicle qualify for the Lemon Law status.Update from Feb 22, 2017:I received a call from the dealership today, they did everything Ford Hotline told them to do, BUT the problem is still there. We are waiting for more instructions. This is a very \"enjoyable\" experience.

I turn on the flashers, put it into park, waited a few seconds and prayed it would restart unlike the last time when the throttle body went and I couldn't get out of the way. Luckily, it did restart and I got home. I was scared the rest of my 40 minute ride praying that it didn't happen again.When I called the dealer who fixed the throttle body, I got the 'well have to bring it in and take a look at it' speech. OK great when, next week.......These 2 problems happened almost exactly 1 year apart.

All I can do is shake my damn head.................","484":"I paid over $50,000.00 for a Ford Explorer Sport. My husband wanted another Volvo, I opted for an American product. Without warning the transmission completely failed. I was driving through a busy intersection when it started to buck, I assumed it was related to snow on one of the many sensors. Approaching a notoriously dangerous merge of RT 95 & RT 395 in Connecticut, the car barely responded when I stepped on the gas, and I am fortunate it was a holiday with limited traffic. I parked the car to clear off all of the snow, when I got in to back it out of the spot, it would not move. No indicators of a problem were lit up, the car just would not move.It was towed to a local dealership, where it has sat for the past two weeks.

I am so disappointed with the Ford DealerIf you have any suggestions, please call me or have you a name of a good trial attorney. SP 404-931-8753","497":"Our 2016 Ford Explorer has exhaust fumes getting into cabin when accelerating up a hill or onto a freeway under harder acceleration, also in passing gear and when you back off to normal speed you get an awful smell in the cabin through the ventilation. We have had it back to dealership at least six times or more and also talked to a Ford customer service rep at least six times with no fix. The mufflers were replaced but no change was made to fumes getting into cabin. After recently researching the problem we have found out that this has been occurring since the production of the 2011 Ford Explorers. Carbon monoxide is a health hazard. How can Ford keep ignoring the problem and getting away with it when this is a health hazard? We keep getting the run around with Ford customer service because there is no fix to it - but the government lets them keep building faulty Explorers. If it wasn't for the unhealthy fumes we would be 100% satisfied with our 2016 Ford Explorer Limited.","498":"I have owned a 2016 Ford Explorer for 10 months. After anout a week of driving I noticed a very strong burning smell coming into the cabin. I brought to dealer only to be told that it must be a burning sticker on engine. Well 10 months later the smell is as strong as ever! I have noticed many other complaints online and there needs to be a class action lawsuit against Ford. This is ridiculous, For a brand new car!Update from Jan 25, 2017:An update to this site is- my fuel tank was replaced after it was proven to have a major gas leak. The fuel neck was replaced one month later. No change- still very strong gas Oder. What else needs to happen before they replace my car that I am paying a fortune for!!???  I can not park the car inside the garage as the entire house will smell of gasoline.","499":"if you exceed it, a strong exhaust stinking smell comes through. l would want Ford to take full \"Responsibility \" and fix the problem or repurchase the Vehicle back","500":"I have had 2 Ford Explorers. The first one was a 2013 which was broadsided by a tractor trailer in June 2016 and was totaled. I liked the Explorer so bought a 2016. Both of these vehicles have the odor in the cabin problem so it is obvious that Ford does not know what the problem is nor how to fix it. It seems to me that with all the complaints that they would address this as this is a horrible odor. While it hasn't made me sick,..yet....I have no idea of the damage that the fumes might be causing health wise. Safety comes in many forms and breathing possible toxic fumes is right at the top of the list.","501":"Definitely getting an exhaust or burning smell in the cabin after a hard acceleration. I read online that there is no fix for this issue so did not bother taking the time to take it to the dealer. Just another reason I will not buy another Ford Explorer.","502":"Smell of exhaust fumes in the cabin under acceleration","503":"I have a 2015 Ford Explorer that I bought new. I have had it in the shop three times now, for exhaust fumes in the cabin. I just recently picked it up Thursday. They replaced the exhaust mufflers with turn down exhaust. We ask the service manager if he drove it. To see if that fixed the problem. He said no, but he had all the confidence that this will work. Well guess what, it didn't! Now I have another call into the service department. I have a vacation trip planned with my grandkids coming up. This is so annoying to pay so much for a car that stays in the shop more than on the road. I love my Explorer, but I can't keep dealing with this problem. Plus not having a car to drive, but still making the payments. This is a Ford problem that should be fixed, plus give the customer another car to drive. While you try to figure out the mistake.","504":"So on its first road trip. On every uphill, the Ford Explorer cabin was filling up with carbon monoxide. So bad, that I was rolling down the windows. After 4 times to service. Ford insisted the problem was fixed.I purchased a co meter after the 3rd service visit with a day apart each visit. I tested the meter and recorded levels rise during uphill. Air outside was zero, cabin was 4 parts per million on a 5 minute uphill. I showed the service and general managers at Galpin Ford. Still no help. They tested with my meter and showed 2 parts. I can get that thing above 12 parts on the baker grade when I get a chance and post it on YouTube in the next few weeks.I have purchased 5 Fords from the same dealership. Ford and Galpin are treating a loyal customer like dirt. After the first service they said to drive it 5000 more miles and smell will go away. It's a rotten egg smell that leaks through cat into AC vents. This is a huge issue and Ford is hiding. Big corporation killing its customers with co gas and they are hiding.what a bunch of chickens. Just running from the problem.","505":"Early this month I bought a brand new 2016 Ford Explorer to my wife. The first day we went to try our new suv and above 65 miles\/hr we start to smell a bad odor into the cabin. I immediately took it back to the Ford Official dealer and they start to try to solve the problem. Different to others experiences, the Ford Team in my city tried to help me, the manager of this dealer went to try the suv with me and certified the problem. After several days they found a numerous open spaces in the back door of the suv, apparently Ford is not taking care about back door isolation, light and water is leaking into the cabin after some tests made by the mechanics at ford dealer. They tried to isolate the open areas with some materials but the smell keep into the cabin under the same driving conditions. After many investigations I figured out that all this suvs have a problem of air and fume turbulence generation in the back side of them, this a design problem but other car manufacturers have different actions to avoid this problem in their cars. Last week I went to the dealer to return my Limited Ford Explorer 2016 with less than 400 miles... I'm waiting for Ford to return my money or really solve the problem but I don't have much hopeness because after read different stories, this problem comes from 2012 models and Ford hasn't made anything... If Ford Motors does not matter to poison my family with carbon monoxide I will have this issue until the last consequences...","506":"I love my Explorer. Great looking, ride is comfortable and very quiet. Lots of nice options with just an XLT. Only problem I am having is that when I accelerate above 3000 rpm a very strong obnoxious odor enters the cabin. It smell like a burnt carbon smell coming from the exhaust. I was going to wait till I hit 3000 miles on the vehicle to have it looked it. Reason is I was hoping its just because its new. Then got thinking, my 2013 Explorer started doing that before I traded it in but was not nearly as bad as my 2016. I am going to have it looked at.","507":"Sept 31st - with 358 miles and less than owned for 24 hours all adaptive equipment failed, flashing ABS failure loss of speed control.

I took the car and drove 39 miles and we sustained a total repeat of the problems. At this point the dealership said they had no idea at point what was wrong or the cause of the problem, approximately five days later I was told the cause was the failure of the rear ABS wheel sensor which they told me was replaced and also that they had driven the car for few days and it was now operational. I did pick up the car and again within a few miles we sustained the same failure with an added feature I backed out of my parking space and found that I had lost any ability to move forward and there was a severe grinding noise emanating from transmission, drove the back to dealer ship for the fourth time and was told that even though I was told that the Ford dealer mechanic did not replace any parts as I was told. As of today Sept 18th the car is still with the dealer and was told that in fact replaced the left ABS wheel sensor but they said that in fact was not the problem and that it still existed. I was told that they were think it is being caused by some type of short in a wire harness but they still are awaiting parts. I have requested a meeting with a Ford representative but I was told by the service manager that he could not arrange a meeting.

When vehicle was ready for pick up we noticed that the driver side middle row seat material was pulled away from the foam cushion. The selling dealer said they would put a warranty claim into Ford to get the seat fixed. We received a call from dealer a few weeks later and said Ford would fix the seat and take the vehicle to a dealer closer to our area to have it fixed under warranty. We took the vehicle to the dealer and the warranty person there would not even come out and look at it since we did not buy it there. I called the Ford cs line and made a complaint. They called the dealer and asked them to look at the seat. We took the vehicle back to them and they took pictures and sent to Ford for warranty approval. We received a call from cs and they said the pictures did not show any damage and no repairs would be made. I asked the cs person if I could send my pictures of the seat and they said ok. I sent pictures of the seat damage and Ford went back and forth with me and even got a warranty rep involved. The bottom line is that the seat cushion is pulled away from the foam and it is damaged, Ford did get back with me and said it is not damaged and they will not cover under warranty. My advice to anyone thinking about buying a Ford product especially an Explorer is not to. Apparently quality control is not one of their main points. The vehicle only has 3550 miles on it and already the radio has quit working and the front end makes a clunking noise when I take off. Wonder if that will be covered under warranty. Very disappointed!-Wilmington, OH, USA","513":"While I was sitting in the driver's seat of my rental (the vehicle running and in park), I pressed #2 of the numbered buttons, next to the lock controls, and the seat started moving by itself. The seat moved up and forward, while the steering wheel moved down. My legs started to get compressed by the steering wheel, while at the same time my knees were being forced into the plastic pieces under the steering column. My body was being forced against the steering wheel. I tried to stop the seat from moving by using my body to create a force but the seat would not stop. When the seat finally stopped, my legs were in pain and I could barely breathe from the steering wheel being against my chest. I panicked and didn't know what to do. My husband had to open the drivers side door and use the controls to get me free. I was afraid for my life, I could've been severely injured. If my husband were the one to press the button while he was sitting in the drivers seat, he would have broken bones. My rental provider never showed us the features of the vehicle, nor were there any written warning labels in clear sight on the inside of the vehicle. My husband informed me after the incident that the numbered buttons on the door are a memory function for the seat. It is now a strong fear of mine that if I were driving this vehicle, and I accidentally pressed this button (thinking I pressed the lock control),that I would be in a car accident. The design of this memory function is flawed and needs to be corrected immediately before someone gets severely injured or killed. I am also fearful that the rental company will rent this vehicle to someone else, because a larger person than myself, will undoubtedly be injured or killed. Whether this is a factory preset or a function that had been programmed by a previous renter or the rental company, I am unaware, but it needs to be addressed.-East Chatham, NY, USA","514":"dash broad displayed terrain management system faultThis alarm came with the other 2 alarms in display repeatedly and make me felt the car is crazy.Update from Jan 16, 2016:Here is youtube link for the issuehttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cU3uJfdUwmo","515":"This is really pissing me off.

Called dealership, we were 260 miles away, they said it was an easy fix, was told to turn off recycle for our trip back. Took vehicle back to dealership. They were aware of the problem and used tsb fix for this problem. I talked to the finance manager and he said he was in the process of backing out a deal because of this very same problem and when asked if they couldn't fix it what would happen? I was told they'd have to get us into something else. The fix was to re-calibrated the recycle switch to turn off upon heavy acceleration. The problem is we live in Arizona, to use max ac, the recycle feature has to be on. Took vehicle back to dealership for this problem and other items needing fixed. Was informed by dealership service writer, he had contacted Ford tech, currently there's no fix for the known problem. Purchased a co tester. Accelerating (65 to 75mph) up steep inclines and on some lower inclines at higher speed and passing, tested with meter and had readings from 29ppm to 112ppm. At times staying at 34ppm. My wife has to travel 120 miles round trip, on a weekly basis, that includes the inclines where test results were performed. She picks up our 3 grandchildren from there and also Transport her 84 year old mother to and from the heart and pulmonary specialist at the hospital at that location. My wife also has a heart condition. Exposure to these carbon monoxide fumes are unacceptable. I have photos of the detector with variable readings. There should be absolutely no carbon monoxide coming into the cab of any vehicle for any length of time. It is especially dangerous to my families health, even in small amounts. Ford needs to buy this health hazard back and perform a recall. We are headed to the dealership[ tomorrow to complain once again.-Lake Havasu City, AZ, USA","555":"Car has stalled twice in traffic..one instance traveling 65 mph on interstate... other time while making a left turn in traffic...both times collisions were barely avoided.

I was able to get the car to accelerate normally and decided to try and get to the next exit. I was able to cross to the right lanes but the same thing happened and was not able to make it to the exit but at least I was on the right shoulder. My opinion is that this issue could be a big hazard.

Engine was running rough (sounded like a tractor) and could not accelerate. Dash lights came on. Vehicle was able to coast to an exit ramp where it was towed to the dealership to have the throttle body replaced. Mileage was just over 7,000. It is sad that I had to rescue my family (wife, 4 month old baby, 3 year old and 6 year old) off a busy highway exit ramp when the vehicle is less than 6 months old. The tow truck driver said he gets about 3 or 4 of the same issue with new Explorer a week.

Seventeen hours later the dealership called and a part had been found. We returned and picked up our Explorer but today do not have 'peace of mind' that this will never happen again. Our greatest fear is the next time we could be on a busy freeway and cause a serious accident or deaths while 'limping' to the shoulder or exit. We truly believe that every Ford Explorer owner who goes through this defective etb replacement hassle should be offered an extended warranty agreement. The 2009-2013 Ford owners(1,600,000 of them) with throttle body failures received warranty coverage for 10 years or 150,000 miles.

They claimed it was some weird exhaust flow problem. It was kinda fixed. I think it is the turbos as it only happens when you are hard on the accelerator such as up hill merge onto a highway ...I think I will invite a consumer reporter to go for a ride with their cameraman and see if they agree with me. Other than this rather significant problem, i really love the 2016. Its much better than the 2015 due to huge improvement in headlight brightness, interior quality, tactile controls on center console ... better exhaust tuning.","575":"Noticed oil leak on my driveway.

They replaced the Throttle Position Sensor after the first incident and it worked normally for about two months. The Explorer will suddenly stop as you are driving as the accelerator loses it's function. The engine will start revving on it's on, sputtering, and other odd things. Once you coast out of traffic and get pulled over, you can turn the engine off and restart it. Don't try to drive it as the problem is reoccurring and you may not be as lucky getting pulled over safely the second time. I called Ford Roadside Assistance this time to have it towed. They said that a tow truck would be there within an hour. After an hour and fifteen minutes, I received an automated call to check if the tow truck had arrived and after replying no, I was transferred to a customer service rep who told me it would be another thirty minutes. They were supposed to tow it to Rockwall Ford which is the local dealership.

After speaking with them, my wife called Detroit and complained that it was unacceptable and that it needed to be done faster. Within days, they got it fixed. Needless to say, only 600 miles and one month later, the truck is back at the dealership after experiencing the same issue as last time... This issue is dangerous cause both times the transmission died while moving at a high rate of speed and not being able to get out of the way of other vehicles on the road... This failure is going to cause an accident where someone may get seriously hurt or killed. I'm currently trying to give them their truck back cause it is unreliable and is putting my family at risk...","580":"Heading out and on a freeway on ramp vehicle stumbled and then over rev'ed.

Ford Service Manager says the only thing they can find on the computer is where the engine revved. Supposedly has been driving the vehicle daily without being able to replicate the problem. Wanted to send me home without the problem being fixed. I advised the vehicle was not going anywhere until the problem was fixed. The issue has gone on now for a week.

All I could do was coast then once the momentum stop I was able to go about 3 mph. Thanks FORD.After a call to the Ford help people they say they can send a tow truck but the wait is about 90 mins. So I waited on the side of the road, turned off the engine then turned it back on. It struggled to turn on but when it did the wrench was gone. The check engine light was on but I was able to drive it home. So I made an appointment for the tow truck to come pick it up on Monday August 8th and take it to Hassett Ford in Wantagh. After reading similar stories on this and other forums I am guessing if there isn't a recall. There probably should be before someone dies in a motor vehicle accidents due to this issue which they're saying might be the throttle body.

No room in the lot for vehicles. I was checked in and i explained that i was driving and then i got the check engine and the wrench. I also said i wanted to wait for a diagnosis and could they provide a loaner if it was going to be more than 1 day. Well they told me i cant wait and it could take a day or two but they would drop me off at home. I said that was unacceptable , please let me speak with the manager. I spoke with Bob Pace, manager on duty. very cold, didnt care to hear me out and said \"see all these tickets, what gives you special treatment, we will call you in a day or two. What a freakin looser. Could care less about customer service. I immediately got on the phone and called Ford corporate and after a a back and forth I told them I want to go somewhere else can you call Sayville ford which was 15 miles away. They did and i took my car off that line and drove with my check engine light the 15 miles to Sayville ford. I was just there for an oil change. They immediately took me in and within 1 hour I was done. New electronic throttle body unit and a car wash, Talk about excellent customer service. So i highly recommend Sayville ford on sunrise highway in Suffolk county and Hassett ford of wantagh kiss my **s.

(50 MPH speed limit). I \"limped\" home and called a tow truck to have it towed to my local Ford dealership. I was told by the service technician based on the \"symptoms\" I told him that it was the Electronic throttle body and that they've have A LOT of 2016 Explorers come in with the same exact problem and that Ford is aware of the problem. Really? Ford is aware of the problem but refuses to issue a recall!!! Guess it's all about the almighty dollar to them.I thank God this happened to me on a Saturday afternoon and not during the week when I'm on busy Los Angeles freeways! Someone is going to be seriously hurt or killed (If it hasn't happened already) because of this throttle body issue. Luckily the dealership already had the part in stock and hopefully fixed the issue\/ THEN- on August 4, 2016, I go to start the Explorer to head to work when it hesitated to start. All screens and dash were black, then I get a \"blind spot fault\" warning and \"cross traffic fault\" warning. So, I turned the engine off and then on again and it appeared all systems were go. ALSO, my USB and power ports have been without power for about the last 3 weeks.I'm literally scared to drive this thing. Every time I get in it, I wonder if it's going to break down on me again (and where) and what the problem will be now. I WILL NEVER, LEASE OR PURCHASE A FORD PRODUCT AGAIN. Honest to God. Never again.

So, they're going to have it for a week and have to take the bottom half of the transmission off to replace the sensors.  Seriously, THIS IS THE WORST VEHICLE EVER!!!!  I will NEVER lease or purchase a Ford again.  For the amount I pay on this thing every month it should be working with absolutely NO problems.  Does Ford even quality control their vehicles?!

When I did get if off the road and turned the vehicle off and restarted, it acted like it was running fine. Then it did the same thing two more times and I was able to finally get it to a gas station and called Ford roadside assistance and it had to be towed. I waited two hours on the tow truck. This should not be happening with a brand new vehicle. Reading on here, it is obviously a problem with Ford. Not leaving a good taste in my mouth that they are aware of a problem that is stranding their motorists in dangerous situations.","588":"I was driving on I-26 last night going to meet my son when, I felt a slight jerk and then the wrench light appeared and the Check engine light also came up.

I was close to my exit so I just coasted off the interstate and was lucky enough to catch a green light and turned and made it to a side road. I have had this vehicle since Nov. 2015 and this is the 2nd issue that I have experienced. (First one is cosmetic issue with the dash bubbling).

Talking to one of the service guys, he proceeds to tell me that this is the 5th or 6th one in the last week or two that has come in with this issue.  Not what I was wanting to hear, especially with a new 2016 vehicle.Now I am stuck with a little fiesta as a loaner.","589":"This is Some BullShit that after 8 months the engine light came on. You don't expect to have any problems with a Brand New Car for a few years. smdh. My next car will probably be a Foreign One.","590":"I bought this vehicle as a Ford Certified vehicle. I took it to Florida recently and it had about 25K miles on it. It stalled and died a few times in Florida the day before I was planning on driving back to Oklahoma. I had the car towed to a dealership that couldn't find the problem. They did inform me that my Explorer had already had the Throttle Body replaced back in Feb 2016. Then last month my car stalled but this time I received \"System Off to Save Battery\". I took the car in, and come to find out my battery was about dead. The dealership replaced the battery and check the alternator. I'm hopeful this has fixed the problem. Yesterday (7\/6\/17) my car, stalls again, and I receive the \"System Off to Save Battery\" message. II got the car started and since I was by an Autozone, I pulled in there and had them check the battery. I suspected maybe the alternator, and my new battery was already drained. This was NOT the case. The battery and alternator check out good. So I take my car to the dealership, and they put me in a rental. Time will tell. Hopefully they find the problem but because it isn't storing a code, the dealership is having trouble believing it is the Throttle Body since it was just replaced 5 months ago. I'll keep you posted. I really want this to be fixed because I really love my Explorer. I just need it to not die in the middle of the road. I've been lucky, but I can image if it happened merging into traffic.Update from Jul 18, 2017:One week ago Ford called and said my car is fixed, and we have replaced the Throttle Body.  (Note:  This is the second Throttle Body to be replaced.)  I was very happy and optimistic.  I pick the car up, begin to drive it home, and within 10 miles of the shop, it died again.  Seriously!  So it goes back to the shop.  They test and drive it for another few days and send me home saying they can't recreate the problem.  Now in my mind, I'm thinking maybe they just don't believe me that it is dying.    So I take it home and the next day it dies twice, and the day after that it dies twice.  I was able to film with my iPhone those stalls 3 of the 4 times.  Now I have proof that I'm going to be able to take back to the dealership.  Yesterday I met with the dealership service and showed the videos and they said they always believed me, but they just couldn't replicate the issue and it wasn't saving any codes.  They promised they would find it, and believed it was electrical in Nature.  RESULT -->  I received a call stating they fixed my car and that it was a pin failure in the fuse box.  Fuse #33 for PTC and they were 100% certain because every time you even touched the fuse, the engine would stall.  Moral of the story, wiggle your fuses first to see if it might be something simple.  Only time will tell, as I'm going to pick up my Explorer after work today.","591":"The engine died while driving on the highway trying to get home. Lost all acceleration. Wrench + \"Check Manual\" light came on. Tried shutting off and restarting the engine but it did not work. We ended up coasting home. Will be taking it to a mechanic tomorrow.","592":"While running errands yesterday, I turned onto the highway when my engine immediately died, a wrench light and airbag light came on and said \"check manual\". I pulled over, turned off the car then turned it back on and made it back to work. I forgot to mention it to my husband later that night and the next day it happened again while he was driving. It's terrifying. Does someone have to die before Ford owns up this is a known issue? I did try to check the manual, funny enough, and there is nothing about sudden engine failure with confusing commands listed.","593":"Issue is still being reviewed; but, based on reports from others experiencing same issue the problem is throttle body. Will have to see what Ford will do for the issue since this is being reported by a number of individuals. Concerning due to dealing with engine.","594":"Second time my 2016 Explorer with 8800 miles has stalled on the road. First time I was almost hit making a left hand turn when my car stalled in the center of the road. Today it stalled on I-44 while driving 65 MPH. Car following me was barely able to stop in time to keep from rear-ending me. I have received the recall notice16B32 to replace the e throttle body. I had already had my selling dealer order the replacement and am scheduled to have it replaced in 2 days. I don't think Ford realizes how dangerous this situation is and it will be a miracle if someone is not seriously injured on killed when their car stalls. Previously my family have owned three different Escapes, all three of them having to have their throttle bodies replaced. Evidently Ford has not discovered how to successfully manufacture a throttle body! I wonder if this replacement throttle body is identical to the one they are removing, or is it an improved version. I will never trust this Explorer again and mywife is refusing to drive it to work, choosing to drive her smaller Chevrolet instead.","595":"Brand new, stalled on Rt 1 mid morning. The engine stalled and would not accelerate. Engine light turned on. Had to coast to parking lot and cut traffic to get there. Have children that are little, so very scary. Dealership knew right away what it might be and replaced the throttle body. On to Complaint #2 on same problem.","596":"Call stalled out at light while trying to turn a legal left at a green for all light, no arrow. Car sputtered and then would not accelerate through the light. Vehicle was a sitting duck and could have been hit while not moving in the intersection. Floored the accelerator pedal continuously and it would not budge. After the 5th attempt, just let it sit for a 2-3 second window and tried again. Finally moved~! NO engine light came on like the last time it happened. Brought the explorer to the dealership and they did not help because of the fact the warning system did not catch the stall out, which I think is BS! No resolution has been found with this problem and I think even though this happened to me the first time and the warning light came on, they changed the throttle body- I think there is something a miss with the system. If you have children, do not buy and risk it.","597":"engine light on and the explorer stalled.New ford 2016 should not stall on highway!Update from Nov 13, 2016:This is the our third Ford Explorer we bought new from Ford. I hope this problem of engine shutting off is fixed now.","598":"Car broke down while driving 20mph and Ford first insisted on \"reprogramming\" the throttle body first. As I was driving home from the dealer, the car stalled again at 65mph. Extremely dangerous situation. Then Ford instructed the dealer to replace the throttle body. That was 2 weeks ago and I have driven 500 miles since then and the car just stalled again with the same problem. I will be investigating NY lemon laws.","599":"Driving in Orange county at normal freeway speed in the left (fast) lane, lost power - no throttle response.Orange message on cluster panel \"See Manual\". Coasted to fast lane shoulder (so fun!) put it in park. Restarted on off we went without any other problems,or warnings or messages. No disaster, but could have been ash*ttyheadline on the news about that one family that died! Recall needs to be issued regarding this if in fact a faulty electronic throttle body \/ sensor. Keeping quiet about a problem like this is not the helping anybody...c'mon Ford, cowboy up!","600":"After driving from North Carolina to Maryland, I was driving down a city street and suddenly my Explorer stopped moving. I had to coast into a parking lot. Luckily I was not on interstate 95 or 495. I hate to think what would have happened. I just bought my Explorer in May, 2016. I am now reading that this problem (throttle body) from other owners of the Explorer. I am really surprised that Ford has not proactively fixed the issue. I hate to say that something really bad will have to happen for Ford to move on this issue. I do not feel good about this vehicle.","601":"Driving out of my neighborhood and the engine stalled. The car did not turn off it just topped moving forward as if the throttle didn't working anymore. I was able to drive in reverse of the ideal of the vehicle down my neighborhood back to my house. I call ford an set up a tow for the next day. I was able to start the car again and when I put it in drive I was able to give it gas once more, but this time I did not leave my driveway as I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road.","602":"Last Friday, my wife was driving in town and the car conked out while making a turn (this is the second time this has happened) blocking traffic at a major intersection. The instant loss of power while driving is a real safety hazard. I asked about Lemon Law and was told that the same problem must occur 3 times before the factory would even consider it. The dealer said this was not a common occurance which, based on this forum is not true.","603":"We had a 2004 Ford Explorer with the V8 and it ran until almost 250,000 with only oil changes. This 2016 with a V6 made it to a little over 8,000 and dropped dead while my wife was merging onto a highway with 2 friends. No warning, it just lost all power. The wrench symbol, and engine, light came on. A semi just missed killing them all.The Explorer just drifted off the highway onto the shoulder with no control.One of her friends called her husband who knew immediately what was the problem. He told my wife to let it sit a few minutes and try to start it. It did start and she drove it home about a mile. Once home I did a quick Internet search and found the problem was a throttle body. Ford has known about this problem all along and has done nothing to correct it I saw in repeated complaints.Tonight around 11 PM we are going to attempt to drive the thing to the dealership where we purchased it. I am leaving a message that I expect a loaner car since they almost killed my wife and her friends. Tomorrow I plan to go there and hope I don't get hassle.","604":"While on vacation driving through a national preserve in northern Alabama, lost power and gas pedal became unresponsive. Engine light, wrench light and air bag lights came on. Had to have it towed to dealer.","605":"Our 2016 Ford Explorer lost power in the middle of a crowded highway. We were lucky to be able to move carefully to the side of the road, although it wasn't without several idiots road raging us in the process. We were basically stranded on the roadside 300 miles from home on a Sunday afternoon when all Ford dealerships in the area were closed. Roadside Assistance would ONLY get us a tow truck and nothing else.We were left on the roadside with our luggage while we waited for a cab to take us to the nearest car rental place; all, which we had to arrange ourselves WITH NO HELP FROM FORD. It took 3 days to get the car fixed. Our total out of pocket cost for rental car and cab fare (so we could continue our trip) was over $300. Our ESP reimbursed us for $136 of it.Seems like with Ford knowing this was a MAJOR PROBLEM in its vehicles, it would accommodate requests for reasonable reimbursement. I've exhausted all appeals with Ford Roadside Assistance and Ford Warranty for full reimbursement. I'm very disappointed to say the least. I also have a 2015 Ford F-150 Lariat that I'm told will also have the same throttle body problem eventually, but Ford will not do anything about it until I break down, like we did in my wife's 2016 Explorer.I've spent nearly $100,000 on 2 Ford vehicles in the past year. I'm just disappointed, that's all I can say. I'm hoping the dealership will do its best to help me. For everyone's safety, Ford should issue the recall for this.","606":"I was driving home at 10:00 a.m. after visiting a doctor's office on a busy highway at 57 mph when all of a sudden the car gas peddle is not working. The car is in complete shut down mode. I rolled through an intersection to get to safety. The car dash board had a wrench picture and engine light on and the message was 'SEE MANUAL\". I was not able to go nowhere. I called Ford at 10:06 for a tow and was told it would take an hour to get to me. I called again at 11L30 due to still waiting for the tow truck and was told there was no record of me calling. Customer service had to start from scratch to get a tow truck out to me. Finally at about 12:30 a tow truck arrived and towed me to Sam Gallaway Ford Dealership in Ft. Myers FL.It has been a nightmare since. I was told the part is the throttle body and it would take some time to get the part and that Sam Gallaway would pay 9 days of my rental and then my insurance would have to cover the rest.I do not want this vehicle anymore. I am terrified from what happened and what could happen in the future. This car needs to be on the RECALL list.","607":"Just hit 6660 miles when my Explore lost power.... maybe that's my sign. Anyways at 6660 mile driving on the 210 FWY, my new Explorer lost power, it coasted to the to the nearest exit. It eventually turned back on, got back on the road and drove home. The next day I took the truck to Ford, they first told me it would take a day to diagnose the problem and since it was not in for a recall they could not provide me a loaner. So, I was forced to rent a car. I got a call from the dealership before end the day to tell me the throttle assembly need to be replace and was under warranty and as a courtesy they would cover my rental... oh how nice. Today they call me told me that the unit is on back order by 10days. Really holy !@$ I took me months to convince my wife to by a Ford and not a Toyota. I don't think that Explore will make it back to my driveway after this. Just saying my Highlander would hit 200000 by now with no issues. Which sucks FORD just lost any chances of my wife buying another car from them. FYI this issue has been happening since 2013 with the Escape NHTSA let Ford call it a \"customer satisfaction issue\" even do there have been 1.5 million complains about the ETA. Not looking good I think we will most likely cut our looses and look for another car. I bet you the replacement unit is the same unit. F@#$ ay","608":"Was driving at 60 mph when the car suddenly slowed to 5 mph. The wrench light, air bag and service engine light came on. I had to cross three lanes of traffic of the 5 lanes I was on as I could. The emergency vehicle pulled in behind me and I explained what happened. I shut it down and he said if it would start and I could make it to the next exit he would follow. My wife was scared to death. Eventually I was able to limp the vehicle to the next exit where I could take the back roads to my home. It could have been a serious accident and we could have been stranded and my wife and I cannot walk any distance at all due to health issues. I will be contacting my fleet company to direct me on what to do next.Ford has issues on this vehicle because there are a lot of other issues. I am scheduled to take it in on June 3rd to replace the drive seat as the cloth is coming apart. In addition, you shut it down and it starts back up. It will not start cooling for 5 minutes just to name a few.I have no idea what it will take to fix it but will be taking it in as this just happened about an hour ago. I started reading these posts and had to report this on this 2016 Ford Explorer XLT with under 10k miles.","609":"Driving on Route 4 during pm rush hour traffic going 65 mph; engine completely stalls, no gas, no ac; warning light comes on dash with a wrench symbol, review manual, click ok; look up manual and it states drivetrain\/4WD contact dealership immediately! Seriously?? The vehicle is brand new, only 6700 miles on it! Coasted over to a turn lane, luckily I didn't get hit!Called dealership then called Ford Roadside Assistance. Tow company was there within 30 minutes. Dealership says Ford doesn't cover loaners\/rentals; ITS A BRAND NEW VEHICLE PEOPLE!!! Read that this is happening all over the place with the Explorers and it appears to be the Electric Throttle Body and that the part has been on back order!!! Ford needs to do a recall!!!!!","610":"I was pulling out onto a major road with my 13 year old son and the power suddenly dropped to nothing. I quickly pulled the limping truck at 2 mph onto a side road and turn the truck off. I restarted the truck and it still was rumbling, shaking and wouldn't go faster than 5 mph. The truck limped into a bank parking lot and it was running so rough. I called Roadside Assistance and the went for a tow service. The tow service came about 2.5 hours after the call and towed it to the nearest dealer, not where I bought the truck and trust the service department. This happened on a Friday afternoon, about 4 and it is now Monday and they still have not looked at the truck. But the service manager did tell me that he believes he knows the part he needs and will order it so I can get my truck back.Update from Aug 3, 2016:The dealer did replace the throttle body in my Explorer. He knew what the problem was by my explanation of the events.Truck runs like a champ, hope it never happens again!","611":"Heading home after work with my wife's Explorer, pulled away from traffic light and lost all power, engine still running, but even with foot all the way to the floor, the vehicle was just barely moving. Was able to get over to side of road, shut off, waited a few minutes and then tried starting again, seems to work okay, not sure what problem was, just know it was very inconvient","612":"Left the house with wife and grand kids, turned from one street to another made the turn went about 20 feet and the car just died, stepped on fuel and nothing, could hear the engine running but no power at all with foot to the floor. Wrench light came on and my wife said that something came up about check the manual, but I was too busy trying to get the car out of the lane of travel before somebody ran into me. Thank God it was a quiet day for traffic or it may have been a bad accident. Got it over to side of road, shut it off, let it sit for a few minutes and tried to start to see if it would move, worked okay, made appointment at localFord Dealer and they said because I shut it off and started it back up they couldn't tell what the problem was. Wanted me to leave it for a week or so, to see if they could find the problem, as according to them this is the first time they have ever heard of this and their is nothing in Ford Canada's system about it. Starting to think I should have stayed with Chrysler\/Dodge, not impressed one bit.","613":"The car suddenly lost all power during the driving, I barely move car to the shoulder. the is wrench light on. I turned off the car and restarted it (it took few tries to restart the car.) The car can be started by with engine light on. I drove the car to the dealer next Monday and they told me the replaced the throttle body. I have a friend has the same 2016 ford explorer and met the same issue. I think Ford known it problem and just don't want to take any action. I feel disappoint with ford since I have brought this car to dealers 3 times within one year.","614":"Was traveling on I-96 at 60-65 MPH fairly heavy traffic in the left center lane. The wrench light and check in light came on and loss of acceleration. Luckily was able to move to the left shoulder without incident. The engine was running very rough and I shut the engine off. The wrench light message gave a message to check manual. I started to call for roadside service and was on hold for a short amount of time. I hung up and tried to start the car as I was approximately a mile from the next exit. I was able to start the car. The wrench light was off but the check engine light remained on. I was able to get the car to accelerate normally and decided to try and get to the next exit. I was able to cross to the right lanes but the same thing happened and was not able to make it to the exit but at least I was on the right shoulder.My opinion is that this issue could be a big hazard. I was fortunate to have traffic that was light enough to allow me to maneuver but if this were to happen while making a left hand turn across traffic, heavy traffic or close following traffic this could have been a bad accident.Will update when fixed. It was dropped off on Wednesday night, dealership did not get to it Thursday and it is now Friday afternoon.","615":"Purchased this vehicle in July of 2016. Ran good for 2 months and than every once in awhile you would go to pass someone or try to enter the freeway from the on ramp and nothing. The engine stays running at idle but no acceleration. As you play with the accelerator it spits and sputters and than will eventually accelerate. This has probably happened about 6-8 times now. Have taken to the Dealer with no satisfaction, all they tell you is can't duplicate condition and no codes stored. This is a dangerous problem that Ford needs to address, but I'm sure because there aren't a lot of complaints they're going to wait till someone dies in an accident before they investigate the problem.","616":"Purchased in January 2016. Explorer currently has just under 6,000 miles. While driving approximately 35 miles an hour on a busy road in San Antonio the vehicle power shut down. A wrench light came on asking that we read the manual. We were almost hit by another vehicle. My husband turned the key off and then on twice only to gain the ability to move forward at about 5 miles per hour. We got off the busy road and onto a side street. We were almost hit again by a huge truck. It was horrifying. He turned the vehicle off a third time. When he turned the key to start, the vehicle did come back on to full power although service lights were now on panel.Did research only to find the exact diagnosis of a defective throttle body that seems to be an ongoing problem with this vehicle. We took the vehicle into the Ford dealer and told him about the numerous complaints on this site. The manager said it had happened to him as well with his wife and children in the car. We asked about how many vehicles have had this problem and he said approximately 20%. We asked about a recall on the part? He said there was none because not all of the vehicles have this problem. I was not comfortable with that answer. Does Ford not realize that this is a seriously dangerous situation? Will someone have to die (if they haven't already) before Ford recalls?The manager at Ford agreed that there should be a recall. He also said Ford would have to see if it was a computer problem first. I demanded they replace the throttle body and they did. We're picking up the car today and I'm hoping never to have the problem again, however, I'm not sure I'm going to feel completely safe in this car. I am taking this problem a step further by writing to Ford headquarters and to the United States Office of Consumer Affairs (I believe is authority over them) to document this serious issue. I also recommend you do the same if it's happened to you. Thank you for this site. It's very informative.","617":"Driving at highway speed when suddenly my 2016 Explorer lost power when I attempted to pass another vehicle. My instrument display lit up and read something like \"Terrain management system fault - check owners manual\" message on left hand side LCD cluster. This message stayed lit for under a minute and was replaced with a little orange wrench. Anyway, its Friday morning and I was able to limp 25 miles back to my dealer where they took all of my information and sent me on my merry way.Well that Friday afternoon I received a call from Ron, the service department manager, who advised me that a \"Snap Ring\" within the transmission had failed and that the transmission had to be broken down and repaired.Anyway, in reading all of the different problems with Ford and there many engine issues my problem seemed to be more like a \"Throttle Body\" failure. Hopefully I get my explorer back next week but only time will tell.","618":"EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!!!!! The car SUDDENLY LOSES POWER!!!!(new car--purchased in November 2015---CURRENT mileage on odometer: 6287)","619":"So we purchased our Explorer January 1st 2016. We have since had the throttle body replaced and the transmission fixed leaving it in the shop for a total of 60 days. On top of that the dealership scratched the truck both times we brought it in for an oil change. That took a total of 15 days for paint both times. We have since contacted Ford and filed a complaint. They have agreed to buy the vehicle back and reimburse us for all the payments we have made as well as pay the vehicle loan off completely. We will be returning the vehicle to the dealership this month and will buy a different vehicle. The issues with the truck has been a major pain, but we feel as if Ford has stepped up to make it right for us.","620":"I was driving and the yellow wrench light went on and my engine lost power. The car was running, but it would not accelerate. Luckily I was on a side street a few houses away from home. It had to be towed to the dealership. I will find out the results tomorrow.","621":"Car began chugging and lugging, especially when pulling hills at approx. 1000 miles. Took to a dealership and they replaced the throttle body. Problem has decreased but still remains. It acts like a standard transmission vehicle and feels like the RPMs are not high enough to pull, because when I have it in sport mode and keep the RPMs above 2000, it doesn't do it, or at least I can't feel it. I've noticed that the transmission shifts very early, never higher than 2000 rpms, and remains around 1500-1800 rpms when driving. That seems low to me but I'm not a mechanic. I just want this problem fixed!! It's a huge annoyance and I wonder when its going to completely crap out on me. No engine light so far, and I'm taking back to dealer for re-inspection. Hopefully Ford will get theirsh*ttogether and fix the problem!! Brand new 50k dollar vehicle!","622":"Traveling north on the Loop 101 at approx. 72 MPH when the car suddenly decelerated to about 20 MPH. Engine light came on with the wrench stating that I need to read the manual and the airbag light came on. Well have to ever tried to maneuver through three lanes of traffic going over 70 MPH and they want you to read the manual!! I called Ford Roadside assistance. What a waste of time!! Took an hour and a half to finally have a tow truck appear.You pay $50,000 for a vehicle and it breaks down after 10,000 miles and then they don't even care about getting you the help you need. It's in the shop today so I am waiting for them to call and tell me if they have found anything. Then they give me this little Fiesta to drive. It's like driving a skateboard. Can't even fit in the dam thing. I can see that there are many notices about this same issue.","623":"My car is shutting off acceleration everyday on the way to and from work during rush hour traffic at speeds above 65 mph. I have to try not to crash and pull over the side of the road. Yesterday the dealership performed a software update they hoped would fix it. It didn't. Today they are test driving it to see if it is the throttle control part or something else. I am scared to drive it and wish I could just sink the money I have lost on paying for it the past couple of months and get my Jeep I traded in back. Very dangerous and disruptive.","624":"My wife was trying to pick up the kids from 2 different schools, miles apart, and then bring the kids to her mom's house to watch them while my wife went back to work. This left my wife stranded and we had to call a tow truck, get towed in, get a rental car from the dealership. The worst part is this was just the beginning of the issues. I bought a brand new car so I wouldn't have to worry about my wife being stranded with the kids and the brand new car had less than 4,000 miles.","625":"While driving through Kalamazoo. MI at rush hour on I-94, we suddenly lost engine speed. We had to glide to the expressway shoulder at 5 mph......VERY unsafe for all. We count our blessings that no one was hurt. The powertrain fault (wrench) light was illuminated along with check owners manual. The engine\/transmission would only permit us to limp along at 5 mph. We were extremely fortunate to be near an exit, so we limped along to a gas station. We called Ford Roadside Assistance and arranged a tow to Zeigler Lincoln in Kalamazoo. We only have great things to say about Zeigler....very professional and helpful--a real class outfit. It was late in the day, so Zeigler helped us arrange a rental vehicle with which to get home (we live in Ann Arbor about 100 miles away). Zeigler called the next day and informed us they changed out a defective throttle body and the Explorer was fixed (again, only great things to say about Zeigler!). We picked up the Explorer and it has been fine since.We keep hearing and reading chatter about Explorer throttle body problems and possible issues with associated software. IS THIS PROBLEM TRULY FIXED OR DO WE RISK GOING THROUGH THIS AGAIN?? My wife has a trip to Chicago this coming week and no way will I let her drive this Explorer until we feel confident this doesn't recur. We leased this vehicle with the likelihood that we would buy it at the end of the lease, but purchasing this vehicle is not an option now.","626":"Driving in rush hour traffic with my 6 month old daughter my engine just shut off in the middle lane. A wrench light and seat belt warning came on and my suv stalled. My brand new 2016 Ford Explorer that I specifically leased for the safety of my daughter almost got both of us killed. I am furious, I had a great Buick prior with no issues and traded it in for this Explorer. I looked into my options since I am not scared to death to drive in it and I am basically screwed. The tow truck which was covered took me to the closest Ford dealer, they of course had no loaners, so now I am without a car and super stressed. After reading many reviews online, this problem seems to keep occurring, Ford needs to do a recall.","627":"Driving alone in an area with poor cell coverage, heard a noise, like a pop, the car immediately lost power. It felt like my gas supply got cut off. The \"wrench\" light message came on as did the front air bag light. At this time, the engine was rough running & loud. I pulled over and turned the engine off. I waited a minute & started the car, only to feel the car running rough and loud. Now the \"engine\" and the \"front air bag\" light came on and stayed on, the \"wrench\" light disappeared. I shut the car off, walked 2 miles towards home until I got cell reception to call home. Forty-five minutes later my husband rescued me. The Explorer started up, he drove it home (8 miles) with the \"engine\" light on and it ran fine. The \"engine\" light is still on.","628":"Driving on busy highway at 60 mph with young grandchildren when lost power. Almost killed ourselves making way to the shoulder of the road with cars swerving around us. Problem was throttle body which, as I have learned through research, is a perpetual problem for Ford vehicles. The dealer was good about replacing the part right away and at no cost, but the part is the same one which was subject to failure. Just spoke with customer service at Ford and I am extremely disappointed that they are not more pro-active about making this part more reliable and mitigating the risk of drivers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","629":"My new 2016 Ford Explorer suddenly cut the engine power while driving, it was late at night, glad I had my husband with me-- pulled over to shoulder to re-start engine-- this happened about 3 times while trying to get home. Took it to the Ford dealer first thing in the am-- the check-engine light was on but it didn't cut out. I am awaiting the response from the dealer.","630":"Exact same problem the others are complaining about - 6 month old car & wrench light comes on out of no where then engine light and car loses all power and needs to be towed. Ford Towing was a joke - they wanted to take it to a dealer that was 27 miles away while we wanted to go where we bought it that was only 9 miles away. They said WE would have to pay $109 if \"we\" chose where to take it. Declined that. Luckily we also had AAA but why should we have had to use that. Problem was throttle body as everyone else said. Really disappointed to see all the complaints about this problem. The kicker is that I traded a 2013 Ford Escape in to get this car because that car was a lemon and had recall after recall & problem after problem. This had better not be starting again or I am getting a lawyer this time. I always trusted Ford but now this is getting ridiculous.","631":"Driving down the road at 55 I lost throttle no response when pushing on accelator. I took vehicle to dealer they gave me a loaner. On Monday they diagnosed it as a throttle body. This is the 3rd time the car has been in the shop with electrical issues. 1st time rear hatch module shorted out 2nd time rear seat module shorted out now throttle body and rear air. This is the first and last time I will buy a ford. You spend $45000 on a new car and in 4 months the car has been in the shop 4 times for electrical issues. I am requesting a new car under Lemon Law statue. Please spread the word to all explorer owners to be careful of this problem, and call ford customer relations so they will do something about the throttle body before someone gets hurt or killed. The number is 1800-392-3673","632":"I have a brand new Ford Explorer with under 6,000 miles on it. Driving on the highway pregnant with twins and my 2 yr old in the back seat and out of no where the car goes into like a neutral mode. Unable to accelerate past 20mpg, wrench light comes on, check engine light, and airbag light. Horrified, I was able to pull to the side of the highway. After letting the car \"rest\" for approx. 10min car started up fine, all lights disappeared and car drive fine. Happened again on a side road the next day. This could have killed me and my family. Brought it to the Ford dealership and they were \"aware\" of a throttle issue. I left with a rental car. I don't want this vehicle, I am scared for the safety of my family. When is Ford going to issue a recall? After someone dies??","633":"BIG WRENCH WARNING. I'm adding to the other 46 complaints on this exact topic - time for a recall Ford. Driving on a busy highway, rush hour, Washington, DC and my vehicle decelerated with nothing from pressing the gas pedal while coming down a hill at about 55 mph. Thank God, there was an exit into a neighbor hood and an empty parking space immediately in the community. I had the BIG WRENCH and read my manual sign on my dash. Manual was home for safe keeping. I pull in and seem to have all power - the RPMs were jumping all over. Scared half to death I called my husband. Turned vehicle fully off, waited a minute turned it on and the same BIG WRENCH read my manual sign. Again turn it off, open gas door in case of a vapor lock. Wait a few minutes and try again. Now the CHECK ENGINE light is on but otherwise it seems OK. Now, how do I get home ?? I'm not going on a main highway so I get to the first exit and head for the back roads - Good darn thing I did. 5 minutes later the exact same deceleration happens with no gas pedal or speed. I coast to the shoulder and wait. Try again, and I'm off. 2 miles down the road - you guessed it.....I'm dead again. Now I'm really getting nervous because I have 1 major intersection that cannot be avoided to get home. Praying I'm not in a crash. On phone telling husband this thing has to get to the dealer. I made it home. Looked in manual for the BIG WRENCH...it's not in the manual. Waste of time. On to the internet and I find this group of not similar but identical problems. I literally broke down 3 times in less than 10 miles. Reading these complaints I'm not 100% confident the dealer will fix the vehicle properly. Scared because we are leaving in a week for a road trip family vacation. I researched and did all my homework before buying my Explorer, hoping it wasn't a big mistake I can't afford to take the loss of selling but I don't want to be in an accident. Taking car in tomorrow (Saturday) or (Monday) at the latest.","634":"I was driving to work going about 60 mph on a main road when all of a sudden my vehicle felt like it went out of gear and started slowing down. I could not accelerate at all. I was able to pull over. I parked for a few minutes with the car off and then after I turned it back on the check engine light came on and I could drive again. Not something you would expect from a brand new vehicle!","635":"I guess I'll go ahead and add mine to the rapidly growing list of dissatisfied 2016 Ford Explorer owners, who have experienced the \"Wrench of Death\" along with the engine light, the loss of the gas pedal doing what should be the most basic function of a car, and the perplexion that goes along with being broken down on the side of the road in a BRAND NEW CAR.I was driving along the highway, when I suddenly noticed that the car was slowing down, and the gas pedal did nothing. With the weight of the car being the only reason why I was still moving forward, I looked at the instrument panel, and observed a giant orange wrench with the words, \"See Owners Manual\".Luckily, I was almost out in the sticks and was able to coast onto a side road and come to a stop. The engine was still running, the electronics continued to function, yet, I did notice that the tachometer was indicating RPMs which looked like the car was having a seizure. After letting off of the brake pedal, the car inched forward normally, as is the case with all cars equipped with automatic transmissions.Because the display panel told me to, I opened my owners manual and attempted to locate information about this problem. Do not bother opening the owner's manual. There's nothing there for you.I turned off the engine and turned it back on. Nothing changed. I turned off the engine again. I lit up a cigarette, systematically went down the entire list of the 4-letter words I learned from the Army, and finished smoking. Then, I turned the engine back on again, and to my surprise, the accelerator functioned normally. It takes me about 2 minutes to fully smoke a cigarette.I then stopped what I was doing, and drove the car straight to the dealership where we had bought it. They were \"kind enough\" to drive me home. I say this, because even though Ford had screwed me royally, I was still at their mercy, and not vise versa. Unfortunately, however, Ford did not decide to grace me with a temporary replacement vehicle, despite the fact that they had an entire lot full of vehicles, just sitting there.This is when I learned that these Ford mechanics don't work on Fridays. Everyone else on the planet does. But not them. Seemingly, Ford has chosen to smile upon them, and frown upon me. And so, our 2016 Ford Explorer will have sat in the parking spot where I left it for 3 1\/2 days, before it is . . . explored.We thought that as the car is sitting there, ashamed and lonely, this would be a great time to assess its value. To our dismay, after paying $42,000 of our hard-earned savings, now the car is worth roughly $24,000. This means that getting rid of this car, would be the equivalent of cheerfully walking into the Ford dealership, writing them a check for $18,000, for nothing, and then leaving.We have decided that this is the \"best\" option, when considering that the alternative option, is the likelihood of dying in this car. Given that Ford is very well aware of this problem and has not issued a safety recall, I can only surmise that our deaths in a 2016 Ford Explorer is what it would take to convince them that a recall is necessary. (Editorial note: It won't be me or my family)If you know anyone who owns a 2016 Ford Explorer, the best thing in the world that you can do for them, is to pour sugar into their gas tank. It very well could save their life\/lives, and they will thank you for it later. Screw this car, screw this company, and screw the people who run it.","636":"I was driving down the highway when the explorer downshifted, the wrench light came on and lost the ability to accelerate. I was driving 65 mph and luckily there was an exit right away with a gas station. I pulled over, turned off car, got gas because I was almost empty and it seemed to be working ok. I drove a few miles down the road and the same thing happened. Took it to the shop and 2 days later they said it was the throttle body that needed to be replaced.","637":"My senior parents were driving their fairly new (purchased brand new 6 months ago) Explorer on I-66 at over 65MPH when the car decelerated to 10MPH! My mother was able to pull over to the shoulder, turned the engine off, restarted the engine, and were able to drive to the mall with no problems. On their way home the same thing happened again! They were driving on a major\/busy road but were luckily able to pull into a commercial lot and get their Explorer towed to the dealer. The vehicle is there now. We've lost all confidence in Ford, more so now that we've read all of these complaints! How can they know that this is happening and not do anything about it!?! In my opinion this is just as bad as the Toyota issue with brakes!","638":"gas pedal stopped working....check engine and wrench symbolDriving 50 mph in 2016 Explorer (9 months old & 8000 miles) and all of a sudden gas pedal doesn't work, lose power. Seriously! Thankfully, I was able to glide the car off the road on a busy highway. The check engine light appeared and a wrench symbol (which basically means you have a problem). I pushed on the gas pedal and nothing. My care was paralyzed. What a helpless feeling. I had it towed to Ford on Saturday and had to wait until Monday. I was told that that on Ford's internal messaging system there was a known \"service message\" regarding this exact issue. When I pressed the service guy I spoke with, he said it was a known issue but was not a \"recall\". Really, seems pretty dangerous and a serious accident is going to occur. Imagine if I was merging or thought I could pull out and make a left turn and then nothing.....deadly consequences. I had my 9 year old in the back and thankfully we were safe. The service guy told me on Monday that my electronic throttle needed reprogrammed. Ok, seemed reasonable, Ford knows what they are doing and would never let me leave without resolving the problem. I then googled my scenario and was shocked at other customer experiences and how similar they were----EXACT same story.But it gets better. I left the dealership on Monday, 9\/19\/16 and felt good. Ford knows what they are doing, right? On Friday, 4 days later, the EXACT same thing happened AGAIN. I was extremely lucky and in a park area at a stop sign. This time, I was able to drive the car and park it. The wrench symbol did come on but not the check engine light. So I had it towed...again and now had to rent a vehicle and wait until Monday. When I spoke with Ford Friday before they closed, they were Surprised this occurred. Obviously, their attempt to \"reprogram\" was futile and put my life and my family's at risk.Needless to say they better be prepared for me on Monday, 9\/26.","639":"Driving home Wednesday evening 0ct 5 on interstate 29 approx 75 mph when my car jerked and the wrench light came on with \"SEE MANUEL\" and my car lost power. I pulled off on the shoulder and then tried to drive forward nothing, so I turned off the car and tried to restart. Car started now the check engine light is on, tried yo move forward nothing. Repeated this process 2 more times and on the third try the car did start to move so I continued to drive and limped home. The engine sounded rough and the car jerked once in a while. Took it into the Ford dealership in Fargo ND next day. They said the computer just had to be reprogrammed.","640":"Oct 7th driving on my way to a wedding driving 60 mph when the car jerked and wrench light with \"SEE MANUEL\" comes on again! Just had the car in the dealership on the 5th for the same problem! I bought this vehicle brand new in December of last year because I need something I can depend on, I travel an hour to work each day and live where the climate can change drastically in an hour. Coming up on the winter months I don't need this to happen to me when it is 20 below zero with a wind chill of 30 below! This is not an inexpensive vehicle and I don't have the means to buy another one so someone better get it right. I called the dealership again and they are having me bring it back. But after looking at the Internet this seems to be a ongoing problem, maybe a recall needs to be done!","641":"Bought this car February 2016. Suddenly the wrench light came up and was not able to accelerate. Turned off the car for 10 minutes and Turn it on again and the light was off. Will take the care to dealership today in order to be inspected. Very disappointed at the car as Paid so much money for a new car and this happens. Keep everyone posted on the outcomes.","642":"2016 ford explorer check engine light, wrench and air bag light came on all at once and I lost total power. had to pull over and re-start 5 times just to get the truck back home. Truck was towed to dealer and they are saying there was just a recall for a power control module. but from all the complaints I am reading it is the throttle body that needs replacing. this is the 2nd time this has happened to me and the first time they told me it was sensors that got wet.","643":"My wife drove this 2016 Explorer for about 10 months and put only 5500 miles on it. A couple weeks ago, the vehicle lost power in the middle of a busy intersection. Luckily, she was able to pull to the side of the road without being clobbered by another car. The now infamous \"wrench\" light came on and the vehicle would only idle at about 2 mph. No response to the gas pedal at all. We had the vehicle towed to the Ford dealer. They told us it was a issue with the software that controls the electronic throttle. The dealer flashed some new control code and called it good (\"16B32D Reprogram PCM using IDS release 102.02 or higher\"). The vehicle has exhibited some strange quirks, like an erratic idle at stop lights, since getting the new software. Took it back to the dealer, but they insist it can take up to 500 miles before the computer learns our driving style again and that it will start performing normal sooner or later. My wife won't drive the vehicle anymore. I don't blame her. What if the vehicle loses power again turning left in front of a semi or trying to pass someone on a two lane road. I've been a Ford man my whole life, but I think that's about to change. Thinking hard about trading in the 2016 Explorer on a 2017 Four Runner, despite having to take a $12,000 bath on the Explorer.","644":"6000 miles new car!!!! It lost power(cannot accelerate) two time in local driving(lucky..). The wrench light and air bag light is on. But after restart the car. Every thing is fine. We went to the dealer. It took two days to fix it. The solution is to replace the throttle body.","645":"Nothing quite like driving home from Lowes on I-95 going 70MPH and having your new car JOLT and then lose power. The Wrench symbol appeared and said \"Check Manual\" and then all power was gone. The Airbag light also lit up. We pulled off into some gas station and restarted the vehicle a few times. Eventually, it allowed the power back on and we managed to drive it home. It was towed out of my driveway this morning to the dealership to be checked. They said they know of the issue and will get back to us with an estimated repair date. AND NOW... though making payments on a new car- i YET AGAIN do not have a car!! (This is the second issue with this vehicle)The entire reason we purchased a new car was so that when traveling with our 18 month old we did not have these types of issues. It is completely unacceptable that you type the problem into google and it is a COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR? why are you selling these vehicles without fixing this problem? If it had been a busier time of day.. we would have easily been in an accident.... Glad Ford Motor Company is really concerned about the safety of their vehicles. We purchased based on safety ratings... perhaps whoever rates them needs to be on this website to see just how NOT SAFE this car really is. How am I supposed to put my baby in the backseat and know this wont occur again??","646":"It's just sad to say that Ford forgot to do some quality control. I was on vacation with my family while cruising along I-295 at 65 MPH when the dreaded wrench light showed up on my dash board and I could not accelerate. Good thing the cars behind me were quite far so I had time to pull over. turned off the engine and restarted the SUV and everything was normal again. We arrived at the hotel safely. the next morning on our way to the family gathering it happened again. luckily I was able to park the SUV. called the service tech from the dealer and explained the issue and without hesitation the service tech answered you must replace the throttle body. He even instructed me to drive up to the nearest Ford Dealer and they would change it immediately. however in VA and on a weekend that's not gonna happen.I called ford road side assistance and was told that the tow truck will arrive around 3pm. I guess the tow truck drivers watch was not set for DST because he came at 4pm and told me that he had just received the call 10 minutes ago. He also had the audacity to tell me that i'm not the only customer around and was hurrying to tow my SUV. now my SUV is in VA and I'm back in PA.Ford can not ship or tow my SUV from one dealer site to another. according to the roadside service I have to pay $460+ to have it towed. McCafferty Ford at Langhorne PA refuses to pay for the towing instead they want me to drive 3 and half hour to Battlefield Ford at Manassas VA to get my SUV. I spoke with Phil the Manager in Langhorne that if they stand behind their product and workmanship they should be able to drive my vehicle down from Manassas VA to Langhorne PA with no problem. again he refused to have my car be driven by one of his drivers. Now I have no car and no rental due to the fact that Phil was waiting for ford to get back to him.I thought he worked for McCafferty Ford? to say that I am frustrated with Ford is an understatement. My SUV is still in Battlefield Ford Manassas VA. I don't think i'm ever going to see it again.","647":"Wife was on the highway on the way home at night when the same thing happened to everyone else. Luckily she didn't get rear ended from the sudden slow down on the highway. If this is a recurring problem (which it seems to be) not sure why more isn't being done to make owners more aware and to bring in to fix the problem.","648":"Same issue as I've been reading ---- this was really annoying considering the car was just built by the factory in December, 2015 (I received it 1st week in Jan 2016). Going along fine, then all of a sudden wrench light and engine light come on and we go into \"limp home mode\". Towed to dealer, they tell me 3 weeks due to part back order. Luckily, and I mean LUCKILY, they agreed to give me a loaner car --- evidently, Ford isn't obligated to do this. The good news, I got my car in 3 days because a shipment of parts came in to the local dealer. Wait it gets better....My Mom & Dad have a 2016 Lincoln (MKZ) and it happened to them going 70 mph on I-95 driving home to Florida. While sitting in the waiting room, the same car gets towed in with the same exact problem. 3 cars I know about within the last 3 weeks. Better not happen to you on a Sunday in the middle of no-where away from home on a vacation or while travelling. One positive, Lincoln has a nice warranty -- they cover your costs (hotel, food, expenses).....Those of us that have Ford warrantee, you are SOL.How many more people need to get affected before Ford\/Lincoln wises up and does a self-induced recall? Oh wait, we won't -- we need to save money. Let's just move our factories to Mexico! Maybe my last Ford.","649":"Driving my 2016 Ford Explorer with 10K miles on lightly travelled back roads (fortunately), when forward momentum suddenly and unexpectedly ceased. Engine seemed to still be running, but nothing happened when applying gas. Wrench indicator came on in display indicating to check owner's manual. Turned engine off and restarted, but vehicle still wouldn't move. Turned off and restarted once again (several cranks before it actually caught this time) and was able to drive home with the vehicle appearing to behave normally except for check engine indicator which was still illuminated. One other observation leading up to this event in the preceding couple of days and which occurred twice was that if I were stopped with my foot on the brake, the car would very subtly appear to want jerk forward - not enough to make me step harder on the brake, but it felt almost as if I got lightly bumped from the rear.Update from Jul 23, 2016:Update 7\/23\/16: Problem was diagnosed as the Electronic throttle body as being defective and as similar to other complaints. Had that not been the diagnosis, I would have pushed for further analysis based on all of the other complaints with the same symptoms. Fortunately for me, my dealer service department (Wall's Ford in Salisbury, MA) had the part in stock, and my Explorer repaired that day. As of this update, vehicle has been performing normally.","650":"On 09\/15\/16 we purchased a 2017 Ford exploreer limited from supreme Ford of slidell, la.

So, after almost three weeks without my brand new car I finally picked it up.It's been approximately 2 weeks and 1k miles later and today all of the same lights came on again, this time accompanied by the \"4 wheel drive not available\" warning and a weird warning coming up on my sync screen that was basically an outline of my car with a red exclamation point in the middle of the top of my vehicle? To say that i'm frustrated would likely be the biggest understatement of the year. Neither the local shop nor the \"experts\" at the Ford \"hotline\" seem to know what they're doing. It's nice to know that they repair vehicles with the same ineptitude that they build them with.....This is why I will NEVER buy a Ford with my own money.

About three hours into five hour drive. Suddenly, without any visual warning (e.g., rock, shard), we hear an *explosion* sound from above, along with the sound of glass clanging everywhere and the rush of highway air. I quickly switch my hazards on, decelerate, and pull off the road as quickly as I can. I noticed that no neighboring vehicles as much as flinched during the incident, nor did anyone stop... as if nothing appeared to have happened externally from their point of view. When we got out to investigate, we saw that the front major pane of the panoramic sunroof had completely shattered center-out, probably about 2sqft of glass missing. Notably, several edges around the newly-formed hole were upturned. Those are all the details I can remember. My very strong belief is that the sunroof exploded without any external debris involved. The position of the cartop carrier relative to the hole, my vehicle's position relative to other cars\/trucks (not terribly close), the fact that I saw no object hurtling toward the vehicle prior to the incident, the fact that no object was found in between the roof and the inner sunshade, the fact that no other cars\/trucks behind me reacted... all the signs point to something simply being wrong with the vehicle.-Chicago, IL, USA","687":"I had to ride in my own backseat for the first time today.

When I finally received a call I was told they were waiting for approval from Kia.I called KIA customer service and they said they waiting for a call from the dealer, called the dealer and they told me KIA denied the repairs. The dealer had asked for proof of maintenance oil changes which I supplied receipts for. According to the dealer the claim was denied by KIA due to sludge found in the engine. After reading other complaints with the same exact problem, it seems that there is a manufactures problem that they are not willing to admit to. Now I am stuck with a vehicle that cannot be driven and fighting back and forth with the dealer and KIA to make the repairs.Update from Sep 21, 2016:I would love to hear from other Kia owners with the same problem to find out how it was resloved.","729":"My KIA was operating with no issues. A few days ago the dash lights, specifically the oil light, began flickering but never stayed on. I thought maybe there might be a short in the light as my vehicle itself was not performing any differently. A day later my car engine began making a slight knocking or clicking noise. But, there were no warning lights on. The noise went away. The next day while driving home I was driving on a highway at 70 mph. The noise returned then quickly became louder and then a horrific metal screeching noise came from under my hood and my vehicle engine completely turned off on me while on the highway. I was able to coax my vehicle safely off the highway. I called KIA they told me it sounded like the recall issues they had been addressing. Within an hour they had a tow truck pick up my vehicle and said they would get back to me.Later that afternoon, the KIA service department called me said my engine is shot and would need to be replaced. Further, it is not under warranty and it is not the engine that is under recall though it meets all the same issues that the engines in the prior years had that had been replaced. He said he would call me back with pricing on engines.Upon the second call, the serviceman advised he sent me pictures and advised that there was \"sludge\" in my oil and that my engine was not a manufacturing problem, but a maintenance problem. I told him that was impossible as I have maintained all the maintenance on the vehicle on schedule. In fact, the oil had just been changed three weeks ago! He told me there was no way my oil would like that if I changed my oil three weeks ago.","730":"My 2015 Kia Sorento only has a little over 25K miles and it is smoking & bucking under hard acceleration. It has also used 5 quarts of oil in the last 3 weeks. By the time the oil light came on, there was no oil showing on the dipstick. Also no \"check engine\" light.Took it to the dealer on Monday and within minutes told me the engine had severe engine sludge, the engine would need to be replaced and warranty wouldn't cover it. They did not do a compression test to determine the problem and told me if I wanted one done I would have to pay for it. I had a complete inspection & oil change done in March and they said everything was fine, no mention of sludge.In reading other horror stories about the GDI engines and sludge buildup, I am thinking the 2015 should also be included in the recall. This car has been well taken care of and any sludge is not as a result of neglected maintenance. I've had this car for 8 months and only put 5K miles on it.","731":"When shopping for a new car, checked JD Power ratings, reviews and thought that Kia was it. Purchases our 2015 Sorento on 12\/31\/16, car had 38,000 miles. Fast forward to April 2, 2017 barely 3 months-husband drives it to NC (300 miles or so) and calls me to ask have I had any work done on it. Nope, I say. I drive it 20 miles to the airport and back once a week to commute to work and locally for errands and thats it. He says it sounds like a diesel. Takes it to a service station and there's no oil! Puts in 4 quarts and drives back to Richmond and it burns 2 quarts on the way.Now this is a car with LOW mileage at purchase, very clean inside and under the hood. Take it to our local Kia here in RIchmond and they say \"it has sludge\" we need service records. Mind you its still under warranty. Its not time for an oil change, they did it at the dealership where we purchased it and we barely have 3000 miles on it.We get service record information from previous owner, and they are not complete enough so they are not going to fix it. Previous years 2011-2014 are under recall FOR THE SAME THING! SLUDGE IN THE ENGINES!! THESE CARS ARE P.O.S's!!!","732":"if you need to buy a new car please don't buy kia. there warranty sucks. they will denied you of any big thing. I need it my engine replace and they denied you even with all the receipts of service. I will sue them for bad service and fraud.","733":"This problem was very nerve racking. We did have excellent service from Kia corporate and the local dealer, as well as our dealer back home. We were driving at highway speed and were over 300 km away from home, so it was pretty nightmarish. Luckily we had just come in to cell service, so were able to call road side assistance. They are replacing the engine and covering our rental car in the mean time. Even though Kia has been excellent about helping us, I just wanted everyone to know about this potential problem I recommend that you get all service done at the dealer and make sure to check your oil regularly and pay close attention to the clarity of your oil and make sure there are no metal filings on your dip stick. Other than Engine failure, we have really loved this vehicle.","734":"2015 Kia Sorrento 2.4 L, regular oil changes at home every 3 months, at 38,000 miles I started hearing a slight knocking sound which got louder and louder. Had last oil change less than a month before the knocking started. Drove to the dealer, he knew right on the spot what was wrong with vehicle. Talked to a gentlemen at a local Auto Parts store and his brother who is a mechanic at the Kia dealership sees 2 to 3 similar engine failures a week with the 2.4 L engine. Showed paperwork of Oil changes which I do at home and waiting to hear my fate. From everything I'm reading online, not to hopeful that Kia will help out but will let you know. I certainly don't have the money to pay for a new engine on a lease vehicle and just praying Kia backs up their engine","735":"I purchased my 2015 Kia Sorento in Januray of 2015 (1.5 years ago). When I purchased the Sorento it had 8,001 miles on it. \nFast forward to April 2016. I got an oil change as I normally do within every 5,000 miles as required with the warranty. A couple days after the oil change the car started making very strange sounds and the oil can light flickering (which based on the manual states \"low oil pressure\"). I brought the vehicle back to the Mobil 1 who completed my oil change a couple days prior and explained the issue. They stated \"sometimes with these new cars the computers don't register when the oil is full\", he proceeded to add half a quart of oil and told me I should be fine. This sounding odd to me I called Kia to bring my car in for an inspect and to replace my coolant hose because there was a puncture in it.I bring it in and they fix the hose along with doing an inspection. I told them exactly what the problem was and what the car was doing. The next day they called to tell me they inspected the car and found no issues (I have the inspection paper stating this) and they replaced the hose. I had to pay for the hose because the puncture was caused by an animal and the warranty doesn't cover that.I leave the dealership thinking my car is in good working condition as the dealership told me.\nFast forward 1.5 months...now we are into June. I am driving my family to the movies and I hear the strange sound again when I get to 40 mph and the oil light flickers. Its Friday at around 10 pm which means the dealership is obviously closed but I was ready to call them again in the morning.As I am driving home and going up a bridge my car justsh*tsoff when I am half way up. I begin rolling down the bridge BACKWARDS into oncoming traffic. Luckily it was late so the roads were not packed but there 5-6 vehicles who were coming up the bridge were able to maneuver around my vehicle avoiding a collision.I am then on the side of the road and call AAA. They get my car on the flatbed and he brings me to the SAME dealership I purchased the vehicle at my request. We leave the Car there and I write them a note regarding the issue that took place AGAIN.They call me and say they will look into it. 5 days later they tell me my car is back running and ready for me to pick up. I asked them what the issue was and he said \"The Starter...and we replaced it for you\". I'm not a mechanic but I am also NOT an idiot! A Starter WILL NOT cause you to LOSE POWER AND GO BACKWARDS DOWN A BRIDGE!! I told them that was acceptable and I would not be picking up a hazardous vehicle and putting my family's lives at risk. He says \"oh let me call you back\".Two days later calls me back to say there is something wrong with the engine and they need me to authorize them to \"tear it down for $135\"....I authorize because I figured the warranty would cover it once they discovered what the issue was.They told me they found \"sludge\" in my engine and the \"correct filter\" was not used which caused damage to the engine. They said it was Mobil 1's fault and the warranty would not cover the damages. After I told them I was told I could get oil changes anywhere and the manual does not a specific filter that must be used. They told me they need to have my oil change receipts. So I go digging for the receipts over the past year and a half. I go to Mobil 1 and have them reprint my last two most recent ones and I searched for more since I know I got them at least every 5.000 miles. They send in the claim with the two receipts and the claim gets denied due to \"not enough receipts\". \nI find two more and send them to them. At this point they have receipts for at least every 5,000 miles (which is required by the warranty apparently). So now I am waiting for a response from corporate on the final verdict with the additional receipts. \nOh...and to tell you how terrible and unethical the people at Napleton Kia off Northlake Blvd in Riveria Beach are... when the service manager tells me the warranty claim got denied I asked him what I should do. He says \"you should sell it to another dealership or private sell it since its running and let it be their problem\" WOW! Probably what those jerks did to me! \nI will NOT back down and I WILL NOT allow them to bully me or force me to pay roughly $8,000 for a new engine!","736":"Defective lower balljoints caused a rough ride.

Sitting in the front passenger seat is uncomfortable for me (arm rest height, windshield visibility, etc.) without the small pillow. I cannot believe there is no way to disconnect the sensor (which I was told was weight sensitive....obviously not, because my weight is the same with or without the pillow). This leaves me without air bag protection or else uncomfortable. Had I known this in advance, I would not have purchased this vehicle. Not all people are the same height (I'm 5'3\"...not all that short) and if Kia was putting in this system, they should have made the front passenger seat height adjustable...doesn't have to be electric, just adjustable in height.

This is my fourth Kia Sorento, I have owned a 2005, 2011, 2015 and now a 2016. I have a had great luck with them and since I like my wife's 2015 I decided to trade in my car and get another one. Every since I purchased it the steering wheel has been slightly off to the right which drives me crazy!!!! I am a visual person so I decided to take it to the dealer and have an alignment done on it (Approximately 1,700 miles). The four wheel alignment confirmed that the alignment was off, but the steering wheel was still of center. The service adviser informed me it was because of the road crowns which I know is not true. I drove the vehicle for several hundred miles after the alignment and the problem is still there (I just wanted to make sure it is the vehicle and not me getting adjusted to it since I drove a sports sedan prior to this Sorento). I have been in the automotive industry for several years and I work for a tire company now so I know a little bit about automotive repairs. After doing some research it appears that the steering wheel angle sensor needs calibrated, but the dealership doesn't even have an alignment machine so they sent my Sorento to a Chevy Dealership. I called the Kia \"Customer Care\" line and spoke to a man that did have an answer to my questions and kept saying that he would get back to me. I am not one to post online complaints, but this is getting silly and unprofessional. All I want is to drive my car without having problems and fighting the steering wheel while I am driving.

Car going for dealer diagnosis today..Here is the issue: with cruise control for example set at 62 MPH engine RPM is like 1975 RPM and coasting down a hill -- all of a sudden you notice the car picking up speed because it's going down a decline or a hill -- the engine RPM becomes erratic with the needle hitting 1000 RPM and then to 3000 RPM and then back down to 2500 RPM and as your coasting down the hill you can feel the auto controls slowing the car down trying to keep the speed at 62 miles per hour but as you look at the RPM again you are now descending at a steady 5000 RPM and you still notice the system trying to do the braking as your traveling down the hill.Something wrong here -- This is so not normal and I don't want to blow the engine. This doesn't even happy on both my Fords (Escape and F150).. On a flat surface or going up a hill the cruise control seems to be performing just fine.

On a flat surface or going up a hill the cruise control seems to be performing just fine. I now have around 400 miles on the vehicle and wanted to do a couple more tests. The two other tests going down a hill produced the same results. I was informed by dealer to refrain from using the cruise control today and hopefully the car will be fixed this Saturday on 05\/23\/2015. We both love our new cars and I'm confidant this minor glitch will get fixed under warranty.Update from Jul 7, 2015:After taking the 2016 Kia Sorento back to the service department we went out on a trip with a Kia certified specialist technician . We proceeded up Chesterfield hill Route 9 from Keene NH towards Brattleboro VT. With cruise control on, we started the uphill climb with the engine speed around 3500 RPM and up from 1650 RPM. I can see why the RPM is elevated -- we are climbing about 60 miles per hour in a lower gear -- down from 6th speed gear. Upon reaching the summit and the car finally leveling off  we start another decent downwards and the grade couldn't of been more than 4 or 5 percent and the engine RPM hits 5000 RPM for the entire downward decent for about 45 seconds. Red line is 6500 RPM and the car isn't even broken in. The Special trained factory Kia Sorento technician said this isn't right but he understands the problem. He says that Kia switched the on-board  ECM computer logic software to enable the engine to do all the breaking rather than the transmission to hold back this 3500 pound Kia Sorento. So my thought is now blow the engine and not the transmission. So in the nutshell Kia is letting the engine do the breaking rather than the transmission just like in the trucking industry. We then headed back to the dealership and I demanded they get a hold of corporate Kia service department to give me a letter in writing of some explanation. The answer back from Kia was under no circumstances are you to use cruise control upon approaching or descending an incline or decline greater than 6 degrees. The interstates are full of ups and downs so they basically don't want us to use cruise control here in the Green Mountains of Vermont or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The tech also said that one of the major reasons for this switch is to save on fuel.\nI must not understand something or am just ignorant. How can one save on fuel when the engine RPM speed is racing out of control at 5000 RPM and I assume you must be in 1st or 2nd gear to cause the RPM's to spike.\nThe Kia tech finally admitted that Kia will most likely change the ECM computer logic board programming. This was just his thought and or opinion. The tech said he would reprogram the 2016 Kia Sorento back to original factory specifications and let the vehicle start my driving habits again. So as of that last dealer visit I just don't use my cruise control very much. I want this vehicle to last since I'm now retired and don't want to blow the engine or transmission.Update from May 31, 2016:To the individual, Chris M. who sent me an email asking if I am still having the same problem as to erratic cruise control. I now have around 22,000 miles on my Kia Sorento and the problem was never fixed and I am still having the same problem. So here is my answer. I still use cruise control all the time and when I am ready to approach a decline I turn cruise control off traveling down or up a hill and then resuming cruise control.","798":"[xxx] 2016 Kia Sorento (VIN # [xxx]) sunroof exploded while on interstate 55 northbound in jackson, ms on 10-21-15 at approx. 8:30pm cst with no traffic or obstructions or overheads.

I cannot believe there is no way to disconnect the sensor (which I was told was weight sensitive....obviously not, because my weight is the same with or without the pillow).

I went to another KIA dealer and the first time there they said they replaced the radio. No difference in sound. I returned to that dealer and their solution was to listen to other Sorento radios and because there was no tone control on them either, there is nothing that can be done about it. One of their techs even told me I should listen to FM instead. DUH!!! The programs I listen to are not on FM.

When my Kia service garage contacted Kia about my problem, Kia's answer was as follows - under no circumstances are you to use cruise control upon approaching or descending an incline or decline greater than 6 degrees. I live outside of Pittsburgh, PA and need I tell you that this statement means I can hardly use my cruise control at all.

On a flat surface or going up a hill the cruise control seems to be performing okay. My Sorento had 8200 miles on it when I finally unloaded it. But after months of waiting for a Kia representative to talk with me at the dealer, and after he and I took my Sorento and a new 2017 Sorento (which did the SAME thing) out for a test drive, I was being told that \"this is the way this Kia functions and nothing is going to be changed on it at this time\". I use my cruise control often, and this was NOT ACCEPTABLE! So, I took a BIG loss and unloaded it.

On four occasions, while driving with smart cruise control, on a highway on a clear day, my Kia's dashboard lit up with \"check smart cruise control system.\" These additional warning lights lit up on the dashboard: Anti-lock brake warning light, electronic brake force distribution system warning light, master warning light, and electronic stability control indicator light. The cruise control will not work and all lights stay on until the vehicle is turned off and then back on. After one occurrence, I took the vehicle to the dealer to diagnose the problem. As this only happens randomly they were not able to replicate the problem. The vehicle was also not storing any diagnostic codes. After the 3rd time it was in the dealer for the same issue they said a code was stored. They said it had something to do with the camera mounted on the top of the windshield. The service tech disconnected and reconnected the camera with the thought that it might be a loose connection. The same issue happened again after they adjusted the camera.

My Kia stops autonomously most of the time, but not all of the time. On three occasions, while driving with smart cruise control, on a straight road on a clear day, my Kia slowed down but did not stop, causing me to take emergency evasive action at the last second.

The problem continued so I called the dealer where I leased the vehicle (785 miles on it at this point). They said to bring it in. It is more than 50 miles from where I live to them. There is another dealer within two miles, they said I could take it there, March 20, 2017. I was at 1,005 miles at this point because I had to travel for business over the weekend. The dealer I took it to took two days to diagnose the problem. The oil pump failed and the engine was full of metal pieces. The fix, replace the engine. This is the fourth KIA I have owned and it may be the last. I have contacted KIA customer support and they were not much help. I suggested that because it has been less than 30 days and the problem started around 500 miles they should replace the vehicle. At trade in time having a remanufactured engine, whether it is good or not, will greatly affect the trade in value. I should not have to suffer financially because of their faulty product.

There were cars slamming on their brakes and swerving to go around me. I was in the left lane of a 3 lane highway and many cars and 18 wheelers began swerving to pass me on the right. It was extremely difficult to coast to the shoulder. The power steering seemed to be limited as well.there were 2 near misses with other cars and it could have been a very bad crash. I turned the vehicle off and back on and made it to my destination. But, this happened a second time on my way home in the dark.

My concern is that this could be a very serious and dangerous problem in some circumstances, such as being in the middle of a high-speed multi-lane turnpike. You can easily imagine being stalled in such an instance and being hit from behind by following traffic. My online research shows this is a problem dating back on Ford vehicles from 2009 at least, and that the NHTSA is 'studying' the problem, but no recall has been issued.

By this time traffic from the other direction was passing me on both sides. I turned the engine off and restarted it, however, when placed in drive the same thing happened.

On 10\/19\/2015 took the car to the dealer and was told the problem would take a few hours to fix. At the end of day was told the headliner needed to be removed and would take the whole day, however, the car would be ready at the end of the day on 10\/20\/2015.At the end of the day on 10\/20\/2015 was told noise coming from air bag \"curtain\", technician was putting everything back together. Then told everything put back together, however, noise still there. On 10\/212015 was told the noise was coming from a factory issue where the sunroof is \"glued\" to the frame and probably not enough glue used. Was told will have a glass person come out on Friday (10\/23\/2015) to \"re-glue\" it. This is a really nice, and expensive car, but the noise is so annoying it gives me a headache to drive it.My biggest concern is that I have researched this \"glueing issue\" on line with older vehicles and that it will no longer appear to be a new car with only 250 miles on it. From what I have researched removing the head liner is a delicate issue, and now apparently the headliner in my brand new Ford Edge Sport has been removed and replaced two times already, and apparently will be removed and replaced a third time before 300 miles!","932":"Electronic throttle body failure.

Was able to pull over to the side of the highway with no acceleration. I was in the slow lane, this could have been a potentially life threating situation if I would have been in a different lane with faster moving traffic. After the car was turned off and then on again, was able to accelerate. Drove about 5 miles to take the vehicle to the dealership and lost acceleration completely again. Purchased new in December 2015, currently has 5222 miles. This is the second issue with the car. The first issue was with the back passenger door. It was not aligned properly and sounded like air was coming in.

Bad news. Not even 24 hours after picking the Edge up it died while merging into I90 at eastgate. I have now owned this car just over 60 days and driven a total 1,900 miles during which it has gone into limp home mode 4 times. Evergreen has reprogrammed the PCM twice. This last time it was in I was told the oil level was too high and caused the motor to shut down. Well the oil level was set to the factory specification by the tech and yet it shut off again today.

Without notice, while in motion and in the middle of traffic, the vehicle shut down; deployed the emergency brakes; and attempted to dial 911. It nearly caused an accident in the middle of a busy intersection. We promptly took the vehicle to the dealership, where they said the issue could not be replicated. The regional representative at Ford customer service stated that if the issue could not be replicated Ford would not be able to do anything else. The vehicle is brand new, with around 3000 miles. We are concerned about the vehicle and Ford's unwillingness to address the issue.-Indian Land, SC, USA","946":"I have accidentally shut off my car while driving mistaking start button for radio button. This was my fault, but this is not a safe feature for any driver. Fortunately this time I was sitting at a traffic light and was able to restart the car.-Saline, MI, USA","947":"I was stopped at a stoplight in clear, warm weather when the engine silently turned itself off. Not realizing this, I attempted to turn, but the Edge was off. Ac and radio remained on. I did not see any warning lights on the dashboard. After a few frantic minutes, I noticed the small green light on the ignition button was flashing. I put car in park and was able to restart engine. We have only driven the car a few times since and no problem. I fear this happening while driving in traffic. Vehicle had 765 miles on it- we had it for 3 weeks.-Fitchburg, WI, USA","948":"We had stopped at a red light and then we proceeded through the light and the transmission shifted hard from 1st to 2nd gear (auto transmission) but didn't think anything about it. We then turned into a parking lot at tampa international airport and the vehicle's engine just shut down before we came to a stop. We coasted into a parking space and the automobile was unresponsive to me trying to shut everything down for approximately 3 to 5 seconds. There was a notification that appeared on the dash when the engine shut down but I don't remember what it said. It then allowed me to depress the start\/stop button that allowed the electrical system to shut down for a re-start. I then restarted the engine and picked up my passenger and drove home. The vehicle has been problem free before the incident and did not cause any problems on our return drive home. We were very lucky to have been in a parking lot and not on a busy highway pulling in front of oncoming traffic.-Bradenton, FL, USA","949":"Drove Edge all day with no problems, then for no reason, the display in dash went blank. No warning lights came on. Could not tell speed, radio would not work, steering was sluggish, vehicle drove rough, front windows would not operate, but rear windows worked.

Couple of weeks later light was still on. I took the car to my nearest dealer and was told my alternator had to be replaced and that I should not drive the car further. I was out of a car for 1 week because parts were not available.-Montebello, CA, USA","951":"This has happened to me twice. Went out to the garage in the morning and the battery is completely dead. After a jump I had the battery tested and it was reported to be fine. So like the other complaints, it's not the battery, it's a slow drain. In both my cases it happened after driving from a night out and I notice the onscreen display doesn't shut down which is an indicator. After the second time I've been cognizant of any signs of power after shutting down.Not long ago, I had a third instance of the same electrical problem after having my headlights on. Despite pulling into the garage, shutting down, and turning off the lights, when I opened the door to get out the audible bell indicator went off as if I had left my headlights on. I had to crank the engine several times and shut down before it eventually went away.In all 3 cases it was after using my headlights. I'm of the opinion it may be tied to the switch\/knob but that's only a guess. I'd be interested to hear from others whether their occurrences were after the headlights were used.","952":"Third time in a year and a half that I've gone into my garage and battery is completely dead. Jumped battery and charge was holding next day. Reported to dealership where they said, if it didn't happen in the shop, they probably couldn't detect or solve problem. Taking to dealership anyway so they can record my complaint.","953":"Jump started it, took into dealer. They could find nothing wrong.","954":"Thought that would fix the problem, but have come out to a completely dead battery twice since.","955":"After the car was picked up from the dealer that evening the following morning my wife went out to go to work but as before the remote didn't work. We immediately call back the dealer, they say bring the car in. Had to pop the lock to get in with the key in the fob and get a jump start since the tow truck driver said he won't be able to get the car on the truck unless he dragged it to how it was park and this could damage the car. So we call the dealer and they say jump start it and drive it on the flat bed. We did that.The car is still in the shop and I call the dealer to ask what was the problem, if it was the battery that need replacement since from before he said the battery was drained. Only to find out he said the battery was good and it was electrical problems that was diagnosed. Hence, they needed a couple days to get it fixed. So I am still waiting to get the car back to see if they fixed the problem.","956":"This is a recall on the throttle body I got the letter in November. However Ford Motor will not replace or buy back this car. Also it is still leaking water onto the passenger side. The company is hiding behind the ALABAMA LEMON LAW. BUT THERE IS A FEDERAL LAW THAT TRUMPS ANY STATE LAW.This is a ford edge brand new car. and I feel like FORD is blaming me by not taking responsibility. Not to mention there is a lawsuit out on the throttle body. CONTACT ME ANY NEW REPORTERS OR NEW MEDIA OUTLETS","957":"Doing 65 mph at 5:20 am in the morning, a lost of power and dash instruments and tools was a very frightening experience on the I-495 beltway, Springfield mixing bowl in Virginia. Glad the vehicle is still under warranty and I had GEICO Insurance to tow me.","958":"I experienced a complete electrical failure as I was turning a corner. Although I managed to guide my car in to an empty bus stop, it was incredibly scary as the light had turned and cars were heading toward me. The wrench light was on, so I shut the car off, waited a minute and turned it back on--no problem. The manual said to go to the nearest dealer, so I did this the next day. My car was put on diagnostics, but the problem was not reproduced. The dealer said there should be a recall \"coming out soon\" but until then, all they could do was \"tweak\" the program. I hope this doesn't occur when I'm driving at 70 miles an hour down the highway: I'm not sure I'll survive that one.....","959":"I was driving 50 on a busy road and all of a sudden my car locked up and the wrench light and air bag light icon came on and the car coasted. I had to get out of the way and it was a busy intersection and very scary. I could of been hit but thankfully I was not. Very scary and not something I have ever experienced with any of my other cars. Especially if they are new.","960":"I had to have to towed. I just got it back from the dealer. Ford Customer care is no help. It is a new car and does not qualify for the buy back or replacement plans. My car as stopped a second time. The first time it was the throttle body. This time the computer. Something about the back hatch was pulling the power. It is not my fault it is a lemon I want a new car. Thinking about a class action suit.","961":"Cross traffic sensors, blind spot sensors, hvac system,  and air bag sensor are not working properly. Its been 3 weeks and they still have no Idea what's wrong. They are just guess now.","962":"Had one as a rental while our other car was in for service. One morning went to unlock it, press on the remote, nothing happens. Pressed every button on the remote and nothing worked. Had to pop the handle cover and use the key to get in. Still, nothing worked. Couldn't unlock any doors, engine wouldn't start, couldn't do anything that involved electrics. It wasn't the remote battery since it would still light up when it was pressed and when a mechanic came he said it wasn't the car battery. Not sure what ended up happening but obviously this was a big problem and can really mess up your schedule.","963":"The contact owns a 2015 Ford Edge. While the contact's dogs were inside the parked vehicle, one of them depressed the park assist button that was located on the center console of the front passenger side of the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle began parking itself and crashed into a fence. No injuries were sustained and a police report was not filed. The contact mentioned that the failure recurred twice. The vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 5,750. The VIN was unavailable.-Rochester, NY, USA","964":"From the date we bought our Ford Edge we have had white particles, dust and dirt coming in from all of the door seals and rear back hatch. The white particles are all through the vehicle. There is a brown dust or dirt on the top of the passenger seat and rear passenger seat and on the head rests for both seats. The dirt and dust makes me cough a lot, ( no one has ever smoked in the car ). it feels like we are inside of a vacuum cleaner disposable bag. We believe none of the seals on any of the doors work properly. When we first got the car, a burning smell was coming from the passenger side of the vehicle. A new exhaust system was put on the car a month after we bought it. That problem with the burning smell went away. We were told by the fourth dealership that we took the vehicle to that all the seals on the doors and back hatch would have to be replaced, but that never came about. So here we sit with all the white dust and dirt. We believe the cabin filters are not working. So the dust and the dirt are also coming in through all of the vents in the vehicle.-Lansing, MI, USA","965":"The door seals are not working. We have white particles and road dirt inside of the vehicle since the day we started driving it. We are getting headaches and coughing a lot if we are in the vehicle for more than a few minutes.-Lansing, MI, USA","966":"The rear tail light on the 2015 Ford Edge sel has developed cracks which leak and cause condensation and water to build up inside the tail light. This creates the potential for a electrical short or fire.-Albuquerque, NM, USA","967":"The driver side carpeting has nothing to hold up the Edge\/top of the carpet above the dead-pedal and obdii port. The carpet has been slowly falling down and replaced once under warranty by Ford. This has not fixed the issue with the top falling down. This can cause serious interference with the driver's feet while operating the pedals. Already there is barely enough room for my foot to rest on the dead pedal already (size 9) without hitting items above the dead-pedal not to mention adding the worry and dangerous falling carpet on the the driver's foot. Ford needs to revisit this and create some attachments to hold the top of the carpet up.-Guyton, GA, USA","968":"Rubber coming off of brand new vehicle door. If I had to guess by the look of the rubber around the rear doors, it will all be a problem. We shall see.","969":"There were paint drips in all of the wheel wells. All of the drips were in excess of 1\/2 inch long. The only way to fix is to repaint the body panel which will lead to issues down the road of blended factory finish with repainted body.","970":"I was standing behind the vehicle putting something in the back and the rear lift gate just started closing on me. There was no safety mechanism to stop it so I had to duck real quick and get out of the way. This happened the beginning of the month and I still have a stiff neck from fighting the lift gate from closing. About 2 weeks ago they were loading tile in the rear of my Edge and again the rear lift gate started closing on him. I yelled at the guy to get out of the way or the lift gate will close on you. He quickly got out of the way before the lift gate closed on him. This is very dangerous since there is no safety mechanism to stop this from closing and someone could get seriously injured.","971":"All of the door seals including rear lift gate have some type of dirt coming in. So there is dirt everywhere in the cabin, on all of the inside door panels. On the dash board. On the seats. On the center console. On the control panel. It feels like we are inside of a vacuum cleaner bag. This problem started with in two days of buying the vehicle. Dealer did not seem to want to do anything about it. A real shame, our last two vehicles were a 2013 Ford Edge with absolutely no problems and a 2010 Ford Escape with absolutely no problems.","972":"Driver's door is hard to close, must try several times. Was told it was supposed to be like that but the other three are not hard to close. Taking to dealer to fix.","973":"After driving the car in the rain, it drips water from the left rear wheel well for two to three days. Makes a complete mess in the garage. Our neighbor called us, told us to check in our garage for a leak because water was running out from under the garage door. The garage door also froze to the floor in the winter and we had to pry it open. First dealer, where bought the car, wouldn't fix it, wouldn't even deal with us. Told us to file under the lemon law. Second dealer was of more help but still no repair and they don't know what to do and Ford engineers have been no help. We know of one owner that has the same problem, their \"fix\" is to leave the car outside of the garage while it is dripping. Problem has been going on since we bought the car in October. Anyone else with this issue?","974":"While driving down the road I noticed water leaking on my shoulder I was not sure what was going on. When I looked up I saw the water it had rained the night before the Ford Edge has racks on top so I assume that is where the water is coming from. Car has been take the dealership its been there for a week.Update from Jun 5, 2017:Water leaking around the handles inside the car on the drivers side Took it to the dealer No problem found","975":"The driver's side and driver's side passenger floor pans were completely soaked. Didn't notice until the driver's side floormat was growing brown mold. According to Ford technicians, water was leaking through the driver's side A pillar.","976":"I brought back my brand new Ford Edge for this \"customer satisfaction program 15B21\" one day after purchasing it. It's been four weeks and I still haven't got it back, and am fighting with Ford Canada for my one month's payment. I should be given the re-imbursment no questions, and then some for the trouble. Not happy with Ford.","977":"Bought a Brand NEW Ford Edge 2015.. Noticed on the test drive there was a lot of moisture on the front windshield and inside the vehicle.. Dealer said more than likely a window left open not to worry.. They asked for a few days to get the 3M done and what not.. Wife picked it up on the Friday.. Carpets soaked, dealer said they had the vehicle detailed and to drive around with windows down and it will dry out.Saturday.. Rest of vehicle dry except for Drivers side.. Threw some towels in hoping to sop it up.. Sunday.. Still soaked (now even worse).. Wife takes it in Monday Morning \"Sorry can't look at it til tomorrow but leave it with us\".. Call Tuesday morning.. \"Sorry no one can look today.. maybe Thursday due to Canada day tomorrow\"... Meanwhile vehicle is SOAKED.. I had enough and started ranting online.. Ford Canada Service reached out saying they would try to help.. Called our Sales rep, he'll see what he can do too.. Fast Forward Thursday.. No one can STILL look at the vehicle.. the only inside guy is busy on a \"big job\".. Maybe tomorrow.. Hello.. Its +30c out.. vehicle soaked.. no one's doing crap.. Drive down to Dealership and raise hell.. All the sudden it becomes a \"We'll look tonight we promise\"..End Result - \"Yes there's a leak\" No(#&@Sherlock.. Ford's aware, and we're working on a fix.It's been a month.. Been told as of yesterday, it could be another 3-4 weeks..

Spoken with Ford Canada \"Customer Service Manager\" Refuse to make my payments or reimburse because they \"Gave you a rental out of good will gesture\"..Frustrated beyond belief as we have a special needs daughter, and are supposed to go on holiday shortly.","978":"Really upset me. I finally get to buy a brand new car and get what I want. I have only had it for 1 1\/2 months. That is really heart breaking, it has been a week and a half and there still waiting on new carpet and parts. You buy a 50,000 dollar car you expect it to last until you get it paid off. I see where they have stopped making the 2015 Ford Edge because of the leak. I don't have a lot of money and share my car payment with my boyfriend, so know I'm scared I'm going to have nothing but problems.","979":"I had my 2015 Edge for 5 days when I went out to move the car and realized the driver's side floorboard was FULL of water. I dropped the car back to the dealership that night. The dealer is trying to rectify the problem and told me Ford had issued a service bulletin(?) about a bad body seal that allows water into the cabin. They have pulled the seat and carpet up to repair the seal, but are not replacing the carpet. As someone who has dealt with flooding I am aware of the potential damage, mold, etc caused by water issues and am unsure how to proceed. I wanted to see if other 2015 Edge owners have had this issue and how they handled it. I'm not sure I want this car back!Update from May 27, 2015:When Ford was called to see how they were handling this problem, their rep said that if the dealership was offering to replace the car for 'just the taxes title, and tags' that they were going above and beyond and we should take it. I think that THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT MY DOING and Ford should provide me with what I paid for- a new car without water damage.The dealership has ordered a new Edge-exactly the same as ours but with the proper seals. They have offered to 'replace' our car with this one, but we will have to pay taxes, titles and tags AGAIN- adding one or two thousand dollars to the price tag. Hey Ford- how about not making ME pay for YOUR screw-up??We should be able to pick it up today, but I'm leaving it there hoping for a resolution. I was hoping (expecting) Ford to make this right. Their solution is to instruct the dealerships to dry the carpet, seal the leak and give it back.","980":"After the service rep looked at it, the plant had to adjust production. I wonder how many unknowing people are getting screwed.","981":"I am extremely disappointed that a brand new car would have the drivers side carpet sopping wet. Taking it to the dealer June 8th.I am concerned about mildew.","982":"The rear glass vista roof panel cracked along the entirety of the glass roof. Cracks all along every Edge of the glass that don't intersect with each other and Ford claims that one area had to be the point of impact. There is no way possible for glass to crack on the opposite end and doesn't intersect with the alleged point of impact for it to have been the cause. I believe the glass is structurally defective and Ford will not cover it under the bumper to bumper warranty we purchased for the vehicle. Ford gives the service manager the authority to deny the warranty, yet had to give the same service manager guidance on how to test the glass. Ford stated I needed to file an insurance claim instead....updated 09\/22\/15 updated 3\/23\/2016-Woodbridge, VA, USA","983":"Just a warning to all: beware buying a first year model or a redesign of an older platform from ANY car company. Buying my 2015 Ford Edge SEL (purchased 05\/20\/15) reinforces that we who purchase them are their guinea pigs! My proof lies in having the A pillar waterproofed AFTER water leaked through it and soaked the driver's side and passenger floor pans so badly that I only noticed the problem when brown mold began growing on the floor mats. My Edge had a little over 1800 miles in less than two months. Ford kept the car over a month in order to replace carpeting, floor mats and wiring harnesses.Approximately a week after getting the car back, the passenger's side windshield wiper stopped while I was driving in a rainstorm (imagine if it had been the driver's wiper). According to the dealership they \"only\" had to tighten the screw that attaches the wiper to the wiper motor. The local dealership has handled this as well as they could, but I'm here to tell you that the national FoMoCo was ill-prepared to deal with problems, took too long in sending parts, and seemed indifferent to my concerns regarding future corrosion, mold and possible electronic malfunctions.","984":"Our sun roof now closes very slowly, so much so that you wonder if it is going to make it all the way closed. We took it to a local dealer and we were told that Ford is aware of the problem but the \"engineers\" have not yet come up with a solution. So now we can't use our sunroof, and we are also concerned that the glass will shatter as in the recently launched class action lawsuit regarding these sunroofs in Ford vehicles. Seems like they are aware of sunroof problems for many years. Very disappointed with the service, this vehicle is under warranty and Ford won't or can't fix our sunroof.","985":"There wasn't anything special happening - No sub-zero temperatures - No rocks or stones - Nobody slamming doors - Nothing preventing the trunk from closing. Then without any warning it just crystalized into a million tiny little pieces. The rear window just shattered for no apparent reason at all. So who is to blame for this?? Do I call my Ford dealership and ask if maybe there is a defect in the back window glass?? Do I make an insurance claim and pay the $500 deductible and face increased rates for the next 4 years when it clearly wasn't an accident?? Do I have to cough up the repair money for something that was not my fault??This sucks!!!","986":"Ready to head home after a day of shopping, just pulled out of the parking spot when we heard a loud boom. I pulled the car back into a parking spot to see what happened, only to realize that my rear windshield shattered for no reason. There was no one around, nothing that had fallen from a building or the sky. My rear windshield shattered from one corner to the other, all the way across the bottom and then the glass continue to crack up the center of the window. Small shards of glass continued to break off and drop on both the outside and inside of my car. Called FORD roadside assistance and was told that no one would accept my service call because they deemed it a liability issue. After several other phone calls and no help, I had to break the rest of the window and then wrap it with a tarp and drive an hour and a half home in 26 degree weather. FORD is not covering it under warranty, my insurance is. Luckily no one was hurt and my dogs were not in the back of the car.","987":"Driving about 40km\/h temp was -4 deg C. Nothing overhead. All of a sudden BOOM. Look in mirror to see my rear window completely shattered. Pulled over ASAP and checked it out. As soon as I shut my door the glass let go and fell into the trunk space. Ford has initially denied coverage but I'm trying to convince them still.","988":"I opened my vista moon roof this weekend to discover that the glass was cracked the entire way front to back. There is no reason this should have happened. Vehicle is garage kept and I park in an open parking lot at work. I called the dealership since I only have 33K miles and it is just under 2 yrs old. I have an appointment next week for them to take pictures and submit to Ford to see if they will cover it under warranty.","989":"Still no official recall on sunroofs! I am hopefully lucky since at 26K still under warranty heading to dealership today for them to take pics and submit to Ford.","990":"Going to Ford dealer 11\/28\/16 to get an opinion. Will ask for warranty repair.,","991":"I opened my sun shade panel and discovered a jagged crack extending from the front to back of the moon roof glass that opens. There is no sign of impact or anything nearby that could have fallen on it. I went into a Ford dealer in Lakewood and was told that he has seen a few of these over the past few months, and Ford knows they have a problem. Because I have over 36,000 miles on my car, he said it would not be covered by warranty. Really? The car is only 16 months old, and Ford is aware there is a problem but, because of my millage I'm on my own with this.

There was no point of impact on the glass and I park in an open parking lot. The car has 6k miles on it... I can't feel the cracks from the inside of the glass, but I'm worried about the structural integrity of the glass. I'm a die hard Ford guy, but I wasn't expecting issues with the car within 1 year of purchase. The glass for the panoramic roof is $1,057 and includes both sections...

Fracture has multiple starting points with no point of impact leading everyone to believe it is either a glass defect or a temperature expansion\/contraction problem. Ford so far has stated they will replace under standard warranty, but glass is not stocked and will take about 1 week to receive in house and then will need to take in for repair. We stuck carpet mastic on the bottom of the glass to prevent shattering until repairs could be made.","995":"Noticed an odd crack in the rear panel of the panoramic sunroof.

Next day was informed it will be covered under warranty but will take several days to ship replacement glass. Thank you Ford for covering it. But...when I googled the issue, it appears to be an ongoing problem with this roof\/window. Seems around 2000 mi. the thing just cracks for no reason, and some are not being covered by the company.

Upon arrival at home\u201a she pointed out that the rear vista glass roof panel had cracked for no apparent reason.We dropped it off at Cowles Ford with the expectation the factory warranty or the additionally purchased extended bumper to bumper warranty would cover the issue. Cowles Ford informed us that Ford Corporate told them over the phone how to \"test\" for an impact area and based on their newly learned \"test\"\u201a they determined it was a rock and an insurance claim instead. I disagreed because there are cracks throughout the entire glass and they do not intersect with the alleged point of impact.I asked my insurer (USAA) to have a claims specialist look in depth as well and she pointed out to the dealer that there are other areas that look the same as their alleged point of impact. They have not been able to answer my questions regarding how can a point of impact on one side of the glass have impacted the numerous other areas cracked as well. Yet despite having no answers\u201a Ford Corporate trusts their newly found expertise to deny the claim at the dealership level. This is disingenous and I won\u2019t stand for it. The dealer needs to back the claim or get Ford to provide a qualified expert that can support why the claim is denied other than a hunch and on-the-job training by phone.","998":"Electronic throttle body failure.

Since I have only had the Edge since March it is very annoying to deal with issues in a new car. We had to have the car towed and the Ford dealership knew exactly the problem. Why hasn't Ford contacted me when they know there is an issue? Do they just wait for you to be stuck on the side of the road and then react? Fortunately I wasn't going 70 miles per hour on the expressway when it just stopped. So is Ford waiting for someone to be hurt before they issue a recall?Ford do the right thing and contact all Edge drivers to let them know of the issue before someone gets hurt!","1047":"The reason I'm writing is that this problem in not new to the Ford Edge (2009-2014 existed) and I have a 2015 Edge with 13,000 miles and a high loan with a car I no longer trust!I was driving up a hill in a left lane on a hwy. going 55 miles per hour with a truck tailgating me when I suddenly lost power.

I immediately placed my blinker on and hoped the truck didn't rear end me while moving to the right lane, and then to the side off the road.Fortunately, I could cross and didn't cause a crash or get crashed by the semi.Very, very sad that Ford has known about this Throttle body air intake (EEC) issue since 2009 and has somehow still not recalled the old models but continue to create new models with the same issue.Damn.

It completely stalled out 3 times prior to this and was taken to a Ford dealer in NJ where they continued to say nothing was wrong with the car. Finally it went into limp mode and all the trouble lights stayed on and back to the dealer it went, where they said now they are changing out the throttle body. One to four weeks to get the part. Unreal! I just hope this is the fix for this headache. otherwise I really enjoy this car.","1051":"I bought my new 2015 Ford Edge in June of 2015, not even 2 months after owning it, the engine died on me while in stop and go traffic. The lights on the dash were on and it gave me an error message but I don't remember what it was. I was able to turn the car off and turn it back on and it was fine. Then it did it again maybe a week later. Took to the deal twice, they contacted Ford and they told the dealership they it had to be reprogrammed, which fixed it but now 9 months later I'm dealing with it again. This time I took a photo of the error message, it said \"Full Accessory Power Active.\" I've taken it back to the dealership but I've done a lot of research and this problem has been happening for years on all kinds of Ford vehicles.","1052":"vehicle stallI purchased my 2015 Ford Edge V6 SE in March 2016. I drive 200+ miles per day. As I was driving home yesterday on the freeway, my Edge stalled while traveling at a speed of about 75+ mph. The engine did not turn off, however, giving it gas was unsuccessful. I pulled over to the side of the road and put it in park. The engine idled very rough. I put it in Drive again, it would coast (as it would if you didn't give it any gas) but stepping on the gas pedal was pointless. I turned the engine off, restarted and it ran normal. My husband made an appointment with the dealer for Friday, 5\/13\/16. I will post the results.","1053":"I purchased the ford edge brand new. It is a 2015. It had problems from the start. But I thought oh its a new car and I was not use to it. However my reality came true on Aug. 5, the car stalled and would not crank. Returned to dealer and told it was fixed. And was told there was a recall on the car but after talking to customer care ford the car has no recalls. I even asked the salesman if there were recall on it. Then I happened again. \nStalled for a second time a Brand new car . I told the dealer I wanted a new car and did not want this one back. The GM is now involved. I told them you can fix the car all you want. It is not dependable anymore. I am going to get a new car and change the law in the process. If u purchase a new car and it stops within 6 months you should be given a new car. If the problem is not your fault. \nSo the dealership is trying to fix it for the second time. However, I have call the corporate office hopefully I will get a new car or my money back. This has now become a safety issue. The people at the dealership clearly cannot fix it. But because of arbitration they have to be given a chance to fix it. This needs to be changed. Customers don't need to feel like they have to sign the arbitration agreement. \nHow many time do I have to let them try to fix it? Can I sue Ford Motor Company? If they buy the car back I will not get the full price. That should not even be a option. Give the customer a full refund the car stopped\/stalled. And I still have to keep paying the payments while they are fixing it. I was given a loaner car. I am expecting a call for corporate on Monday. Also, I can thinking about setting up a petition page on change.org. So I can get the ball rolling on changing the law.Update from Aug 21, 2016:The dealership has replace the throttle body the first time and the ECU the second time. Ford Customer Care informed me that these were 2 different things and the lemon law says has to be same problem. They made it clear. But it is still electrical.

Immediately, upon starting in garage, i would start to put in reverse and it wasn't started. So I would have to restart it. Being new to this keyless start, I assumed I just didn't do something properly, but a wrench symbol would show up until I restarted it. Then, about a month ago, I was pulling up to stop on our Lane. The car lost power. It showed \"full power accessory on\". I had to put car in park and restart. Now, again, just last week, November 28th, I was driving down our lane with my son in car, and it lost power again. Luckily no one was behind us. Radio was still on. But nothing happened when I pushed gas pedal. Again, I had to put in park and restart. Same warning came up after it happened \"full power accessory on\". This time we called Dealer. Initially they said they couldn't get to it until the following Tuesday. We told them I wasn't driving this death trap, nor putting my family in it and demanded they provide us rental until they could get it in. After reading the numerous complaints on here, I learned that it was the throttle body and that many were having problems getting it diagnosed, fixed. And even if they were fortunate to have them put a throttle body on, it didn't fix problem. They provided a rental. I wouldn't drive the 55 miles to pick up rental so my husband did. Then amazingly although they initially couldn't get it in until the following Tuesday, they got to it the next day. They drove it. Nothing happened. They put it on machine but no codes showed up. But they got permission because it sounded like a bad throttle body, to put new one on. Then I had to go pick death trap up. I talked with Owner, who said they replaced the part even though it didn't do it for them. I said for them to keep it a month, put their family in it and see if it would do it. I told them that everything I read said this wouldn't fix it because 1) they are either replacing faulty parts with faulty parts, or 2) They don't really know what the problem is although the same problem happened with various models of theirs from 08-13. And all they did then was increase warranty to 150,000 miles. The National Car Commission was pushing for them to recall but kinda left everyone out in cold. I was then told that since they didn't anticipate this problem with future fords- they didn't put codes in for it. Well how convenient is that? And why would you not anticipate it when you never really resolved the problem with the 08-13 various models. Bottom line, they offered to give me what I owe on it toward a trade with them after reminding me that I was angry with Ford, not them, and I would be getting survey to fill out about them. I look around and tell Owner, he is a Ford dealership. He feeds his family by selling their deadly vehicles. How anyone can sleep at night knowing that, I haven't a clue. I would rather work at a 5 Star selling gas, etc for less money and be able to sleep at night. Anyway, we don't want another Ford. We took our car to another lot and they offered us more than what we owe. Going to start an arbitration I guess. Who knows when this will happen again. I may be on interstate next time driving 70 with Semis on my tail. Until we trade, however, I am going to get a clear sign screen printed to put on back windshield warning drivers that my car dies at any speed without warning, leaving me dead in road so please, for their safety and ours, don't follow too closely because the manufacturer doesn't know, nor care, yet again with this problem they have had in numerous other vehicles in past. I've learned a lot about Ford though. They had huge lawsuit where they had to pay 18 billion and then turn around and borrow 15 billion to get out of. They apparently don't care. Apparently someone has to die before they will do the right thing. We aren't going to be their statistics.Update from Feb 21, 2017:UPDATE:  Traded death trap.  Feel so much more comfortable now.  I wasn't going to go through Fords arbitration process with my family at risk.  After all, they said they couldn't detect problem but replaced part that was supposed to \"fix it\".  Through with Fords.  Such a shame too because otherwise I loved this Edge and my previous '08 Edge that I had no problems with.  It's because of that 08 Edge that I wanted another.  But I see more big problems coming for Ford.","1055":"Like other folks have posted on here, I have been experiencing (randomly) periods where all of a sudden and out of the blue, the car dies. I have never experienced it while driving, it generally happens when I am stopped at a light (or stop sign) or backing up. I've had it at the dealers on 4 separate occassions where all they tell me is that no code is being thrown. I finally got fed up with it last Friday when it started happening again. I finally got ahold of the GM at the dealership and expressed my frustration over the lack of getting this fixed, especially since this site came up in a search in like 2 seconds. He told me he would get to the bottom of it, sure enough, they had me bring the car back in, and now they are telling me they are going to replace the part (like everyone else). I'm curious though, has this fix helped everyone having the issue, or do you continue to suffer from this?The other thing I noticed (not sure if it has anything to do with it or not), last weekend when we pulled in to an Ace Hardware, I locked the car and went shopping. When we came back out, the fob was un-responsive, wouldn't open the doors, nothing. Fortunately we were at Ace, so the guy replaced the batteries, but according to the owner's manual, if the FOB runs low on battery, I should have gotten a message on my panel. No message, no notification, just dead. I was wondering if anyone thinks that may be playing a role in the car dying as well, if the FOB can't communicate with the car, what happens to the car, does it just turn off???Update from Mar 31, 2017:I agree with the other folks, Ford should have made this known before I bought the car.  I would like to add my complaint to the others for any pending litigation.","1056":"WE BOUGHT THE CAR USED IN OCTOBER 2016. ONLY HAD 8,600 MILES ON IT.

I called the dealer who said I'd just need to call roadside assistance and have it towed in. While on the phone with roadside assistance, I tried to start it again and lo and behold it did start.Dealer said they had an update for that problem, they reset the computer.

Was told it normally takes a couple of weeks to get that part but, I was \u201cin luck\u201d as they had one in stock.After reading all the complaints on this site, it is evident that this is a concerning problem and that Ford should be proactive and recall and replace this part.

I went to Ford Motors directly and a regional manager at least was able to arrange for a rental as I live in a rural area and car was under warranty and they could not immediately diagnose the problem, so they said.....after 8 days of back and forth they said \"unless we can duplicate the problem, we can't fix it\". In almost every report I read, the throttle body needs replaced, however due to my quick thinking that I would like to live to see another day, by starting the car in neutral it apparently cleared the computer of the incident.The regional manager told me that they could put a black box, similar to a flight recorder in the car so if it did this again, they could diagnose this issue, she left out the part about how the dealer then tries to get ME to give them a 500.00 deposit and I am told that in order to use this \"black box\" I would have to hit the trigger when the incident occurs so the Ford engineers who don't know how to correct this problem can have some data!

My husband wanted me to be safer in a bigger and safer car, so we decided to try an American car so we went with the Ford Edge. Luckily, my husband had been using the car because he needed a bigger car for carpooling.On Thursday August 4, 2016 he picked me up from work and we were on the #2 lane on the freeway and the car just turned off. Fortunately, there was traffic so we were not going too fast. I was horrified and could not believe this was happening. Thank God we were able to pull safely over to the side of the freeway and that I was not driving alone. The message we got was \"Hill Start Not Available\". He started the car up again and died again as he drove to the next exit. Once again he started it and he was able to get off the freeway and again it turned off.We decided to call for a tow truck and have it towed to Sunrise Ford where we leased the car. We waited 2 hours for the horrible tow truck service and once we made it to the dealer and asked for a loaner car we were told they wouldn't be able to accommodate us because the rental car place they deal with was closed, so we should call an Uber. We left the car for the whole weekend and got a call on Monday the 8th saying it was ready to be picked up. I asked what the problem was and the guy said it was the throttle. I asked him if the car would be fine and safe to drive and he said it was fixed but they couldn't guarantee that I would not happen again.This is exactly what I had been reading about on line except it was happening on older models. Seriously! No way! I am not at all satisfied with that answer and after almost being killed in a rear end collision this is not ok with me. I refuse to drive the car and especially now that we have a two week old grand daughter and a grandson on the way there is no way in hell that I'm putting them in that lemon. I already called the Ford manufacturer and asked them how they are going to make this right. I was told I would be receiving a call from someone by Friday Aug. 19th. So I'll be waiting and if I don't hear back from them by the end of the day they'll be hearing from me.","1063":"I was with my 5 year old daughter on the interstate when the car died 3 times within 5 miles.

I was finally able to exit the highway and drive home on side streets.The car was towed and is on the way to the dealership. They have agreed to provide a loaner while they repair the vehicle. I'm sure they'll say it is the throttle body as most people have reported similar stories. If a semi truck would have been behind me, I would not be typing this complaint.

They were very accommodating and provided a rental for me. I was told that the Throttle Body was defective and was replaced. I hope this helps the next person that experiences the same problem.

Started to turn right, hit accelerator pedal and vehicle barely moved. Lost power, could only go 5 mph. Wrench light came on, as did AWD. Created traffic hazzard as vehicles backed up behind on city street. Creeped to a parking area and had vehicle towed to dealer for evaluation and repair. Cause was powertrain control module (PCM) which was not replaced (following current Ford policy), but reprogrammed, meaning this could happen again in an even more dangerous setting, such as proceeding through an intersection or on a highway.-Clarksville, MD, USA","1081":"Driving down the road and the vehicle suddenly went to idle. Had to coast to a stop on the side of the road. The car was still idling but when I tried to give it gas, nothing happened. I shut the car off, restarted and it worked fine. Approx. 10 miles later, did the same thing. Car only has 9,200 miles. I drive the interstate daily and this is going to be very dangerous if it happens there. Will be at the dealer at 9:00am sharp tomorrow.-Spring Hill, FL, USA","1082":"Purchased the 2016 Edge with 54 miles on it August 26, 2016. Drove it the following day to a family cookout approx. 40 miles one way, during which time the AWD temporarily disabled light came on. Called the dealership on Monday. Dropped the Edge off on Thursday evening due to schedules. Metal shavings were found in the transfer case. Service dept said a new transfer case would have to be installed. On Tuesday, September 6 told the transfer would be ordered, but would take 2 days to be delivered with an additional 5 hours to be installed. Called the service department on Thursday September 8th to obtain progress and when I might be able to pick it up on Friday, only to be told the transfer case is on back order until September 22nd.","1083":"My Ford Edge was purchased new in July 2016 (build date of 5\/16). In starting up the vehicle on Jan. 15 2017 with 6,302 miles on the odometer, the \"adaptive steering fault service required\" light came on (solid yellow warning). This stayed on for about 15 miles of a 22 mile trip, then went out. I parked the car at a valet service. When the car was returned to me later, I noticed the \"adaptive steering fault service required\" light was on again, and the steering wheel was now turned 90 degrees to the right in order to drive straight ahead (blocking my view of the instrument cluster). This situation continued for the entire 22 mile trip back home. During this time, the steering felt normal other than for the position of the steering wheel (which was awkward to say the least). The warning light went out the next morning and the steering wheel returned to it's properly aligned position! the warning light came back on the next morning, but so far the steering wheel has not changed from it's proper position.-Foster City, CA, USA","1084":"Difficulty steering vehicle when car is moving on city street.

On start up the car would register the error and make steering difficult with steering input not register to the turning of the wheels. The steering column also makes a grinding noise.

On October 25, 2016 we received a message indicating \u017cadaptive steering fault service required.\u017c later that same day, the message did not appear on the driver display. However, on October 26, 2016, we received the same message: \u017cadaptive steering fault service required.\u017c we went to a local Ford service department (in concord, ca) and they performed electrical testing for steering warning messages. Their test appeared to be inconclusive and they cleared all codes and road tested the vehicle and it appeared to pass inspection. However, just today, November 1, 2016, we received the same message again: \u017cadaptive steering fault service required.\u017c we immediately took the vehicle to a local Ford service department so they could see the error message and they did not have answers, even after pulling the codes. They will be communicating with the \"Ford\" hotline and in contact with \"those who manufactured the vehicle.\" From what we understand, after researching the issue online, that this may be a major safety issue and we are extremely concerned as steering ability may cease and the car may stop functioning. Other Ford Edge drivers are having this issue. This is of grave concern as it is our primary car that we use to Transport our children in daily. Our online research leads us to believe this is not an easy or well known fix as the adaptive steering in the 2016 Ford Edge is new technology. We intentionally purchased a new car to avoid any major issues for some time, so we are extremely frustrated and disappointed with our Ford purchase. The most important concern is the safety of our family while riding in this vehicle.-Martinez, CA, USA","1088":"At about 4500 miles, an \"adaptive steering fault - needs service\" light came on. It went off. Then, a day or two later it came on again. I took the Edge into norm reeves Ford in cerritos, ca to have them \"service\" the adaptive steering. They told me they could find no problem. A week or so later, I took it back to norm reeves Ford and they kept the vehicle for 13 days told me they couldn't \"replicate\" the problem. Now, a month later, the light stays on. I have read on the \"Ford Edge forum\" blog that others are having the same problem. Some are saying that their vehicles have been in the shop over a month and Ford seems unable to fix the problem. Others mentioned that the service department told them that the problem could be dangerous. I have contacted Ford's regional customer service manager for the California area. So far, Ford seems to be ignoring the problem.-Norwalk, CA, USA","1089":"Adaptive steering fault service required error.

The dashboard lit up with adaptive steering issue warning light telling me to take it in for service. I thought the car had died, but after a restart, it seemed to drive ok and I put it up to a one time computer glitch. I was 70 miles from home. I almost forgot it happened but after returning from a long trip, it happened again. I went to the forum and saw others had the same issue. And they mentioned that it sometimes effected the steering itself. Sure enough, the next day, the wheel turned 90 degrees to left. I was stopped at the time. The car was driveable but went straight with the wheel turned 90 degrees to the left. Very disconcerting, to say the least. The warning light was back on, of course. I had to get into twon so proceeded carefully. I filled the tank, and after the restart, the wheel straightened out and warning light went off. The wheel turning has not happened since, but the warning light comes on at least twice per day randomly. I am reporting this as a safety issue with the adaptive steering. I am scared to drive my new car.-Harwich, MA, USA","1091":"Adaptive steering fault - service required! while driving down the road, steering wheel changed ratio, became extremely light and disconnected from wheels. Steering wheel also changed to a 45 degree right angle while driving straight down the road. This is a safety issue! escalated to Ford, stating I lost confidence in driving this car.

Light came on, called my dealer who said to take to the nearest Ford Dealer which turned out to be Gurley in South Bend, Indiana. Service advisor, Mike Campbell was very courteous and helpful because we still had to drive to a 6:00 pm wedding in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend and get thru Chicago traffic. Car was put on computer and we were told that we would need a new steering wheel assembly. Of course that part will not be available until July. Told to decide our next step but vehicle should be driveable. Light went out but side warning screens no longer appeared. This delay caused us to hit Chicago at the worst time and we were stuck in traffic and missed the wedding (ridiculous after spending 2 nights on the road and expenses). I had the car serviced several days before leaving to prevent any problems. This is the 2nd major issue with this vehicle which stickered at $ 48,000+ - you should be able to expect more.

Nothing hit it, but dealer insists it was contacted by something that caused the crack. How anything hit the top of the closed sunroof while on a highway is beyond me. Ford will not cover it under any warranty because they say it was caused by a rock.","1099":"I bought my Ford Edge 2106 less than 6 months ago, it has about 5,000 Km. In March, Guess what?!!! the sunroof cracked all the way. This has nothing to do with the hot\/cold weather because it was way colder back in December and January. Ford better do a recall on this issue since it is related to safety before they get sued.","1100":"Noticed what I thought was water trapped in the glass. Took it into the local ford dealership and have been told the glass is broken.They are telling me something has hit it but there is no impact point and I'm sure if something hit the roof and caused it to crack that I would of noticed or if something had dropped onto the car that it would of been on the car when I returned. (As I'm assuming to break reinforced glass it would have to be something sizeable to cause it to crack)On the day I noticed it we had snow the night before and the car had a layer of snow on the roof.I was told here in the UK that they have not heard of any issues with the roof and are saying it will cost \u00a31,700 + to get fixed.I have added a photo. The crack is by the control buttons in the centre.","1101":"This seems to be a complaint that others have already filed. The panoramic vista roof glass developed a series of cracks after less than a month and 2,000 miles of driving. Clearly a manufacturer defect in the glass or the installation. I am waiting to hear back on whether or not the repair will be covered. I certainly hope that it will as there is a demonstrated flaw in this panel and it is clear that there was no impact to the glass in my vehicle. I will update this as soon as I have heard back from Ford...hopefully to confirm that it has been addressed without issue. Apart from this annoyance, the car has been terrific.","1102":"I was driving home christmas night after spending the weekend with family, it was raining hard and windy (20-30mph gusts). While driving with my wipers on at 70mph on interstate 35 South just North of albert lea Minnesota my wiper blades started to get caught in the wind, I heard a slapping noise a few times and then all the sudden as the wipers went to wipe the passenger side blade was lifted by the wind and was dropped on top of the other blade. The latch that holds the blade on to the driver side wiper was blocking the passenger side blade and caused the wipers to become non functional. At this point I was getting very nervous because visibility rapidly dimished because I could no longer use my wipers. I tried turning them on to high and low and they would not work. The wipers did try to \"fix\" them selves by pulsing a few times but only in the down direction, had they tried to go in the upright direction I think they could have fixed them selves. At this point I had no choice but to pull over in the cold and rain to manually move the wiper arms into a position were they could work normally, mind you I was going 70mph and was not able to see very well to even pull over. On an unrelated note, the headlights in this vehicle especially when the roads are wet are the absolute worse headlights I have ever used.

At that point I would have to wait 30 minutes or so until the latch would release. I took the car to the dealer and it looked like it was fixed. Unfortunately, the fix didn't last. Immediately when closing the door it would open again by itself, then lose power, requiring manual closing. Monday will be the 3rd visit to the service center. Every time without a loaner.

I was furious but didn't say anything ,I guess when your brand new car breaks down you should be overjoyed that Ford can take the time to make the effort to fix your car! no one from Ford Company headquarters actually worked to fix this problem aside from a few phone calls ,the mechanics are only as good as the team that backs them up! \nThis is day 22 still no car, and headquarters which we have always had to call, they are not good about returning phone calls ,informed us today they will not get us a rental so I can drive my daughter to Chicago to return to college, So we are basically on our own, NO BIG SURPRISE THERE WE HAVE BEEN ON OUR OWN 22 DAYS, 2 CAR PAYMENTS AND FULL COVER INSURANCE ON A PIECE OF SH-T CAR THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED IT CANNOT EVEN REPAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nToday Sarah\/ Sally told my husband we do not qualify for a replacement, she said we have consumer options.

This was on a brand new vehicle that I went to pick-up from dealership. I also checked four other new Edges on the dealer lot and they all had the same problem. Dealership said it was because there wasn't enough carpet there? We didn't accept the vehicle and they said they would fix the problem. We'll see what their fix will be??? \nBIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THAT FORD HAS DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THIS CONTINUED QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEM AND POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE! \nTruly unbelievable and unacceptable for a $45,000 Titanium Edition Edge.Dennis M. Loftis\nConway, SC, USAPrior Complaint Reported:\nThe driver side carpet above the dead-pedal right by the OBDII sensor has no place to clip. The dealer replaced this carpet once under warranty but the piece of carpet did not appear any different. The issue is the edge by the dead-pedal cannot attach to any place and falls down on the driver's foot. If the driver uses his or her foot for driving (applying the brake) this could be an extremely dangerous situation which could catch the driver's foot and render the driver helpless. Ford needs to fix this issue by permanently attaching the top of the carpet to the vehicle.\nUpdate from Jan 22, 2016: The car finally got back from the dealership and this is what they told us:\nThere is no fix for the sagging carpet. We have checked other Ford Edge vehicles for sale and all of them had the exact same problem. There is no place to secure the carpet except to make a hole and tie a zip tie up past the electrical.\nThat does not sound like a very good idea to be as the wires could eventually rub through the wires causing a fire. Therefore there does not really seem to be a good solution at this point.\n- Aaron S., Savannah, GA, USA","1112":"Vehicle has 4,800 miles. While driving vehicle lost engine power and power steering.

It was also very dangerous because the car broke down in detroit. I was able to get to the shoulder, and restart the vehicle to try to get off the highway. While trying to get to a better location, the car lost power two more times, while in street traffic. Again, very dangerous. Since this is a brand new Ford Edge (2016), with under 10,000 miles, it was taken to the dealer, who found a defective throttle body assembly. They replaced the throttle body assembly, and because there is still no recall on that part, it could very well have been replaced with another defective part, leaving me at risk again for injury, or worse.

Car is in now for repairs, so who knows how long it will take to get new carpet replaced along with windsheild and whst ever needs to be fixed.So how long has this car been sitting on the lot leaking, causing rust and who knows if water has got on any electronics. Ford Canada will not let me return the car but I will not let up until I receive an extended warranty on electronic components where the water leaked, I shouldn't be held responsible for future electric problems that may occur from sloppy manufacturing. FORD is to busy jamming there vehicles with all this technology, that they have let here reliability and quality slip big time.","1131":"Had the car a couple of days and finally got it on the turnpike and noticed the horrible wind noise it was coming from the drivers door and the back doors. The first time they said they would adjust the doors and it would fix it. I didn't even get it on the highway and it was back. Took it right back and they said again they fixed it. Nope try again. 3rd time, I had the manager come with me. He heard it and said they would fix it, and he said they did, but it was not fixed. The shop guy said there is nothing they can do for it. So I will continue to call every day, take it in every week if I have to, until something is done. I hate wind noise. It is horrible. The faster you go, the worst it gets.","1132":"Each time I go in for an oil change, I tell them about the excess wind noise, most noticeable on driver side, when traveling over 40 mph they say I need to go on a test drive with one of the service technicians and then leave the car. The dealership, Dean Sellers Ford in Troy, MI is not open on Saturdays and I work out of town. Last time I spoke with someone at the dealership, they told me to find another Ford dealer closer to where I work out of town so I can leave the car with them. I don't have a problem with leaving my car at a dealership but still need a car to travel for work while the car is being repaired.Update from Mar 6, 2017:I have had the car in on three different times (multi-days each time) to try to correct problem.  The first couple of times involved re-adjusting the driver side door alignment and then replacing the driver door weather stripping, both without success.  During a winter ice storm, in which ice was covering driver side edge of windshield and A-pillar, the noise went away.  After ice fully melted and had a chance to inspect further, I found a small gap (~12-15\" long) between the A-pillar and the vertical aluminum trim piece (driver side of windshield) in which the adhesive was missing or improperly installed.  We believe that is the source of the unusual wind noises.  The dealer, Fox Ford in Cadillac, MI (they have been very helpful in trying to resolve, even though I did not buy the car from them) is now recommending that the entire windshield be replaced.  Aluminum trim and windshield parts have been ordered, but are back-logged for a couple of weeks.","1133":"wind noise on driver's side when going over 50 mphWill be making an appointment with the dealer asap.

I called roadside assistance immediately and the technician told me to turn off the traction control. There was a pungent smell all inside the car of gas and other fumes, but I did not see any fluids leaking from under the vehicle. The technician told me to start the car with the traction control off. I rolled down all of the windows to lessen the odor. The car started as usual and I started back down the highway. Within 3 miles the car stopped again, the same warning lights began flashing. I had lost several gallons of fuel in 3 miles. I got the car to a parking lot off the interstate and it died and would not turn back over. When I tried to get it to start, the ignition got stuck and would not stop trying to turn over. The car was losing fuel and would not run at all. The dealership said it was a fuel pump issue and they replaced the part several days later.

Then the car stopped again and the warnings began again.In 3 miles I lost 7 gallons of gas and the car stopped and never turned back on. I had to have the car towed to a dealership in Knoxville that was closed. I was 400 miles from home with my son and stranded. The dealership wouldn't be open until Monday morning and I had to somehow get home. I was forced to get a rental car to drive home the next day.The dealership called and said it was the full pump and that it would be 7-10 days before the car could be repaired. Of course they would only cover 5 days car rental. They explained it was going to take that long because the part was backordered nationwide. None of this was my fault, but I was going to have to pay for a rental car and then drive back to Knoxville to pick it up. I had to take a day off work and drive 12 hours to go get my car once it was \"fixed\". Now, how the full pump made the stability track and traction control signals flash, no one explained to me. I did learn that the odor was fuel leaking and that when I followed the roadside assistant's advice and restarted the car, the car could have caught fire and seriously injured all of us inside. Since picking the car up, my gas mileage has been incorrect and flutes while the car is turned off. One day, I lost 20 miles while I ate lunch. I have video of the rpm's fluctuating in idol and as you accelerate. The car hasn't operated the same since the repair. The worst part is the car just did THE EXACT SAME THING as I drove to work this morning! I was stranded in the middle of a busy intersection!

I have video evidence of all of the issues with this car. I started taking video when I returned home from picking the car up and noticed I kept losing gas and the backup camera kept switching on. This car is an accident waiting to happen. It isn't safe and I definitely don't feel safe carrying my children in it or allowing my eldest son to drive it.

The speed continued decreasing when we noticed that the radio had also shut down. Fortunately we were able to make our way to the breakdown lane without any mishap. That's when we notice the engine was also completely shut down. We were fortunate that we were able to pull over without causing an accident. We called the dealership and explained the problem and was puzzled that they were not too concerned about the problem. My wife is not concerned about the safety of this vehicle. I have noticed that complaints have been reporting a similar problem. My vehicle is currently at the dealership and they provided me with a loaner in the meantime. I was told that most likely they will not be able to find any problem with the vehicle. This is not much consolation, to us when we will be returning to Florida in the near future and wonder whether this problem will occur again when we are on expressways with five to six lanes, all going 70 mph or more and with little room to get out of the way to safety. Looking at other similar issues, what is mentioned as the problem could be the switch, the battery or the alternator, or wiring to all these components. I cannot believe that this issue cannot be diagnosed and remedied immediately before someone gets hurt.-Sarasota, FL, USA","1179":"My wife and I were driving our 2015 Chevrolet Traverse on the interstate traveling at 80mph. When I took my foot off the accelerator the accelerator stayed in the down position and continued to accelerate the vehicle. We were up to 90 mph. I put my feet on the brakes and was able to slow the vehicle to 70mph. The accelerator was still stuck in the floored position and fighting the brakes. I was able to manipulate my foot behind the accelerator and after several attempts to pull the accelerator up it released. There was a loud clunk and we were able to pull the car off the interstate. When the car was placed in park, all the warning lights went on and the engine shut off. The vehicle would no longer start. Chevrolet towed the vehicle to the dealership where it was discovered the accelerator sensor and module went 'bad' per the dealer. The sensor malfunction caused the accelerator to stick per the dealership.-Mount Pleasant, SC, USA","1180":"Drove my brand new 2015 Chevy Traverse to work for 2.1 miles, parked, within 15 mins my car caught on fire.

I lost power and stopped in an unlit, busy intersection. I thought I was going to die. Fortunately no cars hit me. I rolled into a small ditch and stopped. If I stepped on the gas, nothing really happened. I shut car off and looked in owners manual where it said to start car up again. I did and then it worked. I drove to car dealer next day and they knew exactly what was going on as I got out of my car they said they would give me a loaner, which I am currently driving. Mthe said it was a transmission sensor or switch that they had to replace. Obviously, gmmknows about this. This could hve been a fatal accident, easily. This is a crime in that my dealer sold me this car without disclosing a known problem to me. These cars are not safe and I will try to trade it in asap for something less hazardous. Again, this is a criminal act that GM is doing by continuing to sell these cars. If no one has died yet, they will soon.

It only has 8000 miles on it. I dropped my son at school and pulled out to drive to work, when the vehicle suddenly started to feel like it wasn't going forward and started shaking side to side. There was a terrible smell like gas at first then another odor. Smoke started coming out of the back so I pulled over and shut the vehicle off. I had to have it towed to the dealer so I am at work (late) and awaiting the news. My gripe is how a relatively new car that has low milege and is clearly maintained can have an issue like this. Thank god I was not far from home or on a major highway with my children. The whole reason I lease a vehicle is because I believed a new vehicle would be safe for myself and my children.Update from Dec 14, 2016:It is now 5-1\/2 hours later.  Englewood Chevrolet where I leased the vehicle is  telling me it is possibly bad gas.  I have gone to the same gas station in my town for 25 years, so does my husband for his work vehicles (3 vans).

Thanks for that!). I had belongings in the car too which were listed to GM's rep, not much, typical stuff you leave in your car.Nobody is doing a thing to help.

The defective airbags causes safety concerns and diminishes the resale value of this vehicle, the defective airbags in the Traverse may cause unsafe driving conditions and financial burden to us as owners.

In fact I always bragged about their service department being #1 but, with the most recent purchase my husband & I made with salesman Funk we are very disappointed with having to return with our brand new vehicle(2016 Chevrolet Traverse) 2 days after purchasing it to have to already have service on for condensation in tail light on drivers side as well as speaker in rear on same side not working! So now we have to do without the use of our brand new car & the free onstar services from Friday til Tuesday evening. The rental they put us in has none of these services. Mr. Funk calls & tells us our vehicle is ready on Tuesday but we get there & when we get ready to get in our car I notice the panel they removed in the rear to fix speaker which they said was never connected at the factory is laying in the back seat. Now we have to wait for Mr. Funk to take vehicle back to service to have them put it on saying I'm sorry I should have checked it before I called you! Then one day after picking up our car we find that condensation is not only in tail light on drivers side again but in tail light on passenger side as well. We call & now ask to speak to the new car sales manager but call went directly to a recording on which we left a message. After not getting a response we then called Chevrolet Headquarters on March 23rd & made a complaint & received a complaint number & also spoke with an officer by the name of Jame's told him of our concerns which he assured us that someone from Maxton (ROBERT OR JEFFERY)would be contacting us within 24 to 48 hour's I told him I hope so cause we had plans to be in N.Y. for Easter for a month. Unfortunately no one contacted us so we missed being in NY for Easter! On this past Monday James called us & asked had anyone contacted us when we said no to which he seemed to be shocked & then stated he was going to call them & get right back to us. It's now Wednesday we haven't heard from James(Headquarter) nor Robert or Jeffery of(Jack Maxton) our holiday was ruined to say the least!! We feel like instead of them causing us an inconvenience of driving 30 miles there & back(gas & time) for a vehicle which is brand new they should just replace it with one that does not have these issues. Of course the condensation does not stay so by the time we can get car to dealer is gone!! But we made pictures & video. This was to be a second vehicle for us we were planning on also purchasing a Chevy Suburban but after this we are done with Chevrolet & will change to Lincoln or another type vehicle for our next purchase! FORWARD TO HJNICHOLSON@CRIMSON.UA.E\u2026 Read lessWell it now seem's as though we'll miss our God daughter's christianing on 4\/10\/16 in New York because it seem's as though Jame's (who was to get back to me on Monday 3\/27\/16 number 866-790-5700 EXT: 591-3683 )has now disappeared!! It is now 4\/1\/16 Friday & we've not heard from him nor Jeffery or Robert!! Don't want to leave for extended vacation in a brand new car with issue's. This is really inconvenience for us. You know they always say bring the vehicle in when you have the problem again but it happened after they were closed the condensation will be gone a day later but we do have video & photo's of problem. If they treat a customers such as us who has had a relationship for over 15 years with them how do you expect them to treat new customers!! Wish we'd read some of these reviews prior to purchasing our new vehicle Anyone with some good legal advice!!!Update from Apr 14, 2016:Chevrolett replaced both lights we did not receive a work order but did receive a 6 page document IDL4375388 when our vehicle was returned explaining how replacing the lights still may not solve the issue & how it is normal to have condensation due to air inside the lamp assembly, through atmospheric changes reaching dew point.  This should have been pointed out prior to us purchasing this vehicle not after so even though they gave us a $50.00 gas card we are still very unhappy knowing this may not solve the issue on a brand new car.

I purchased the vehicle based on the mpg printed on the window sticker. Now I am told you will not get that mpg. I am now be cheated out of 44 miles per tank of gas.

Both the dealership and Chevrolet keep giving me the run around on the issue. If I had known the actual gas mileage was 22 mph on the highway I would have never bought this vehicle.

I had her turn off the car and restart it. Continually, (throughout the day yesterday), as we traveled around, doing christmas shopping, this warning reappeared each time we stopped, got out to shop and return to start the Traverse.. when I returned home, I google the meaning of this warning, what was it causes, what it entailed \/ how to remedy this warning and my startled and dismayed as the search results popped up.... Chevrolet was aware of the design defect in the Traverse vehicles, but did not warn us or other consumers prior to purchasing. The defective airbags causes safety concerns and diminishes the resale value of this vehicle, the defective airbags in the Traverse may cause unsafe driving conditions and financial burden to us as owners. As noted ignoring the active service air bag warning light will eventually result in the non-deployment of the side impact restraints, which include driver and passenger seat-mounted side air bags, front center air bag (if equipped), and the seat belt pre-tensioners. Seems this issue has been a recurring model issue since 2010..

I experienced the problem when I was backing out of a parking area off a dirt road. I'd been waiting for the car behind me to back out so that I could back out. I turned on the ignition, had my foot on the brake, put it into reverse and next thing I knew I was hurtling backwards. It felt like being sucked backward and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I smashed into the car behind me and it was terrifying both for me and, I'm sure, for the guy behind me who suddenly had this SUV crashing into the front of his car. He thought his car was totaled. The insurance companies are handling it, but I told both my insurance company and Enterprise that I thought the Traverse had surged. I did eventually drive the vehicle back home (avoiding reverse completely), and noticed when the car was in cruise control mode that same surge-feeling in drive when going up a hill--like it was going way too fast. Later, I saw online a complaint of a similar thing (reverse surge) happening with a 2009 Traverse. I don't think this car should be on the road, and the people handling the claim for Enterprise say that it's not (which is good), but they just warned me that if their inspection doesn't show a problem with the vehicle, I could be liable for expenses since it has been pulled from their fleet.","1221":"12\/21\/16 first, I pulled out of driveway and the vehicle would only go about 1-2 miles an hour for several blocks...pulled over and put in park and revved the engine a little and pulled out again. It still wouldn't accelerate at first, then gradually picked up speed and rode the remainder without incident. On 12\/22\/16, one second I was parking my car in front of the store I work at, and was almost completely stopped with my foot on the brake, when all of a sudden the car lunged forward into the brick wall of the building. The airbag in the steering column deployed. The car bounced back and shut down I think). I reached up and turned the key off & L opened the door & the radiator was leaking onto the lot.. my knees were hurting really bad, both my hands were sore and my left arm. The car front was all damaged with part of the fender on the sidewalk. We called my husband to come and take me to get checked out because I thought I might have cracked both my kneecaps. We contacted our insurance company and they told us to have the car towed to our preferred body shop, which we did. The dr X-rayed my knees and determined they were not broken, just badly bruised. On Dec 26th, I went back to the dr because I started having some pain in my neck\/shoulder and they did numerous tests, finding what they thought was a fracture in my neck. I had to wear a brace on it for a week, then more testing determined that what they saw was actually a previous injury that had never been caught. I need physical therapy on the neck issue. I have since found that there are several complaints of these cars suddenly lurching forward when the brake is applied, over a span of 7 years. I am not only thankful I wasn't injured worse, but that there wasn't a person in front of me when this happened. I am very concerned that it could happen again and the outcome could be much worse.-Grand Island, NE, USA","1222":"Passenger side window exploded. We were driving on an open rural highway with no vehicles near us in the afternoon. The weather was about 75 degrees and sunny. All windows were up and the A\/C was on.

I did find on the internet that another Traverse owner had their windshield pulled then reseated and that stopped the problem. Another owner stated they had a strip of insulation put into a gap, and it worked for a little while, then started up again. It's a shame to drive such a nice and comfortable vehicle and have to listen to that awful noise. Chevrolet needs to find a permanent fix to this problem that seems to have happened over several model year.","1224":"outside air noise at 60 mph and above very annoying.

XM radio stations drop in and out where you cannot listen to XM at all. FM and AM part of the radio work fine. With much troubleshooting online and discussing with XM folks, problem was narrowed down to the XM receiver in the vehicle. GM Dealership replaced this unit, but it did not fix the signal loss. We are now at a loss of what to do. I have 5 other XM accounts, two of which are in Corpus Christi and all radios work fine without signal loss. I have even placed my portable XM in the car and it works fine. I guess sell the car and sell the problem. Any solutions to this would be appreciated. It is however, a very nice vehicle with no other issues to mention.\nWhat we have done:\nContacted XM and no reports of issues like this in town\nRefreshed the signal several times\nReplaced the XM receiver in vehicle which provided a new radio ID number\nRemoved any electronic devices in vehicle such as Cell phone, that could intefereThe only part not replaced would be the antenna.

After only a couple weeks of ownership we dropped off our new vehicle to be repaired.  Dealer 's GMC certified technician had to consult with GMC corporate to help troubleshoot and then decided to replace the lower and upper valve covers which was a quick fix that lasted a little over a week.  Now our brand new vehicle is once again a lemon and repeating the original issue.After contacting GMC and after requesting another new vehicle since its common sense that a brand new truck should not have any internal engine problems; GMC corporate response was \"don't you think that 1 car in 300,000 would have an issue\"...  that's a sad response since I would imagine that replacing 1 out of 300,000 would not even phase their bottom line - at the end we are not talking about a loose belt or wheel out of balance, but an internal problem which there tech told my wife that he could not guarantee that the care was safe during his test drive.The dealer's manager response was \"the car is not our problem when it leaves our lot\", it then falls under the manufacture warranty; which makes sense, but once again we are talking about a brand new car, not a car that has some usage. Shame on me for allowing my family to purchase an American car from a company that has to heavily discount there vehicle to show value, and compete for market share, and also, a company to worried about their bottom line.  It has now become obvious to me on why they failed and went bankrupt.","1267":"Well I first had a problem with my car under warranty and Bob Moore in Oklahoma City replaced my throttle body, and my power steering pump. Then at about 36,000 miles I went back again for my rpm gauge revving up and done in idle and same thing happened I took it back they worked on the same part, but said the problems was fixed. Then I take it back again because the same day I received my vehicle back it was worse, I thought I had put bad gas in it because it was idling so hard, and then it started shutting off. I called and ranted about my car being a lemon piece of crap and then they were so helpful that they took my car in to check the problem, which they still gave me a rental( since I drive 4 hours each way) to take home. I go to pick my fixed car supposedly and I get a block down the road, and put gas in my car and it shutters so hard my car almost cut off in traffic. I'm so pissed by this time that I just wanna trade this piece of crap, but they think they can find the problem. Well I just received my car back, and drove to Dallas which is about two hours and my car stats rpm jumping again. I am a mother of two kids and I need a dependable care. Do not buy this car, this is the worst investment I have ever made in a vehicle. I looked at this car because it had really good ratings on all the research sites, well i wouldn't use any of those sites again, my husband and I will be ok cause we can afford to trade this piece ofsh*tcar off and pay of our stupid mistake. Many parents and single parents cannot. This is a family vehicle, and this has cost my family a lot of time, and inconvenience to get it fixed. Again I can't say enough, stay away from this car.","1268":"When the vibration happened when I left my house.

I took it back to the dealership on 8\/25 and requested a service manager to drive with me, he felt and heard the noise. Advised me to leave my car so they could run more tests because he had never heard nor felt this vibration in the gas pedal and gear shift. They have me a 2015 Buick Enclave loaner..guess what..LOL...that car made the same exact noise\/vibration. My car was in the shop for 4 days.The service manager said that they contacted GMC and there are no active recalls for the issue, no other drivers nor dealers have reported this issue. Due to lack of issues being filed for the problem there is no fix to an 'no existent issue', so I had to come and pick up my car.I AM FURIOUS! This car is less than a month old, I haven't even made my first payment and this car is giving me issues that the manufacture and service department can not even fix. I called GM directly before going to the dealership to pick up my car and they opened a file number and said they were going to check on it and call me back. I of course had to call and call them back because they show no lack of concern for their cars with a defect and are not willing to fix it. To this very moment, I am still having an issue!

I limped it home, but it was over heating bad enough you could smell it. I had it towed to Auto Nation in Laurel MD. They discovered a crack in the transmission housing. They said it was likely a defect when it was made and never caught, which means it was also likely slowly leaking transmission fluid since before I bought it. They did a rebuild, replacing most of the transmission.After exactly three weeks I got my car back. That was this past Friday, February 5th. I took it back into them this morning, which is February 9th. I noticed friday on the way home it was shifting hard, often jerking hard enough to jerk me in my seat. It was also shaking in the 3rd gear and often revving into the 4,000 and 5,000rpm range before shifting.

Traffic ahead starts moving again, but since vehicle won't move on its own driver is required to press accelerator to get it moving again or acc to resume its operation (this is by design). In such scenario if driver ends up pushing accelerator a bit harder(I.e. more than just tapping it), acc applies very strong brakes stopping vehicle right there. By this time vehicle behind you has started moving already and might rear-end due to abrupt stop. I guess acc thinks distance between you and vehicle ahead is very less and thinks its going to collide and hence applies strong brakes. But this is a bad design\/programming since it expects driver to push acc. Pedal for acc to resume operations, but if driver does it bit more than what acc likes, there is a chance of accident.

My last option at this point, he stated that the vehicle is repairable and cannot cancel the sale.I am now stuck with a brand new vehicle with 77 miles, which has had major mechanical work done to it! Worst car buying experience of my life as well, I truly hope this compliant hits the desk of the major General Motors person in charge of consumer complaints. I am very upset, as I do feel this issue was per-exsisiting before purchase of vehicle. I would greatly appreciate great attention into this matter.Thank You","1303":"I picked up my 2017 GMC Acadia on February 28, 2017. This vehicle was a dealer trade because our local dealer didn't have one with the equipment I wanted and in the color I wanted. I test drove an Acadia Denali that the dealer had and was pleased. My salesperson drove to a neighboring state to drive back the Acadia I now have. I live about 20 miles from the dealership. The night I drove it home involved city stop and go driving then about a 12 mile stretch of 4 lane highway before arriving in the small town I live in. Just before I got on the highway I felt a slight vibration in the steering wheel and assumed it was rough road. Once on the highway I felt the vibration again and it felt like I ran over the rumble strips that are on the side of the road and along the center stripe. The vibration faded away. I approached a slow moving car and had to slow down before changing lanes to pass. As I passed the car and got up to 60\/61 mph I felt the vibration again. Once again it slowly faded away. This happened 3 more times in that short stretch of highway. This is an AWD equipped Acadia and I was driving it in 2 wheel drive. Now I'm concerned. I told my husband about it when I got home and he said he would drive it the next day to check it out. A couple of days went by and he finally drove it the following Friday and he felt the same thing. He agreed that something isn't right and that we should take it back to the dealer. That day I started googling the situation and have come across many other 2017 Acadia owners with the same problem. The disturbing part is that no one can diagnose the problem, and from what I'm seeing, GM claims it's normal. This is NOT normal! I still have not registered my Acadia because I am finishing out a lease on a Buick Lacrosse that's been a dream car. The Acadia is sitting in my garage, and frankly, I'm hesitant to drive it or register it. It really makes me sick to look at that beautiful vehicle and not know whether the problem can be fixed or not. I called our dealer on Friday and made an appointment to have them take a look at the truck next week. I'm trying to stay calm and give the dealer a chance to diagnose and fix the problem. I thought I did my homework before leasing the Acadia, but I obviously didn't do enough research.Update from Mar 16, 2017:March 16, 2017.  The Acadia has been at my dealer since March 7.  They have replaced the rear transmission mount and the vibration is still there.  They plan to replace the front transmission mount and I fully expect the vibration will still be there.Update from Mar 27, 2017:March 27, 2017.  Upgrading the front and rear transmission mounts has not eliminated the vibration in my Acadia.  My dealer has given all info to GM Technical and they said they are going to send a field engineer to inspect and drive my truck.  I am hoping that the field engineer can figure this out.Update from Jun 2, 2017:My issue has finally been resolved!  I received an email from another Acadia owner with the same problem giving me the number of a service bulletin that fixed the vibration.  The service bulletin is 17-na-168.  It recallibrates the ECM (computer)  I took my truck to my dealer yesterday and an hour later the vibration is gone!  So very happy to report this, and I hope this helps others with the vibration issue.","1304":"This vehicle was a order out of a new model so there was no opportunity to test drive this unit prior to purchase. That said I would counsel anyone one considering the new body style 2017 Acadia with the new 3.6L V6 engine, to do a complete evaluation of the car you are considering for this problem.Here is the issue,.. there is a very audible drumming and vibration felt in the steering wheel and seats when the engine is in the V4 mode in two wheel (FWD) mode when the engine RPM's are between 1500 and 1750. This engine speed unfortunately corresponds to a highway speed of 56 to 63 miles an hour (MPH) and an in town speed of 28-40 MPH depending on the gear (which is precisely where most of my driving occurs). To add insult to the situation we had an occasion in the last few day to require the AWD to be engaged at interstate speed of 70-75 MPH (now with the engine in the V6 mode) and the drumming and vibration was constant, very concerning, annoying and unpleasant and did not cease until the vehicle was stopped and switched to the FWD mode.I have had the vehicle to the GM dealer who is extremely helpful and they confirm the problem, I also drove an identical model on the lot and it has the same issue. GM technical line was consulted and denied knowledge of the issue, suggested re-settling the driveline by loosening running the mounting points, then retighten to specs the motor and transmission mounts along with the exhaust system. This was done and resulted in no improvement, GM was informed and reported back that this was a \"normal operating characteristic\".I again would advise anyone to completely evaluate any 2017 Acadia (new model) with the 3.6L V6 engine for this issue before purchase. In fact with so many other great crossover vehicles available in this class look elsewhere.. consider yourself cautioned.Update from Nov 28, 2016:Now with over 2700 miles on the vehicle I am certain the vibration and drumming occurs at all times.  It just seems to presents itself unacceptably at the times indicated in my initial note. What that means as far as a cause and solution,.. I am not sure but back to the dealer once again this Friday. I will update on the results of that visit.","1305":"There is a very unnerving vibration which occurs at all speeds while trying to maintain constant speed. It is similar to when you have a window open while driving a n SUV , that baffling sound, but this happens whiles windows are closed. I had the car at the dealers for 10 days and they confirmed the problem on my car and the other 2017 Acadia's on the lot. They had no fix and now I have a $52,000.00 vehicle I can stand to be in!! They worked with GM tech and tried many things and came up with Zero! I think a lemon law or buy back should be started now before any more of these car are put out.","1306":"Hearing rattle sound from 2nd and 3rd row from day1 for 2017 GMC Acadia denali. Primary source seems(something inside) seats in 2nd row and may be 3rd row. Rattle can be heard when going over bumps or bad road patches on usual city roads. Seems whenever vehicle goes over a bad road patch, 2nd\/3rd row seats vibrate a lot and rattle sound can be heard. Sometimes I can hear slight rattle from around passenger side 1st row door as well.-Santa Clara, CA, USA","1307":"The drivers side front seat has something loose under the leather. There is something that moves when you go around turns or stops. It also makes noises and pops.-Cheswick, PA, USA","1308":"The contact owns a 2017 GMC Acadia. The contact stated that the horn did not function unless an abnormal force was exerted. The vehicle was taken to two dealers where it was confirmed that it took an excessive amount of force to get the horn to work. There was no remedy for the repair. The manufacturer was not notified. The VIN was unknown. The failure mileage was approximately 1,800.-Lake Orion, MI, USA","1309":"The contact owns a 2017 GMC Acadia.

The failure mileage was 700.-Elmhurst, IL, USA","1310":"I test drove 2017 Acadia Denali and found it very nice to drive, nice acceleration, smooth drive, smooth shifts etc. Inspected almost all features before buying. Ensured there is minimal road and other noises during Test drive.Bought it and while I was driving home, already could clearly hear some rattle from the 2nd\/3rd row seat area.\nDamn! this brand new 50K+ car and I started wondering am I really hearing this sound! \nRattle is noticeable when you are going on a bit bad(note road doesn't have to be very bad or you don't have to go off-road) city roads and at usual city drive speeds. Sound is less noticeable on Freeways at those speeds.\nMost of the Rattle seemed to be coming from 2nd row Driver-side seat. And from observations it seems rattle comes when the 2nd row seats vibrates for whatever reason. Some rattle was also probably coming from 3rd row seats when they vibrated.Took it to the dealer and had one of their mechanic come for a test drive. On one of the bad patch, he could instantly hear it and acknowledged the issue. Kept it at servicing center for 2 days. They said the 2nd row seats were making most of the rattle and it was due to lose seat release cables. They secured the loose cables and returned the vehicle. Said they need to order 2nd row seat hand rest\/cup holder since that was the one making most sound.Currently waiting for them to get the ordered component and get it replaced. But at this point I can still hear some rattle from 2nd row and now more from passenger side seat. To be honest many a times it seems the rattle is coming from lot of different places like : inside of multiple seats, inside of doors.For car this expensive I would have expected GMC to give me a very luxurious throughly Quality tested vehicle. Hearing rattle from Day1 is a big question mark on Quality Control Department of GMC. Rattle so obvious should have never made it to production. What I am most worried about is, since this is a all-new platform for 2017 year model, hopefully there is no fundamental issue with frame\/body integrity which is just getting manifested as rattle at this point. From reading at-least one article(http:\/\/www.therecord.com\/news-story\/6812014-super-glue-helps-automakers-improve-fuel-efficiency\/) it seems they are using super glue to hold different parts instead of usual rivets\/welds.","1311":"WOW - got rid of my 2014 traverse lease, n leased a 2017 arcadia- with navigation\/etc, this radio SUCKS.. stations I listened to in my traverse 75miles from my home, become all static at 35\/40 miles...n under a clear sky,no obtructions overhead, Sirius goes out offen... piss-poor radio I have for the next 3yrs unless there is a fix..","1312":"On my brand new 2017 GMC Acadia Denali the two air vents : one from 2nd row and one from 3rd row were improperly fitted.

Will be taking it to dealer soon and see how they can get it fixed. Probably its easy for them to fix, but annoying part is issue so easily detectable made it out to the customer and that too for Highest Denali Trim which is so costly!!","1313":"Owners manual says shade opens when slide or tilt function activated.

Six people have tried to push to make horn go and none could do it.Took to dealer and was told it was a poor design. If you take too hands and push on the horn it does make a noise.......they said there was nothing they could do. I contacted GMC---they said they can not do anything about a poor design feature. We were very upset as it is a safety issue and apparently people have to die before it becomes an issue. Two other vehicles of the same type were told they had the same problem.We do not want this to be like the air bag problem......only have deaths have been recorded. We do not feel safe driving a car that does not have a normal functioning horn. You should not have to take you hands off the wheel to attempt to blow the horn in a rush!!!! This is a serious issue that needs to be reviewed. To say it is simply a poor design does not protect my family.","1316":"The contact owns a 2015 Ford Flex.

It shattered into hundreds of pieces. It almost felt like someone threw a rock to the side window and left a whole right in the middle. There were no cars in front or back of the SUV, and there was no one around in such area and on top of the mountain. It has to be a manufacturing problem and that is why I would never buy an american car.","1318":"I was driving in the highway going about 65 mph when without warning I started loosing speed and ended going 20mph. I was able to pull of to the shoulder and notice a wrench icon appear in the dash before the car lost power. It was an extremely scary situation and I was thankful I was able to get to the shoulder of the highway without any incident. I towed it to my Ford dealer which is still there being diagnose. I don't know what happen but I believe its a defection because nothing was done to cause it. These is a very dangerous defection and can cause the life of the driver and passangers. I want to make the Ford company aware of this situation and demand it takes action before a tragedy happens. I hope my Ford Flex is fixed but I will never feel fully safe in this vehicle again.

Car ran ok from the post office until I got within sight of my driveway and lost power again. I pulled in the driveway and immediately called Ford Roadside Assistance to come pick the car up. I left the engine running as the service writer at the dealership had recommended the previous day. It took the wrecker driver 2 hours to get from Monroe, NC to Midland, NC approximately 30 miles. Then the wrecker driver said he could not tow the car with the engine running (against DOT rules and regulations) so the code was lost when the car ignition switch was turned off. When I got to the dealership with the wrecker driver, the service writer said he had good news that Ford had authorized replacement of the throttle body but the part was backordered until the 15th of July. I told the dealership to keep the car until it was properly repaired. The dealership did not have a loaner or offer to provide me with a rental but they did have someone give me a ride back home. I sat at home over the July 4th holiday with no transportation. Thanks Ford Motor Company!

After that, I still noticed the light would intermittently be on while there was a passenger in the seat. Specifically, myself or my daughter. Both of us are 110-120 lb adults. I again returned the car to Nissan who admitted that there is no definite weight that will activate the airbag and the 110-120 range is indeterminate. The suggestion was that I pull over and restart the car to reset the system to recognize a passenger in the seat. I am unable to establish any pattern of what causes it to happen. It seems very random. Occasionally when at a stop light, the car will recalculate and activate the airbag. I would estimate 40% of the time a passenger is in the seat, the light illuminates to indicate the airbag is off. I feel this is a faulty and dangerous design. No one disclosed when I bought the car I may not have airbag protection. Initially I was told the weight setting was anything greater than 70lbs would activate the airbag which is reasonable to protect smaller infant passengers that shouldn't be in the front seat to begin with.

My gas gauge and trip monitor indicated I had about 60 miles until empty then after driving a few miles it said about 30 miles to empty and shortly after that car started sputtering and losing power and I had to make emergency moves to keep from getting hit. Both times I was able to pull unto the shoulder and drive a short distance to a gas station to fill the tank which took only slightly over 15 gallons and the tank holds 19 gallons. I have found the identical complaint on several web sites and there does not seem to be any help from Nissan or even an admittance that the problem exits. I just returned from my dealer in naples, fl. And all they could tell me was that no error codes were showing and I could not expect the gauge to be accurate at all times since it is constantly recalculating and changing distance to empty. That really has nothing to do with the problem since the car was apparently not out of gas and in the past I have put over 18 gallons in the tank so I am certain it was not out of gas. I believe there must be a problem with the pickup tube, sensors or a combination of both. Having your vehicle suddenly stall in front of a semi truck is no laughing matter and we were lucky to have escaped without a major accident.

I was about a mile and a half from an exit and was able to drive on the shoulder and get to a station and refill the car. I topped it off at 16 gallons (car holds 19). The car ran fine after it was full. This was a dangerous situation given that traffic was moving at 70 miles per hour when the car dropped to 20 miles per hour. I called Nissan usa and my dealer and was told they couldn\u017cT do anything unless an engine light came on or they could replicate the problem. In March 2016, the car fuel light again came on while on a residential road. While the car registered 35 miles left until empty, the car again became sluggish and would not exceed 20 mph. I drove to a gas station and topped it off at 15.5 gallons. This time, like the last, the car worked normally when it was full. In April 2016, the dealer agreed to replace the two fuel level sensors. Since then I have not had the issue but also have filled up before or immediately after the fuel light comes on. Each time I have only been able to get slightly over 15 gallons in the tank.

Each time it happened was when I was merging from an on ramp into traffic. The last occurance, and I believe the others as well, I was going approx 35mph, staying steady on the speed looking for a spot in traffic to merge into, giving it gas and started my merge only to feel and hear no change in RPM or speed, giving it more and more petal, and still no change in speed at all, after avoiding the other driver that almost hit me because of it, I moved back over and had a moment and tried again to get into the petal at almost wide open throttle and still no RPM change and no movement up in speed (also still no loss of speed), during each occurrence the car was smooth (no engine bucking just wouldn't respond to gas input). The same symptoms have occured the three times it's occured. The resolve each time was the same, let off the gas for 1-2 secs, give it gas and the car drove again as normal. Dealership has looked at my car with no explination, no trouble codes were generated, and they stated tranny fluid was fine. It acted like the cvt was stuck on a particular band and also wouldn't allow any additional gas, hence no additional speed. The last occurance it was about 35 degrees out.

My dealership shop foreman said I shouldn't worry as I know there is fuel left when the gauge reads empty. But how much fuel?

Consumer writes in regards to vehicle hood and front seats issues. The consumer stated the first issue with the vehicle was a blinding glare that came from the rear of the 3.5 inch hood when the sun was high. The second area of concern was the trim or more importantly the lack of it on the front driver and passenger seats. The side trim on both seats wrapped around the front of each seat and abruptly ended. The consumer stated when a passenger or driver exited the vehicle, the heel of their shoes would occasionally catch on the un-finished end of the trim. Also, the mechanical equipment that operated the power seats were fully exposed. The consumer stated the only response he ever received from the dealer, was no fault codes found.

At the time I complained that the Navigation version was dated 2013-14. Nissan agreed to pay for the update when it was available. It is now over 2 years later and no update has been issued for my Navigation System. Of note is that the 2016 Murano has already received an update.I have been told by the Nissan Navigation site that the manufacturer has to push through an update and that Nissan has not made one available. Nissan blames the Navigation site for not having an update available (highly doubtful as the data is available for the 2016 model update?!?). Also, per the Nissan Navigation site, the average update occurs between 18-24 months. Since the version I have is 2013-14, it is now over 4 years old.With the way that roads have been changing in the Dallas\/Fort Worth area, the directions on the Navigation system are frequently wrong and may result in accidents when told to take a right exit which is now on the left. I believe that the Navigation System in the 2015 Murano is either obsolete or defective and Nissan knew this going in as the changed the system in the 2016 model.I would like all 2015 Murano owners to contact Nissan and keep on them to come up with an update or a fix. Alternately, ask Nissan for a refund for the cost of the Navigation system which is part of the $2000+ technology package. Please don't let them get away with this breach of consumer trust.","1455":"Factory GPS is obviously a joke. It will not guide you to anything except nearby restaurants or gas stations. Nissan should be held liable by the FTC and state attorney general.Update from Feb 2, 2017:It seems the OEM Flash Card contains instructions and routing that is not up to industry standards. Another issue with it is the automatic display of the route no matter what kind of driving you plan. So 95% of my non-GPS driving still has a moving map displayed. It is  a safety hazard to always have something moving in your perifferal vision and so every time you starte the car you have to reprogram the display!!!","1456":"Navigation is suppose to guide you NOT get you lost.

The GPS does not seem to recognize the Eastern Shore of Va as being part of the Delmarva peninsula and sends me south through Norfolk to Richmond and north through DC. I'm thinking bad map load or software load. The dealership thought bad hardware and damaged the dash in the process of replacing the audio\/nav unit. Same software and map set so no difference in problem. Verified other automotive manufacturers using Here.com maps route properly. Bad load for 2015 Murano.Update from Jun 24, 2015:The replacement Audio\/Nav unit has the same routing problem as the original and also has locked up when changing settings and has failed to read the sd card at times.  Another error  \"Navigation Launching Failed\" has also occurred.Update from Jul 9, 2015:Two attempts to repair by dealership have not been successful.  They are now telling me Nissan says the operation of the gps routing me 250 miles out of the way is normal operation.Update from Aug 5, 2015:Nissan Consumer Affairs acknowledged they can duplicate the problem with other vehicles.  They are continuing to investigate but have no timeframe for resolution.  I was advised it was my responsibility to periodically check with the dealership for possible fix.  Nissan Consumer Affairs said they would not put this in writing to me.Update from Jun 28, 2017:After 2 years a map update was made available to me but did not resolve the routing issue.  I opened yet another case with Nissan Consumer Affairs regarding this.  I was contacted by Nissan Consumer Affairs and was told they were aware of the issue but there was nothing they would do about it.I feel this is a safety issue and am very frustrated at having paid for the Murano and paid extra for the technology package only to have a GPS that can not calculate a reasonable route.","1458":"Small quarter size oil drops over the garage and parking areas.

It feels like the engine is lugging because the CVT wants to keep the rpm too low, I can shift to manual mode and still go the same speed but the vibration\/rumble noise will go away because the engine rpm will be more than 1000. Obviously I don't want to drive in manual mode all the time so simply driving in manual mode all the time is not the solution.The same issue also occurs when I'm going at a very low speed maybe around 5 mph such as when slowing down for a speed bump and accelerating again, when accelerating the Murano will make a distinct booming\/rumbling noise like the engine is lugging.Also, this issue happened from day 1 from the night I drove the car off the dealer lot at 32 miles. I thought it will go away after the car breaks in but now I'm at 3000 miles and it's still the same thing. I will address this to the dealer, and I hope they have a fix.I did a simple Google search and I found many complaints similar to mine, and some say Nissan states that this is normal, but I hope Nissan will realize that this kind of vibration is unacceptable, it makes the car seem very unrefined.And Nissan, just so you know, a new Murano Platinum is not exactly cheap, at $38k I could have bought a lot of other cars, I could have bought a new base model Lexus ES350 or a used Lexus RX350. And I bet the powertrain will be more refined in the Lexus. Or I could have bought a loaded Toyota RAV4 Hybrid and saved 4 grand.","1462":"Had it into the dealer and worked on it, it was better for about 2 months now it is doing it again. Problem is between 15 and 40 mph transmission should down shift and won't unless you hit the gas, if you are in heavy city traffic you just have to chug along or put the transmission in manual mode. It is becoming a real pain in the butt. Traded in a 09 Mazda for this and wish I had the Mazda back. The car looks great but not at all happy with the CVT tranny.","1463":"This is my third Murano. Had a 2009, 2012 with CVT. Never any issues. 2015 Nissan Engineers \"made improvements\" to an already reliable transmission. If it's not broke let's change it for the hell of it. Like every one else the car jerks and shudders as it \"seems to be hunting for the right gear\". Few months ago started getting some shakes at low rpm. Now it will shake at 20,30,45 mph. Also from a dead stop.Taking it to Nissan tomorrow to have them download some new software to correct the issue. I don't have much faith that will resolve it. If not I will PUSH for a replacement transmission. Hopefully Nissan has reengineered the CVT to fix the the issues.","1464":"After waiting over 2 weeks for parts; the shop worked on my car all day and still not done. Hopefully tomorrow. I'll keep you posted if this fix works.","1465":"At low speeds (15 to 30) the transmission is searching for the right gear. Seems to happen when coasting up to a stop sign\/light or following a line of cars with a variable speed between 15-30 MPH. This started to occur after 9500 miles and has happened now 4 times.With the first occurrence I thought there was a flat tire. The vibration was significant.The new Murano is a luxury model and this transmission problem should not be occurring.","1466":"I bought this car because of the edgy styling and quality I had with Nissan in the past. The problem with the cvt transmission occurs between 15 to 30 mph at around 1000 rpm. The whole car shudders violently as if you had a manual transmission and you are in third gear when you should be in first. Nissan replaced the valve body, but I can already tell it is started to act up again. I'm not sure if I should dump the car now or hope for a recall that actually fixes the problem.","1467":"Just wanted to add this in case others are having the same problem- seems like 2015 transmission issues are most common for Nissan Muranos of this year.","1468":"I have had this 2015 Murano at the dealership multiple times (5+) 1st I was told error code showing brakes are applying automatically when applying gas (allegedly replaced some sensor) Next I was told of a Software update it was allegedly applied. before I could get out of the dealership parking lot problem occurred yet again.Dealership is claiming no error code on transmission drive a couple weeks to allow for code is current state of issue resolution or lack of resolution. If you are familiar with driving a manual shift car it is as if I am in the wrong gear when it should be in 1st it is as if it is in 3rd or even 4th it jerks so bad. Revving to high RPM's brings it out sometimes but the fuel waste has grown to the point I am only averaging 16mpg.The other way I have found to circumvent this is to switch over to manual mode and drop it down usually 3 gears this occurs at speeds as low as 12mph Parking lot speed. also occurs around 45mph either time when switch over to manual mode it shows me in 6th gear so that is definitely to high a gear for 12mph. It has almost gotten me run over once due to when I pulled into traffic from parking lot press gas and nothing happened whatsoever this has happened multiple times as well.I had the same issue with the Pathfinder and after 2 transmissions went with the Murano, what a mistake!","1469":"I recently purchased a NEW 2015 Murano and after a few weeks I noticed the transmission whining and jerking when it would down shift while stopping so I took it back to the dealer and they had a tech ride with me ,then drive my car, then drive a new Murano off the lot before they determined something was wrong. After putting it on the computer I was told it was a software issue but they updated it and everything should be fine now.When I left it seemed like it fixed the problem but by time I got home about a 1\/2 hour later the same thing was happening so I called the dealer the next morning to make an appt to bring it back. I was told to drive it for a couple weeks to make sure the error code would show up when it was put on the computer, when I took it in they put it on the computer and said there was no error code so they could not do anything even though they could feel it not shifting right. I was told to keep driving driving it until my first oil change and they would put it back on the computer to see if there is an error code.When I asked what happens if there is not an error code I was told NOTHING!. How you have a brand new car with less than 1000 miles on it having transmission problems that the tech can confirm but the dealer can\"t do anything about it because there is not an error code?COMPLETELY ASININE!!!","1470":"One day after purchase, I took vehicle back and talked to salesman about transmission whining. He responded by saying it's prob cold, so I waited til 1st oil change. Mechanic says he can hear whining and started up a new Murano and said it whines too. I was told it should not be an issue. At approx. 6k miles I noticed jerking on highway and severe whining as vehicle stops. I took vehicle back to have it scanned. Was told they need to change valve body. It's been 2 wks, I'm still waiting on parts. Not too happy having problems at 11k miles.","1471":"This has been happening since I purchased the vehicle. Nissan has put it on their computer 3 to 4 times and never could find out what was wrong. Finally, it coded and now they are installing a new transmission. Very irritating since this is a new vehicle.","1472":"I'm not ready to scream just yet. Took the vehicle on it's first road trip to Florida. Trip there was uneventful. Day before we were heading back, noticed the car started jerking pretty abruptly when slowing down. A little concerni g since I'd been driving it for 3 months and never felt that before. Stopped, turned it off then started back up and on my way we go. It did this a few more times that day. Got up the following morning to make the trip home. Drove around town a bit and no jerking so got on the road. About 100 miles in to the trip, it started doing it again but this time at highway speeds while trying to accelerate. I would have to push the gas pedal to the floor to get it to stop jerking. To me, it seemed the transmission couldn't figure out which gear it wanted to be in. It did this several times but we did make it home. Took to the dealership where I purchased the day after we got back. Diagnosis was they need to replace the valve body of the transmission. Been exactly one week since I took in and they still have my vehicle waiting for the parts to arrive. I'm hoping this is the fix to the problem and not just some sort of bandaid fix. Will update when I get the vehicle back. Interested to know if anyone has had the same problem and what the fix was.","1473":"I was excited to buy a new 2015 Nissan Murano, White Pearl Platinum version. Less than a month, I was driving the car on the freeway and the car just start jerking. I exit the ramp and pull into a gas station and turn the engine off. I exit my vehicle and start to inspect it. Everything looked normal. I got leery and drove home.I took it up to the dealership and told them the problem. They assured me they fixed the problem. The next day it start jerking again. I thought it was bad gas or something. I call the dealership again and received a appointment to bring it in again. This time they checked it out and told me I need a transmission. I said a transmission and the car is brand new. I told them this is too soon to be having any kind of major problems. I don't want the car because I'm afraid I'll have more problems in the long run.The dealership contacted Nissan and told them their findings and also told them the customer is not happy with the car. Nissan contacted me and made a decision in a week, to fix the transmission and give the car back to me. I'm not happy with my purchased with Nissan. I could of bought me a vehicle from any manufacturer, but I chose Nissan and look what happened to me...I DO NOT WANT THAT NISSAN MURANO...What can I do???","1474":"Nissan Murano complaint, I purchased a 2016 Nissan Murano in may of 2016 and since I have owned it I have been having problems with the traction control system bogging down acceleration if I am coming off a curb cut or going over a pot hole or irregularities in the road.

Haven't even made my first payment on the car and barely put 1,000 miles on it.That's not the scary part. The issue was with the brakes. My wife was backing out of the driveway and her brakes stopped responding. She nearly hit a light pole and fence behind her, luckily she placed the car in drive and avoided that collision. Her next problem was that the car is now moving forward and brakes still not responding. She threw the car into park before colliding with our neighbors car. After calming my wife down, I asked my her to step out of the car so I can take a look for myself. When I got into the driver seat I noticed the brake pedal was almost to the floor. There was maybe about an inch of play on the pedal. Opened case with Nissan Consumer Affairs and was told there wasn't any recalls for my vehicle. A quick google search proved that to be untrue. Not happy being lied to.Arrived at the dealer to discuss the issue with the service adviser and he told me the recall was for cars ABS system. But it does not affect my vehicle. He proceeded to ask me several questions about the incident. One question that really bothered me was if we by any chance had bumped our car in the front end or maybe someone hit our front bumper. My answer was \"No, why?\" He informed that they have seen where people bump the front bumper and brake the sensor that works with the \"forward collision warning\" system. This system is supposed to apply the brakes before colliding with the car in front of you. Well he informed that if this sensor is damaged, they've seen that it causes the brakes to stop working. WHAT???? Nissan, are you f***ing kidding me. Please someone from Nissan engineering confirm this. Because if it's true, there lots of lawsuits coming your way.Luckily this happened near our driveway in a residential neighborhood, with no kids in the car because I dropped the kids off at school in my car this morning. Had this been at a busy intersection, thing could have turned out really bad. What if my wife decided to drop my kids off this morning and brakes failed by the school and hurt other children.Any Nissan executives reading this post, take a moment and think, what if this was your family in your product.

The dealer said wait till I had 3000 miles before I brought it","1499":"My 2016 Nissan Murano Sl with only 9000 miles has started jerking and hesistating when traveling at low speeds. I will be taking it into the dealership to have it checked.","1500":"Brand new 2016 Murano Platinum with barely 800 miles on it. Car started to hesitate and jerk when accelerating at low speeds -- like taking off from a stop or accelerating onto the freeway. Problem reported to dealership, but was not addressed. I'd taken the care in because the Service Engine light came on after refueling -- could be operator error with not fastening the gas cap properly or could be from the dealership service dept identified \"small leak\" on gas cap. Either way, Service Advisor said the gas cap problem should not have caused any hesitation or jerking. Picked up the car after leaving it overnight and on the way home, the jerking started again and became more frequent over the weekend. Made an apt at Dealership Service Dept --This ticks me off -- as an owner of a very expensive new car, why do I have to make an appointment several days to two weeks out to even get them to do some basic trouble-shooting, diagnostics? Once I purchased the car, what happened to all that good will about keeping me happy? Yes, they provide a free rental replacement when they keep the car, but it's a total hassle to spend over an hour dropping off a vehicle that shouldn't even be having any problems yet! End of rant.They've had my car since Thursday, 7 July, and today is Tuesday, 12 July. I received a voice message on Friday afternoon letting me know I should plan to be in the rental until at least the end of this week. Service Advisor said he would update me on Monday (yesterday), but no call or message. I called him this morning, but have not heard back from him yet. Initial message from last Friday said it is definitely a transmission problem and he has contacted Nissan and is waiting for them to send parts. I'm hoping to get some more definitive information about the specific problem and plan for resolution of same......but I'm very disappointed to have such a major problem with a brand new vehicle! My last car was a 2003 Murano that I bought new -- loved it and never had any significant problems with it. Decided to upgrade to the 2016 model because I'd finally gone over 100,000 miles on the 03 and it was beginning to need more than routine maintenance -- coils needed replaced, electronic door locks were failing, leather on driver's seat side had cracked, and the car had picked up some minor parking lot dings and scratches -- 13 years old but still had good shine and ran great. Guess I should have held onto it for another few years. Wondering if anyone else has experienced transmission issues with 2016 Murano.Finally was able to talk to the Service Advisor this afternoon and he told me they will be replacing the entire transmission. He said that's how Nissan does it -- when the transmission fails this soon, they want it back at the factory so they can break it down to figure out the problem. He said they had recently (did not specify which year) changed the CVT from being belt driven to chain driven so the CVT of this year is quite different from the CVT of my 2003 model. Interesting that with the solution being to totally replace the transmission, there never was an alert light or indicator saying there was a problem with the car. Perhaps that's why it gets a new transmission? With no magic code telling them what to fix, they're stumped? Hopefully, this will resolve the problem for good. Would still like to know if this is unique to my car or if there is an overall flaw with this model or the \"new\" CVT chain technology.Update from Jan 1, 2017:Solution was for Nissan Dealership to work with Nissan Headquarters to obtain a new transmission.  This wasn't an easy option, they had to provide video evidence of the problem, etc.  Because mileage was so low, Nissan wanted the faulty transmission removed completely and returned to their factory so they could \"autopsy\" it to determine root cause.  Dealership successfully swapped out the faulty transmission for a new one shipped to them from the factory.  Car was off road for nearly a month during this time -- dealership provided free rental car with no hassle.Since the transmission replacement, I have not experienced any further transmission problems.  Car now has just over 3,000 miles on it.Separate problem was identified as a very small leak in the evap system -- this is what would cause the Service Engine light to come on.  At first the problem seemed to be caused by failure to properly close gas cap after refueling.  After much insistence, the techs finally isolated actual leak.  New part ordered and replacement made.  Problem solved and Service Mgr conceded the problem was real and not caused by operator.All has been good since these two problems have been fixed by Nissan of Chesapeake.  Service Advisorswere Ray and Scott.","1501":"Had the vehicle for a week, as of yesterday and today while returning back from the gas station I drove over a set of train tracks(slowly as always) the nav, radio,information screen when black.

I took the vehicle back to the dealership the next day and they had 2 sets of Engineers come from Nissan to evaluate the issue. I was told they would look into the issue and would get back to me with a fix. After numerous calls to the dealership I called Nissan Cooperate and was advised that they did not have a fix at this time for this issue.

Every once in a while when I had a passenger in the front seat the air bag would deactivate. Originally the service manager stated that my purse must be to heavy and is knocking out the calibration. The second time I got a lesson on how to sit in the seat properly. Finally, Nissan admitted there was a problem and announced the recall. Since it was happening more and more frequently the dealer put me on the top of the list to call when they received the parts. Saturday I finally was able to bring the car in for the air bag OCS sensor recall repair. When I picked the car up after the service I noticed that the passenger air bag warning light stayed on continuously. According to the manual \"after placing the ignition switch in the on position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates. The supplemental air bag warning light will turn off after about 7 seconds if the system is operational\". I went back inside and mentioned it to the service manager and was told that was the fix that Nissan implemented. The warning light is now on constantly unless someone is in the passenger seat. This does not seem right and goes against everything in the Nissan manual.

Between two dealership I have made a total of 6 trips between the 2 dealerships. I keep getting a run around that this truck is designed for the compressor to run all year around, which I find that hard to believe. No way any car should be made for that to happen, otherwise it would affect gas mileage and performance and power.I took it in May 2015 two months after I bought it because I felt something was wrong with the way air and heat operated. I took it to Lander Nissan for them to look at it because they was closer to my house, he agreed of something didn\u2019t sound right under the hood when I turned on my air or heat but that it would take a few days to get me into the shop. The same day I took it on out to Wolfchase Nissan where I bought the truck, they had a guy to come out to listen he also was concerned on the sound the compressor was making when I cut on the heat, the compressor was clicking in and for me to bring it back in. I took in back up there like he said, the guy comes out there asking me what is it doing. I told him.He sat in the truck with me and we turn the switch from heat to air. Once he heard the sound of the air compressor coming on he told me that it is supposed to operate that way because new cars is set up that way. Late Sept I took it back to Lander Nissan for a oil change alone with having them to check this problem out again, they told me again that this is design this way.Fri Oct 2nd I couldn't take it anymore, I left work and took it back out to Nissan bc I know something was wrong now. Now that the weather has changed and I needed to run heat. The heat wasn\u2019t hot and again when I would turn the heat on you can hear the compressor engaging. He called and told me that its fixed and the problem was that it was a lose heater hose clamp in the cooling system not allowing the heat to get hot which in return caused compressor to come on.I was pleased at the point thinking that the problem had been taken care of and know that I wasn\u2019t crazy thinking that this was something going on in my head alone.. the minute I left the dealership I notice the heat wasn\u2019t getting hot still so I waited for the next day to call him back\u2026\u2026 he told me why don\u2019t I ride it out until it gets a little cooling in weather. I feel this way, if I want heat I should get heat likewise with the air and shouldn\u2019t have to wait until it get cooler outside..I am still please Nissan cars, but I just don\u2019t want this to prove me wrong about the Nissan maker of cars\/trucks..One good thing about it is I am still under my 3 years or 36.000 mile which will allow this problem to be corrected before out of pocket\u2026. at this point I will give him what he asked and maybe give it 2 more weeks and take it back in and let him ride in it alone with me to see what its doing because if it was only the heater hose why isn\u2019t the problem fix then","1571":"Had visited dealer twice and they had no clue and did nothing.

Why does Nissan not fix it?","1585":"shudder, jerking and finally engine failed while drivingI have a Nissan Pathfinder 2015 model which was bought last year from Arabian Automobiles Deira Dubai showroom and I have been facing jerking issues with this car from the beginning. Most of the time in slow speed I feel a jerk when the car is cruising and if I take my foot off the accelerator or press it harder it will stop. It usually happens at slows speeds when accelerating slowly.I had mentioned this issue many times during service and in 20K km service they told me that it is fixed by reprogramming the CVT engine. But again the same problem was there and last week in 50K km service they told that it is fixed permanently by replacing the CVT engine.Three days after the service I went for a trip with my family from Dubai to Salalah in Oman. While returning back the jerking problem started again and engine warning sign was showing in the car. It looked liked the gear transmission was not working properly and car was not moving forward even with full acceleration and rpm. I couldn't drive the car and I was stuck on the road in the desert at mid night for hours with my family and kids. I contacted Oman police for help they checked the problem and advised me not to drive. The car was then taken to Dubai border by recovery which costed me 1400 AED and my family came to Dubai border with Oman Police and then by taxi to home by paying AED 400. The leisure trip turned to be a nigtmare for me and my family because of the issue with car.Now I don't feel comfortable at all driving this car which has a manufacturing defect and which is having problems after service. I approached the service center to provide me a cash refund and there is no positive response from them. So I contacted Consumer Rights to help me to get full refund for my car and also to get the expenses the which I paid for Recovery and Taxi because of the issue with car.","1586":"I have the same shudder \/ jerking in the '15 Pathfinder that others have. I've had it into the shop 3 times to look at it. They always say that unless it \"throws a code\" there's nothing they can do. The 1st time I had it in, they said they couldn't duplicate the problem. I even went and drove it and couldn't make it do it. Over time, the problem got worse and more easy to replicate, so they wanted to ride with me the next time. The 2nd time I had it in (August 2016), the technician rode with me, with a computer hooked up to watch the transmission while it happened. He witnessed it and said the gear ratio was really low but it wasn't throwing a code. There was a software update available for the transmission at the time so they applied that. (Free of charge when there was supposedly a charge for updates.)I drove the car a few more weeks and maybe it's psychological, but ever since the update, my gas mileage was slightly lower (about 1mpg), the shudder problem was ever present at low speeds and it had even begun to slip very slightly going from Park to Reverse and again from Reverse to Drive. I called them back and they were optimistic that if it was starting to slip, then it would register it to the computer and have a code.I took it back in yesterday (September 27th) for a scheduled appointment and the first thing they did was check for codes. The slipping hadn't triggered any codes but the shudder now HAD! AND... there was a TSB released for it in April. The TSB states for them inspect \/ replace the valve body in the CVT, if there is a large amount of wear, then they are to replace the whole CVT.My car is scheduled to go back in next tuesday, (October 4th, 2016) to have them dive into the transmission. I'm hoping for the best. Wish me luck.Update from Oct 7, 2016:I took my car in on Tuesday.  They finally got the diagnosis and approval that the entire CVT needs to be replaced.  There was enough wear on the chain to warrant a full replacement.  It is covered under warranty.  It will likely take a couple of weeks for the repair, but they put me in a brand new Rogue as a loaner, so it's not too bad.","1587":"Not too long after buying it wife went out of town and jerking started. Really bad. Thought she got bad gas. It stopped and it has been intermittent since. Now it is happening all the time.","1588":"The transmission has gone out right after the noise started. It's at the dealership right now getting looked at. Nissan is making them take pictures with the oil pan off. Was told that right now its 50\/50 that the CVT will be covered under warranty. It's been at the dealership for about a 1.5 weeks before they even started looking at it. No loaner\/rental available. This one is definitely going down the road as soon as the tranny is fixed.","1589":"I purchased a new 2015 Nissan Pathfinder back in September 2015 and a few months after I got it it began jerking and shaking when I was driving around 20 mph I didn't think it was serious until a few months ago it started happening more often and the shacking kept happening more often. I read that this is a common problem with this car I so wish I would of known before I leased this car. It just feels horrible and not like a new vehicle. The performance is just one of the worse I ever experienced. So far I don't see any recalls I took it to the Delearship and they reset the computer but the problem continues and is worse will,take it to the dealership tomorrow again. I am ready to lemon the car or sue Nissan for giving me a car that has so many issues. Warranty better cover all cost and if the vehicle can't be fix I better get my money back and a brand new car.","1590":"Found this site while doing a search, I was so upset that our Pathfinder that we bought May 30, 2015 was not performing as it should, and wanted to see if anyone else was having this problem. It shudders at lower speeds and is getting worse.My husband has taken it to the dealership twice, once to be told they couldn't do anything about it until he could get a light to come on and again for service for which he had made an appointment for the technician to ride with him with a computer to get it to show on their computer, by the way which was a comment I found on this site, only to be told that nothing was showing up when they checked it, there were no recalls at this time and they didn't have time to ride out with him.Now we have been dealing with this dealership for years and have sent others to them also and right now I'm not a happy girl. When you pay this much for a vehicle, you expect more out of the vehicle and from the ones you bought it from to try and make it right. I hate driving something that I don't feel I can fully trust, at times I wonder whether it's just going to stop right then and there. I do a lot of driving around town at lower speeds, if I take off and go so far no problem, but in traffic and 30 mph zones not always possible.Well, that's my rant and I'm not giving up, if anyone has any suggestions please comment.","1591":"Shuddering was not resolved after 'software' update.","1592":"Purchased new pathfinder 2015 model and currently, 14,450KM run. It is being in good & smooth run while going long run whereas the city drive, especially slow moving under traffic, taking right\/left turn, the vehicle is getting jerked.

This problem must be re-solved.","1593":"My new 2015 Nissan Pathfinder has had this shuddering problem from day 1 but very faint, the vehicle now has 2100 miles and the shuddering continues to get worse when driving 10 to 30 miles an hour.

Guess they say anything to sell a car.","1594":"It started with the dreaded hesitating\/jerking thing I have read about Nissan CVT transmissions and only at 22k miles. The dealership stated it was a valve inside the transmission, and not the transmission itself. How is a valve inside the transmission not be a part of the transmission?!?! They needed to replace it and it will take approximately 3 days. They said if it MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. Wow, that is very comforting. If after repair, it continues, they will have to replace the whole transmission. Again, that is very effin comforting. Pardon my french.I thought Nissan already fixed this CVT transmission issue? We bought a Nissan because our 2006 Quest was great till we sold it this year (2015) for an upgrade. This will be our last Nissan.","1595":"The car suddenly increases torque and throttle causing the car to power through braking action.","1596":"The last cvt gear shift right before the car stop, the rpm jumps up and down causing the car jerk and speed up.

Please investigate.","1597":"This is a signal of transmission failure in a car. We should know, we've had THREE previous cars with transmission problems - an '02 Odyssey, an '07 Pathfinder, & a '14 Altima. And now this car. I bought it to replace our 2007 Nissan Pathfinder after transmission failed in that one. The transmission also shuddered and jerked in our 2014 Altima, so we knew to replace the transmission. Nissan replaced it under warranty. It's a shame that Nissan cars have this horrible issue that just ruins their reputation! I am TIRED of this! AND, it's the top-of-the-line trim! This car was totaled in a rollover accident in November 2015, and I replaced it with a 2015 Chevrolet Traverse. Hopefully it will be more reliable than this car!","1598":"We bought a new vehicle so we wouldn't have any problems for a while. That's not the case. After about a month (maybe two) it started to shudder every once in a while. I assumed it was suppose to do that until I was told that it's NOT suppose to do that. That's what the cvt is suppose to do, NOT SHIFT, and that's what it feels like. Then I find out it's also going on with the 2013-14 and there is a class action lawsuit with those 2 year models. I don't have another vehicle to get all my kids around in so I hope this gets resolved FAST!  As it stands right now, we won't buy another Nissan. Transmission is not the only issue I'm having either.","1599":"Despite assurance from Nissan Sales that there is extended coverage on the CVT, I am now being told there is not.","1600":"Car did not perform as it should.

What kind of car needs a warranty transmission fix with only 252 miles on it, especially a problem they know about already. Also they do not stand behind their product. This is my only car and within 1 week not I have no car to drive and Nissan doesn't provide a loaner or rental reimbursement for a inferior product that they are servicing right now. The only way they reimburse rental is if you buy theirsh*ttyextended warranty coverage and even then it only covers 4-5 days.Do not buy a NISSAN because they don't stand behind their products !","1602":"shudder, jerking while going 20 - 40 mphWe bought this car just a month ago 3\/25\/15.....brand new with only 195 miles on it.

Took it to original dealership (Beaman Toyota, Nashville, TN) at 5,000 maintenance service. They balanced all tires and aligned front end. Next day, still same problem. At 10,000 miles, took it to a dealership in my city (Ron Hibbard, GALLATIN, TN). They again aligned the front end and balanced all four tires. Stated tires improperly balanced. Drove vehicle for several days and noticed the shimmy was still there between 60-65mph. Went on Summer vacation. When returned, took vehicle back to Gallatin, TN dealership at about 13,000 miles. They worked with Toyota and got new tires approved. They suggested replacing DUNLOP tires with GOODYEAR WRANGLER tires. The put the new tires on and then \"force road balanced\" the tires. Told me the problem was fixed. Next morning, took my wife to work and still had the shimmy! Back to the dealership. Service manager doesn't know what to say. States they never had a problem like this before. It was as if I was making an untruthful statement about the shimmy. It was pretty bad. He took it for a drive and said it was characteristic of other 4Runners on the lot he drove. I asked to drive another vehicle from the lot. Prior to that, the Used Car Lot had a brand new 2016 4Runner traded in with only 780 miles on it! The sales manager agreed to let me drive it. I noted a \"slight\" shimmy at 60-65mph... It had DUNLOP tires - same as my original tires. The shimmy on that vehicle was nowhere as bad as my vehicle which now has 17,500 miles. The next day, the Service Manager and I took a brand new 4Runner SR5 (with Bridgestone tires) for a test drive. There was absolutely no shimmy in the steering!!! We then took mine out. It had some shimmy, not as bad as most days on the way into town with my wife. I spoke with the son of the dealership owner several weeks later while at the dealership. Mentioned the problem with my vehicle and said I would like to get it fixed. He said he was driving a Demo 4Runner and noticed a shimmy the first few miles he drove it. He wanted me to trade in my 4Runner and said he had no problem with the shimmy. Of course, that would be a big loss $$$-wise for me. On 10\/17\/2016, I contacted Toyota Customer Customer Experience Center and reported the problem. She kept asking me what I wanted. I kept saying I liked the vehicle, but would like Toyota to FIX THE SHIMMY! Gave her the complete rundown above. She contacted the dealer and they agreed to check it out again. I took it in yesterday morning. Got a call from the Service Foreman stating they checked everything out and couldn't find a thing. I advised they keep it overnight and take it for a test drive this morning and get it up to 63mph and they'll feel the shimmy. I also requested they take a set of wheels (with the Bridgestone tires) off their new 4Runner and put them on my vehicle and let me drive it overnight. I would drive it back in the next morning and tell them if that fixed the problem. He has to get permission from higher up. I mentioned Toyota had an open complaint case on this and they should help foot the bill for that so I can resolve in my mind whether this fixes the problem. I've read a lot on the different websites like \"toyota-4runn.org\", \"cargurus.com\" and \"edmunds.com\" and it appears there has been a \"LONG-STANDING\" history of problems with shimmy and vibration in the 4Runner. So, Toyota should not be dismissing this as a \"characteristic\" of the 4Runner or that \"they have never seen this problem before.\" This is my second Toyota and we loved the previous Toyota Highlander. However, if Toyota can't or refuses to resolve this, I do have other options (as Airlines remind us when we fly). So, I may just invoke other options to resolve a problem they refuse to fix...TOYOTA - if you are reading this, feel free to contact me and let me know what you can do to resolve this. I'm sure you can figure out who I am just by going to Ron Hibbard in Gallatin, TN...

I then parked the car in our driveway and left it in the sun all day, every day for a month. I had the windows down just slightly and a small fan in the car which stirred the air. I also put a large tray of activated carbon in the car, changing that material every few days. At night, I moved the car into our garage, rolled down all the windows and had an exhaust fan running, which changed the air in the garage several times an hour. After a month of that routine I was able to drive the car without getting a headache. Although I can still feel the effect of that polluted interior air, it is tolerable and improving with time. We now know that this out-gassing process never ends; it only lessens over time; and, contrary to what many still believe, it is also known that long exposures to extremely small doses of toxic materials can be more damaging to human health than a large, short exposure. Given these facts, I strongly suggest that our government add passenger compartment air quality to its safety rating protocol. The auto manufacturers certainly aren\u017cT going to do this of their own Accord.-Port Townsend, WA, USA","1706":"Vehicle navigation system reboots to default settings approx 1 - 3 times a week requiring driver attention to reset.

I ended up having to go back to using my garmin and my phone for directions.. it is a very cheap system and not worth the extra cost of having it in my Highlander. Missing addresses: To be perfectly honest, this probably isn't my last complaint. I've been annoyed by the inability of the Toyota nav system to find certain addresses which is needed for my travels.. there have been (at least) a dozen cases in recent months where I've tried to program in an address, but wasn't able to do so. The system uses a predictive text interface that restricts the available keyboard entries to make typing easier. And this is just here in my little Delaware co. NY I've had instances where, for example, I needed to enter a four digit address and the system only allowed me to enter three digits. It's as if the nav maps didn't include the full range of addresses along the road in question. And this includes several state I have been into and have tried to enter addresses.. and this a distraction in my driving especially when I am trying to find a motel.. for example I was on rt 90 in NY and wanted a hotel and asked please find me a motel along my route and it insisted no motels along my route..

On 4\/17\/2015, I bought a Toyota 2015 Highlander le plus from Toyota North brunswick (NJ) and noticed buzzing sound after driving only ~30 minutes. Buzzing sound comes from dashboard area constantly, ~once every minute (in the beginning of driving) to ~every second (after driving an hour). The noise is from the air blend servo (related to ac) as acknowledged by local Toyota service dpt, but Toyota keeps saying that the noise is normal no matter how often it happens because the regional Toyota field technical specialist (fts) [xxx] said so, I.e. Toyota can't help you. (note: He hasn't even checked my vehicle in person.) I think the noise itself can happen from time to time, but the problem is frequency, just like sneezing every second is not normal even though sneezing itself is normal to human. A Toyota technician told me the other day that replacing air blend servo is pretty expensive because the whole dashboard needs to be taken apart.

While driving approximately 65 mph, the subframe fractured due to the rear bolts on the frame being too tight. The vehicle was towed to a dealer where it was diagnosed that the rear bolts were not properly installed from the factory associated with the torque. The dealer inspected the subframe and stated that it did not need to be replaced. The dealer replaced the rear hybrid drive motor, rear differential, the entire exhaust system from the motor to the muffler, and the driver side suspension control arm. The contact stated that the subframe needed to be further inspected and replaced. The contact also waited longer than two weeks for the parts to receive the repairs due to the failure. The vehicle was repaired and the contact took the vehicle to another dealer who inspected the frame. The second dealer, a manufacturer's technician, further inspected the vehicle and stated that the subframe was cracked. The technician stated that the contact had the option of receiving a repair of the frame being welded or various parts would need to be removed to replace the subframe, which was an extensive repair. The contact was uncertain of the best course of action to permanently repair the condition. The VIN was not available. The approximate failure mileage was 11,562.

It's been two weeks and I haven't heard from them. I plan to go back in there today and make a fuss. The most irritating thing was the service person told me they KNEW about this problem and if I had brought it in before the screen broke they would have fixed it.

I can't emphasis enough how uncomfortable the front and 2nd row seats are. I have had the vehicle for three months and it is brutally uncomfortable. I can't bare to drive a care with such uncomfortable seats, so I will take the loss and trade it in on a Ford Explorer or GMC Acadia.

It's sad that I'm going to hold off on switching from a 2012 Sienna to a 2015 Highlander because of the poor seat design.What's wrong with the 2015 Highlander front seats? There's more padding behind the shoulders than there is behind the lower back. This causes the shoulders to push forward while arching your lower back in the wrong direction. This is one way to bring much pain and perhaps the beginnings of lower back issues.I liked the vehicle enough to consider upholstering the front seats but that would seem silly for a $40K car.I would hope that Toyota is aware of this seat problem and address the issue quickly.","1791":"We have 3,000 miles on our Highlander and we took a trip to Florida.

However, we are very unhappy with this vehicle because driver front visibility to the sides is obscured by the overlarge side view mirrors and the window frames; and backup visibility is extremely poor because the rear window design with turned up bottom corners, low placement of rear wiper, and small window size severely reduces what the driver can see when backing up. The backup camera does not clearly show rear obstructions when the car is parked in shade or shadows, or the driver is wearing sunglasses. These are major, crash inducing problems, which we reported to Toyota today. We narrowly avoided two collisions because we did not see vehicles approaching us from the side front of our vehicle; and we narrowly avoided backing into a parked car (in shade) which did not clearly show up on the backup camera. Two of these incidents were in parking areas; the third was driving into a left bend on a road as another vehicle approached head on. All three of these incidents happened in broad daylight, with dry road conditions. We have had this Highlander for only 7 months; and we are both very experienced adult drivers with excellent safety records, which our aaa insurance records will show.

We drove on the street for two minutes and we came to a stop light I braked to a complete stop, and the car died. The dash board screen said put your car in park and start the car. It was dark and many cars were behind me, waiting for me to start my car. We were afraid the car behind us would hit us. My daughters were sitting in the back seat, and my wife in the front passenger seat. I put it in park, tried to start. But it did not, so I pumped the accelerator, then it started. I drove onto the freeway on ramp, got on the 10 fwy heading East. Traffic was good at first, everyone was going 60 mph. Then suddently, the the freeway traffic was bumper to bumper and I had to brake to slow down quickly. When I did, the car died on me again. The dashboard screen said to put the car in park and start my engine. Now, we all began to panic because the cars behind us were going fast, and they might smash into us. We were afraid we would die or be badly injured by the collision coming. Luckily the car behind me stopped without hitting us. Once again, I put it in park, pumped my accelerator, and the car started. At this point, I decided, no matter how slow the freeway traffic is, I will L not brake, because if I do, the car will stall, and we can get hit by the car behind us.

The Customer Help line is a total misrepresentation \nof receiving any use full help what so ever.Other that you need a lawyer if you want your money back.\nThe Lemon law states you must have three failures, before you can apply for help with states lemon law policy. Who wants to have three total brake failures and false dashboard lights showing problems. That's only if your still even alive to apply for the law to help you at all.Moving on, the Dealership Manager was at least a honest fellow. He listened to our concerns and \noffered to buy the Highlander back from us. As their was no way, we could ever drive the Highlander again, after two total brake failures and other faulty electronics in the dash board notification system was very erratic. \nThe electrical problems that occurred on the instrument panel. This indicated to myself and wife that\nsomething was greatly amiss with the complex computer system, installed in our Highlander..We were very, very scared to even think of getting into our new Highlander.\nWith the service department manager\ntelling us that every thing is functioning properly?.The Dealership Manager thankfully purchased the Highlander back from us. Being retired our total loss was over $7,000.00 hard earned dollars and the whole experience, beginning with total brake failure, with the brake pedal on the floorboard and I pushing as hard on the pedal as humanly possible and the brakes not responding , has turned out to be a mental nightmare for I and my wife to endure and what followed .The Toyota Customer Service Help Line that we called. Was sympathetic, but never once helped or offered to help the situation. Toyota Customer Service Agents are trained to listen and be sympathetic with you. But that as far as it will go. \nTheir sympathy will not save your life. When breaks fail and your going out of control.Toyota Corporation let us down totally. Sold us a faulty vehicle, endangered our lives. Did nothing to help us.\nOnly to say The Toyota Company might buy the Highlander back, if we retain a expensive lawyer. All this after endangering our lives and all the mental pain of reliving everything that happened. Plus being retired and losing over $7,000.00 . Very distressing to us every day at what happened and our financial loss.Final Thought: \n We can only hope the who ever purchased this used vehicle, is still alive and not in a nursing home or permanently disabled or have their name beautifully engraved in a elegant piece of marble above them!.","1812":"When seated on front passenger right side the seat does return to normal shape. Contacted Toyota they refused to address the problem-New Market, MD, USA","1813":"We special ordered the 2016 Toyota Highlander limited platinum model. We purchased the vehicle in a town approx 180 miles away. I was the driver back home. I am 6' 1\" and wife is 5' 3\". we ordered the adjustable memory seats which are good. The safety problem we have experienced is the headrests. For shorter people they are tilted forward in a awkward position. Other than and up and down position there is no way to properly adjust them. My wife has complained that she cannot be safely positioned or comfortable driving with the headrest in the tilted down and forward position. Adjusting the seats does not resolve the problem either. This just makes the viewing more difficult creating blind spots. We paid over $52,000 for this equipment vehicle and expected comfort and paid for the extra safety features. However my wife is the primary driver (90%) of the time. Her safety as well as others she may not be able to see is most important. I immediately contacted the dealer and expressed the details and safety concerns as well as requesting a workable solution. The service department said there was nothing they could do. The sales consultant we purchased the vehicle ffrom said he was aware of these headrest complaints. He recommended doing what other drivers have he told us to reverse the headrests? I removed and reversed them. This did not accomplish a safe resolution. Instead the headrests sit back much farther enough that when there would be a collision the driver or front passenger could sustain severe neck injuries or worse possible paralysis or death. I can just place my head back enough to touch the headrests but I am then looking up to the roof. I immediately began a safety complaint and case with Toyota, I was told they would contact me in 7 days. It's 23 days later.

Called Toyota in July who knew nothing about an update but did receive a call from the dealer who set up another appointment. Took it back in and was advised still no update but they would replace the radio but could not guarantee the radio would not do the same thing.

New radio same problem, took back to dealer on 8\/22 for another update but was told this radio had the latest update available.  They, Toyota, suggested to wipe the radio clean and not link the I-phone or anything to it as this might have been the problem.  Nope still shuts down and reboots.  So now they will replace the radio again.  Third radio in 7 months.Update from Sep 8, 2016:Dealer replaced the radio again.  Still told not to link anything through it.  Two days after the third radio install same problem.  Now they want to keep the vehicle for a couple of days for a Toyota service representative that is more advanced to look at it.  Being told there are two other components that link to the radio that might be the problem.","1815":"I bought this Toyota Highlander 2016 new from the dealership. I reported the problem soon after I purchased the vehicle and it has continued to get worse as time passes. I have had over 40 conversations,with two different Toyota Managers, one at Auburn CA Toyota and another manager at Elk Grove CA Toyota, Toyota headquarters, and my claim manager. Eventually, after exhaustive emails and phone conversations they agreed to have a Toyota rep come and take a look. I took my car into the dealer for the second time and she took a quick picture and said that she'd send it to the engineers. They\/She deemed it \"normal wear.\" I asked if I could have friends and family members who have identical vehicles-yet older, bring them into the dealership for a direct comparison-they refused. Every other vehicle I've looked at, the seats look normal. They do not look like mine-rippled and unsightly like a poorly made, ancient couch.

I put the car in park and pushed the engine start\/stop button to turn off the car. My family and I exited the car and I used the keyless entry pad to lock the doors. We shopped for approximately 45 min. When we returned to the car, I used the keyless entry pad to unlock the doors so I could put our purchases in the trunk. As I got close to the vehicle I heard an engine running, but thought it was the car next to us. I bent down and listened under the front end of my Highlander and to my surprise, I realized my car engine was running. When I opened the driver side door and looked at the dashboard, I noticed a small triangular yellow caution light was flashing but I don't remember what the message said other than caution. If my car randomly starts on its own while its in a garage, it could cause toxic fumes to fill my garage if left on long enough, and could cause harm or death to someone who breathes it in. After reading about the brake\/hydraulic recall on some 2015-2016 Highlanders, coupled with the recent issue I had at walmart, I am nervous about driving my car.

I cleaned it thought a dirt. A week ago I noticed there are plenty of these spots on sides of car and lift gate. I took it to the dealership in Oakvile Ontario. The service manager said this is a dust can be polished. I told this is a rust, however he insisted this is a dust and he reported it to Toyota Canada as a dust and not rust. The nature of these spots they can be cleaned but they come back later becuase the root forb the rust still there. Unfortunately when I reported it myself to Toyota Canada they believe what the dealership saying. Fixing this problem by repainting will cause the car loose its value. It is Toyota factory problem to fix it in away that does not cause a loose to car value. This rust will keep growing and cause loose its value. The only solution Toyota must offer is replacing the car with another one with no paint defect. This is a big quality issue however it looks Toyota wouldn't be responsible on satisfying costumers.

I took my car to the dealership & let the service Manager drive it. He heard the noise & agreed that it's very loud & annoying. He then drove the other Highlanders on the lot & noticed that the other ones make the same noise. The service Manager has been helpful & has been talking to Toyota to try to resolve the problem, but it's been a month & nothing has happened.

Even after downloading new PCM and vcm \/ torque management software update provided by Honda, problem still exists. Honda states that they will continue to work on this fix, but corporate now states that this defect is within acceptable operating standards. On some days the shuddering seems unsafe and could pose a risk, I suspect, to driver and passenger safety.

Corporate rep met me at dealership to evaluate problem. He acknowledge problems during a test drive; stated that some cars just don't make it off the assembly line perfect, and that my vehicle is one of those vehicles. Honda corporate also states that the local dealership is in concurrence with their assessment, and I know for a fact that they are not based on discussions with them and with their service technicians who have worked on my vehicle.

I started driving it a year ago when we leased a 2013 CR-V for her. A couple of weeks ago, I was making the three mile journey to work when I noticed that my heat was no longer working. After work, the car had some transmission slip when leaving the parking lot. I stopped home briefly to make arrangements to take it to the local Honda dealer. We always had it serviced there ( mostly oil changes, a set of brake pads, etc. As it only had 84,000 mi. On it). On the way to the dealer, who was five miles away, the transmission was slipping more and more. Then, the vehicle started to massively overheat. I'm glad I was not on a busy highway or in heavy traffic. Long story short, after the technician evaluated it, I had a catastrophic failure due to the transmission fluid mixing with the antifreeze. I needed a head gasket for the motor due to the heat, a new radiator that had an internal design failure, and the transmission needed to be replaced as well. A vehicle does not require a mixture of antifreeze and transmission fluid anywhere, nor at any time in the history of automobiles. The repair would have cost nearly what the value of the car was. I called Honda motor Corp. And was offered no help. The value of the car was roughly $10,000. I chose not to proceed with the repair, as I felt it would have been a foolish decision. After my family has owned a half-dozen Honda vehicles, we will never buy another one. I feel that Honda owes me the value of the car due to their overly engineered radiator. We suggested that they put the value of the Pilot against the lease balance on the CRV, they denied that suggestion. The moment the heat went out, I had no idea that my car was already a total loss.

I have had it for a year now & it hasn't gotten any better but I only have about 5000 miles on it.","1854":"Seems when turning right mostly that brakes sometimes skip and sounds like a scraping noise and vehicle feels like it may not stop and it is very scary and I have 2 small children ages 3 and 16 months and I am taking my 2015 Honda Pilot in to Montclair Honda tomorrow morning 10-18-2016 for emergency evaluation!","1855":"This only happens when my car is warmed up, my brakes will skip, like I push them and than it skids.","1856":"my pilot wouldn't stop when i put it in parkWhile slowing down my Pilot with my foot on the brakes, I pulled into my mother's home's driveway. I am sure I put the vehicle into PARK. My Pilot proceeded to move forward and hit my mother's parked car. We were both very shocked - neither one of us could figure out what was happening. I couldn't stop the vehicle. (I've been driving without incident for 40 yrs.) I took my Pilot out of PARK, just trying to alleviate the problem in any way into DRIVE and then into REVERSE. The Pilot responded and I was able to move backward and away from the the bumper of my mother's car. Her bumper is cracked and damaged along with the trunk that needs repair. We are both fine, but shaken. I cannot figure out how or why this occurred. I brought the Pilot into the dealer, who was appropriately professional, but he decided that the problem was my error. Hopeful that it never happens again. Thank you.","1857":"I spoke with the dealership service dept. about this problem a few months after I got the vehicle, someone rode with me in the vehicle & said it was normal, that they thought the transmission was \"searching for the right gear\". at first it was just happening when slowing down & turning, since then it has gotten worse, it now happens at times just slowing then trying to accelerate, there is no throttle response for a short time, a few seconds, the engine just idles. I am going to talk with them about the problem.","1858":"Worked fine, then suddenly check engine light came on and no power. Called and was told I could try to drive home.

Been at dealer all week and they still do not have it fixed.","1859":"Again, my car was already warmed up, I put in in reverse and my engine made a popping noise and my transmission light came on.

Rest of trip 8000 miles and no problems.","1861":"We bought this car in October and have had it back to dealership twice. The second time it was there over a month. Same complaint-- car seems to shudder when trying to accelerate after reaching speeds of at least 50 mph and after taking foot off accelerator. Same problem occurs with cruise on and in hilly terrain. Between 50 mph and 70 mph. Response first time was software issue. Response second time was \"it is within Honda specs\". We have owned 3 Accords, one Civic, two Odysseys, two Honda Acuras, as well as this Pilot and have always been pleased. I have two big concerns. One is the problem stated and the other is the attitude from the dealer that it is \"within specs\". I have been told that Honda is aware and working on a fix. Meanwhile we have to deal with this shudder.","1862":"The seats are miserably uncomfortable -- the headrest tilts far too forward and cannot be adjusted.-College Station, TX, USA","1863":"The contact owns a 2015 Honda Pilot. The contact stated that while the vehicle was parked, it was discovered that the front passenger tire was flat. The contact retrieved the jack that came with the vehicle and attempted to lift the vehicle. The jack was elevated to its maximum height and there was not enough clearance to remove the tire. As a result, the contact resorted to using wooden blocks to elevate the vehicle high enough to remove the tire. The jack seized and another jack had to be used in order to remove the original jack. The vehicle was taken to the dealer but was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 500.

I started driving it a year ago when we leased a 2013 CR-V for her. A couple of weeks ago, I was making the three mile journey to work when I noticed that my heat was no longer working. After work, the car had some transmission slip when leaving the parking lot. I stopped home briefly to make arrangements to take it to the local Honda dealer. We always had it serviced there ( mostly oil changes, a set of brake pads, etc. As it only had 84,000 mi. On it). On the way to the dealer, who was five miles away, the transmission was slipping more and more. Then, the vehicle started to massively overheat. I'm glad I was not on a busy highway or in heavy traffic. Long story short, after the technician evaluated it, I had a catastrophic failure due to the transmission fluid mixing with the antifreeze. I needed a head gasket for the motor due to the heat, a new radiator that had an internal design failure, and the transmission needed to be replaced as well. A vehicle does not require a mixture of antifreeze and transmission fluid anywhere, nor at any time in the history of automobiles. The repair would have cost nearly what the value of the car was. I called Honda motor Corp. And was offered no help. The value of the car was roughly $10,000. I chose not to proceed with the repair, as I felt it would have been a foolish decision. After my family has owned a half-dozen Honda vehicles, we will never buy another one. I feel that Honda owes me the value of the car due to their overly engineered radiator. We suggested that they put the value of the Pilot against the lease balance on the CRV, they denied that suggestion. The moment the heat went out, I had no idea that my car was already a total loss. Can you say recall\"????????\"-Holland, MI, USA","1872":"Almost immediately after purchase, notice car shuddering and shaking at 35-50mph and then even higher speed limits. Went to purchasing dealer service department and they told me this is a common problem associated with vcm system. Took car for three subsequent repairs over next year to another Honda dealer. Even after downloading new PCM and vcm \/ torque management software update provided by Honda, problem still exists. Honda states that they will continue to work on this fix, but corporate now states that this defect is within acceptable operating standards. On some days the shuddering seems unsafe and could pose a risk, I suspect, to driver and passenger safety. Have followed all lemon law guidance from state of Georgia and Honda continues to produce lies and false statements to cover up a problem which has even been written about by edmunds.com. Corporate rep met me at dealership to evaluate problem. He acknowledge problems during a test drive; stated that some cars just don't make it off the assembly line perfect, and that my vehicle is one of those vehicles. Honda corporate also states that the local dealership is in concurrence with their assessment, and I know for a fact that they are not based on discussions with them and with their service technicians who have worked on my vehicle. Honda should be ashamed of how they are ignoring an operating problem with this vehicle; expanding acceptable tolerance limits in order to call this vehicle normal and safe.-Roswell, GA, USA","1873":"2015 Honda Pilot.

Not sure the reasoning or really after almost 3 weeks what exactly is going on. I have had 0 contact from the service department and have been driving around in a Honda Accord for 3 weeks and making a payment for a Honda Pilot. Ridiculous. I have been jerked around from the dealership from the very start. Their first question when I called to see what I need to do was that they needed to confirm I had a warranty.... Um, 6,000 miles, did you not hear me. Took 5 hours to get my car there due to the run around.I was told they will work with me and get me my same vehicle as wash so I would feel safe and happy, especially being a loyal customer. That is not happening. I feel I have been walked on, taken advantage of and still do not have my car. I could go on an on. Bottom line is I expected far more than where I am currently with this issue.","1876":"Wife took car to dealer when she noticed the check engine light and the Vsa light were on.

Then released paddle & it started scrolling. Somehow managed to reached home with lots of shaking & weird noise. Today called a dealer & they asked to tow it to them. Will post update after dealer visit.Update from May 3, 2016:Okay, after I visited dealer, they said there seems to be an issue with some part ( I don't exactly remember the part name now).

Tech gets in and FINALLY gets to see, hear, and feel every thing I have been saying that has been going on for weeks!! they keep and for days and finally they say the THINK its the coil which wasn't replaced because it wasn't damaged, however and I quote \"we took coil 1 and coil 2 and just switched them around, and I mean we have driven it and all and it seems to be working fine\" So i asked switching the coils from one spot to the other is the fix..they said yes because the coils are not damaged they were just loose, and the manufacturer might have just put them on loose! well we will see if the problem is REALLY fixed!if there diagnostic machine didn't tell them that the coils were damaged I mean it must not be damaged RIGHT???

Had my wife been driving with my daughter in the car, I would have flipped out. To have a car lose power on the interstate can be deadly.I stopped by work before taking the car in, just to check in. When I re-started the car, the check engine light was on, but now so was the traction control light and VTM light. I dropped the car off at the Honda dealer near work and was told that it is rare that a new Honda has this happen. That makes me feel worse, as I may have bought a lemon. If this happens again, I'm going to push for a new SUV.Update from Aug 27, 2015:Dealer said that one of my fuel injectors went bad.  They were surprised that one went bad so quickly, which makes me worry that perhaps I got a bad batch of injectors.  These are only covered by the 3yr\/36k bumper to bumper I believe.  They didn't have the part in stock and had my car for 3 days, although they gave me an Enteprise rental car.So far the Pilot is fine now.  That said, I'm going to constantly worry about it happening to another injector, perhaps with my daughter in the car.

Took it back to the dealership and they lubricated it and said it was working fine. It still continued to feel too tight - especially when compared to the passenger side. So, I stopped by a Honda dealership and tried the seatbelt in one of their 2016 models and found that it had the same snugness as my vehicle. I have since measured both the driver's seatbelt and the front passenger seatbelt. The result was that the driver's side belt is a full 24 inches shorter than the front passenger belt, when fully extended. I feel that if it is tight on me, it could pose a problem for others as well. It should be noted that, even though the belt was a little snug, I really did not notice it until I was wearing bulky winter clothing and heavy coat.-Reading, OH, USA","1883":"I write to you to convey my safety concerns regarding a new Honda 2016 Pilot. My attempts to resolve my concerns with american Honda motor co., Inc. Were met with tepid reluctance and a cavalier neglectful attitude. 1.at high speeds (55-75 mph) the vehicle oversteers and during emergency avoidance maneuvers becomes unstable. Twice while avoiding dear on interstate highways, I have almost lost control and was seriously concerned about rolling the vehicle over. I own and have driven a 2003 Pilot for over 180,000 miles and never experienced this sort of issue. I believe the suspension is incorrectly designed and that unexpected and unnecessary rollovers are imminent. 2.the \u017cauto idle off\u017c feature turns the engine completely off at certain times and under certain circumstances. It takes between 900 and 1,300 milliseconds to recover power to the wheels when this happens. Unlike hybrid vehicles (from which this feature was taken), there is no alternative electrical motor to provide torque to the drivetrain while the engine restarts and as a result, there is delay in accelerating. In the vast majority of times, this is of no consequence however in a small fraction this delay increases the risk of collision. About once per week, I experience a delay in entering dense traffic within short interstate merge lanes. This delay of about one second is enough to remove my margin of error and increases the risk of collision during a merging maneuver. While there is a switch to defeat this feature, it resets every time the vehicle is turned off and remembering to override it every time is inconsistent with human memory and performance.-Pittsburgh, PA, USA","1884":"I was driving in the rain at about 30 miles and hour towards a red light.

I have only driven it 2,000 miles but observed these many times. I reported these to the dealer and was told the car was fine. Adaptive cruise control issues: - fails to detect vehicles in odd situations, such as a truck where the rear of the body protrudes out from the rear wheels, as if the radar is only at ground level, or if a vehicle is driving in my lane but one tire is in the other lane, or a wide load which occupies all of the adjacent lane and half of my lane, or a \"bobtail\" truck. - after an empty stretch, upon coming up to a slower car, rather than slow gradually by easing off the gas, the car will get very close to the car and then rapidly brake, causing drivers behind me to nearly rear-end me. Collision mitigation: - all of these trigger \"brake\" messages to be displayed, which is just 1 step before the brakes being auto-applied, which could cause me to be rear-ended. - false alarms while merging from lefthand onramps where a pending collision with the jersey barrier is detected - false alarms by the hills adjacent to the road when going around a sharp turn on back roads - false alarms when cresting a hill with a curve after the hill and it thinks an oncoming car will be hit, because it can't see the lane markings past the hill lane keep assist: - partially goes into exit ramps on its own if in the right lane, causing other drivers to think I am leaving the lane and start to merge themselves - is confused by lines of tar and will depart the lane on its own - often \"fights\" with the lane departure mitigation around corners - tries to prevent me from giving other vehicles some buffer when passing them, if they are wider or drifting toward me. - does not alert when it stops being able to detect the lines-Gaithersburg, MD, USA","1886":"I have the Honda AWD 2016 touring model with Z transmission.

The first incident occurred in May 2016 on a busy city street with our three young children in the car. While in motion, the car essentially shut down with the display screen showing a series of warnings indicating numerous system failures. There was no engine power but luckily I was able to coast the vehicle to a nearby parking lot. The dealer indicated there was no problem, just a computer glitch, and the only repair necessary was to reset the computer\/software. The second incident occurred last week, only this time while driving on the freeway. We completely lost all engine power but luckily I was in the right lane and I was able to coast to the side and pull over on the shoulder. If I had been in the fast or middle lane with little opportunity to move over, there could have been a serious collision. Similar to the first incident, we were unable to start the car with the warning lights showing various system failures. We had the car towed to the same dealer who initially indicated they would just reboot the software again. So we pressed upon them to do a more thorough diagnosis since this is the second time its happened. They agreed to keep the vehicle and seek to identify the root cause of the problem. At this point no diagnosis has been made. We would have never expected this from a near brand new (purchased in December 2015 and currently has only 9,200 miles) Pilot elite loaded with safety and technology features. Again we experienced two separate incidents where the car immediately shut down while in motion with the most recent occurring on the freeway. And both times our three young children were in the vehicle. This is a huge safety risk and I certainly hope Honda does its due diligence in diagnosing and addressing this issue.-Sacramento, CA, USA","1895":"This is a follow up to complaint 10881962 in which one of my fears has come to fruition. I was driving my car in the normal mode (acc and lkas disabled) on a normal two lane paved road when the car in front of me made a slow right turn. I was not following very closely and came to a complete stop on my own to avoid running into the other car. I stopped about 15 feet away from the other car. The other car then completed the turn to the extent that the other car was no longer in the way of me driving forward in a straight line. When I pushed the gas to then proceed the collision mitigation system started flashing the \"brake\" message and producing an audible warning. At this point I was possibly going 10 mph again. After verifying that there was definitely not anything in my way, I kept applying the gas. My car then started braking on its own, at which point I pushed the gas harder to presumably over-ride the braking. A moment or two later, my car then made a sudden and hard brake on its own that brought my car to a complete stop, despite the fact that I was pushing hard on the gas. The other car that had turned was well clear of the lane by this point, and was easily 1 ft away from my path of travel when I started accelerating in the first place. My only explanation is that the collision mitigation system was confused by the lack of a shoulder lane marker (only a raise cement curb was present) and somehow thought the car was still in the \"road.\" In either case, the system malfunctioned to the point that my car was suddenly brought to a complete stop, and the car behind me very nearly rear-ended me in a situation where I had already come to a stop, and the obstacle in front of me had cleared \/ continued to become increasingly more clear of my path. The situation was dangerous and clearly misinterpreted by my car.-Gaithersburg, MD, USA","1896":"Honda Pilot 2016 touring. Vehicle battery drains overnight or in a few hours for no reason. The vehicle would not start and would have to be transported to the dealership or have battery recharged for a long time. After recharge, safety equipment such as sensors, emergency stop, etc. Stop working. Contacted Honda and took vehicle to dealership multiple times. One time they replaced the battery and other times did something else but they are unable to resolve the problem. We believe vehicle is unsafe to drive. This problem seems to be encountered by many Honda Pilot 2016 owners which is reported online. They all complain of taking their vehicle to Honda dealership only to be told the dealership unable to resolve the issue.-Rancho Cucmaonga, CA, USA","1897":"I had a 2014 Pilot. The navigation worked great. Now I own a 2016 Pilot and most of the navigation system is locked out while driving. I now have to pull over in the city or interstate to make changes--both dangerous.

I have only driven it 2,000 miles but observed these many times. I reported these to the dealer and was told the car was fine. Adaptive cruise control issues: - fails to detect vehicles in odd situations, such as a truck where the rear of the body protrudes out from the rear wheels, as if the radar is only at ground level, or if a vehicle is driving in my lane but one tire is in the other lane, or a wide load which occupies all of the adjacent lane and half of my lane, or a \"bobtail\" truck. - after an empty stretch, upon coming up to a slower car, rather than slow gradually by easing off the gas, the car will get very close to the car and then rapidly brake, causing drivers behind me to nearly rear-end me. Collision mitigation: - all of these trigger \"brake\" messages to be displayed, which is just 1 step before the brakes being auto-applied, which could cause me to be rear-ended. - false alarms while merging from lefthand onramps where a pending collision with the jersey barrier is detected - false alarms by the hills adjacent to the road when going around a sharp turn on back roads - false alarms when cresting a hill with a curve after the hill and it thinks an oncoming car will be hit, because it can't see the lane markings past the hill lane keep assist: - partially goes into exit ramps on its own if in the right lane, causing other drivers to think I am leaving the lane and start to merge themselves - is confused by lines of tar and will depart the lane on its own - often \"fights\" with the lane departure mitigation around corners - tries to prevent me from giving other vehicles some buffer when passing them, if they are wider or drifting toward me. - does not alert when it stops being able to detect the lines-Gaithersburg, MD, USA","1899":"We are experiencing a snap\/clunk that can be heard and slightly felt through foot when applying or releasing the accelerator and also application of the brake.

The sunroof glass had spontaneously shattered. When I looked through my rear view mirror I could see some pieces flying. Thankfully, the car behind me was far away enough that they were not hit by these glass pieces and also had my interior slider closed. A serious accident could have occurred if both my slider wasn't closed and\/or the car behind me was close to me. I've had the car for less than 3 months, I contacted Honda and advised them of the incident and brought it in to their service department. They claimed to have never heard of anything like this happening before. They have ordered a replacement glass for my sunroof. I'm still waiting for it come in. I also went online and researched sunroofs breaking out of nowhere and did come across many other similar complaints. It seems that it may be happening more frequently with newer vehicles because they are built lighter with thinner metals and thinner glass. The glass used on sunroofs more commonly is tempered glass, not laminated glass. Tempered glass is more prone to shattering when pressure builds up inside the car. When I spoke to Honda corporate and the dealer, neither one could tell me what kind of glass was on the sunroof because they didn't know. I hope this matter can be further looked into. I hope it doesn't happen again. This was a very frightening experience that could have very easily been worse.-Yonkers, NY, USA","1902":"I write to you to convey my safety concerns regarding a new Honda 2016 Pilot. My attempts to resolve my concerns with american Honda motor co., Inc. Were met with tepid reluctance and a cavalier neglectful attitude. 1.at high speeds (55-75 mph) the vehicle oversteers and during emergency avoidance maneuvers becomes unstable. Twice while avoiding dear on interstate highways, I have almost lost control and was seriously concerned about rolling the vehicle over. I own and have driven a 2003 Pilot for over 180,000 miles and never experienced this sort of issue. I believe the suspension is incorrectly designed and that unexpected and unnecessary rollovers are imminent. 2.the \u017cauto idle off\u017c feature turns the engine completely off at certain times and under certain circumstances. It takes between 900 and 1,300 milliseconds to recover power to the wheels when this happens. Unlike hybrid vehicles (from which this feature was taken), there is no alternative electrical motor to provide torque to the drivetrain while the engine restarts and as a result, there is delay in accelerating. In the vast majority of times, this is of no consequence however in a small fraction this delay increases the risk of collision. About once per week, I experience a delay in entering dense traffic within short interstate merge lanes. This delay of about one second is enough to remove my margin of error and increases the risk of collision during a merging maneuver. While there is a switch to defeat this feature, it resets every time the vehicle is turned off and remembering to override it every time is inconsistent with human memory and performance.-Pittsburgh, PA, USA","1903":"I had just pulled out of my garage when the tailgate window on my eight day old, 2016 Honda Pilot forcefully exploded. It blew shards of glass 15 feet behind the vehicle. The force broke the rear window wiper and bent the window wiper arm down. All this occurred while I was travelling about 5 to 10 miles an hour. The car was completely out of the garage, but not far from it. No one was around the car. My husband was in the back yard and heard the explosion. Our Honda dealer said we pressed the wiper into the window causing pressure which broke the window. I was driving alone in the car. If anyone had been behind the vehicle they would have been shredded by flying glass. It didn't drop to the ground it flew 15 feet behind the car. This presents a dangerous situation if people are nearby as on a city street or parking lot. From the internet I see this has happened to many other vehicle makers, not just Honda.-Fairport, NY, USA","1904":"On 3 separate occasions, our 2016 Honda Pilot elite has completely shut down while we were driving - twice on the highway and once in busy traffic. When this happens, the engine, transmission, power steering, etc. All stop working and the car displays every error you can imagine. I have posted a video here: Https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?V=btebmywy-is this is very scary because there is nothing you can do to get the car working again - luckily, we have been able to coast to the side of the road. When it first happened, we called Honda emergency roadside assistance and we had a tow on the way when we tried restarting the car several times in a row and that cleared the errors. Since then, we have used the same trick to get the car running again but it has happened twice in the last week - very scary! I have found other similar complaints online so it's clear that there's some kind of computer or electric problem with this model - it's just not obvious what triggers it. We are going to try to trade in our car for a different model because Honda has not been able to provide any help in spite of the fact that we have taken it to the dealer 3 times - I am very disappointed with their service on this.-Glenview, IL, USA","1905":"Coming to a stop at an intersection it has surged 4 times taking me out into the intersection every time, with foot off gas an on break I can not stop it.

Besides ourselves, we had our two young grandchildren in the car. The car's computer started displaying a changing series of warnings generally indicating various system failures. The car basically started to shut down. Since we were in the far right lane, my wife was able to coast over to the shoulder. If we had been traveling in the middle or left lane of traffic, there would have been little if any chance of moving over to the curb. The car, with two young children in the back seat, would have shut down leaving us in the path of very fast moving cars and trucks. The only outcome was a potentially deadly high-speed rear end collision. We had to have the car towed to our Honda dealer approximately 40 miles away. On November 27, the day after thanksgiving, the same failure occurred at approximately 2:30pm. This time we were 400 miles from home traveling East on highway 11-E, between greeneville and johnson city, Tennessee. I caught the failure early enough before the engine shut down and was able to coast the car to a parking lot of an out-of-business store. This time instead of two young children, we had two elderly great grandparents. The dealer that handled the first incident diagnosed the problem as a software issue. However, the second dealer diagnosed it as a fuel pump relay not properly connected. This relay requires a special tool to install it.

Since we were driving through St. Louis this was justified in my mind as okay since it was most likely just a stray bullet, but upon closer inspection the sunroof exploded upwards and there were no bullet rounds to be found. (bummer) There was a Honda dealer a couple miles away from the incident, and they got us in a courtesy car right away (Frontenac Honda is awesome) ... and the Honda national office said they would cover the replacement cost. (Way to step up Honda)After using some tweezers to remove the glass from my arm and forehead I found myself Googling exploding sunroofs which brought me here. Apparently it's a thing. Wtf mate? I guess I shouldn't feel special since it is a thing, but why is it a thing? Just put a piece of clear film on it or make it out of plexiglass. Come on car engineers. You promise us flying cars by 2001, and instead we're still rolling through post industrial wastelands in 2016 rocking 23mpg with exploding sunroofs?! Talk about a raw deal.

As I pulled out of a parking lot, my display panel showed emissions system problem and the engine light came on. Called dealer and they said it's not a big concern unless engine light was flashing and to bring it in after the weekend (was a Friday afternoon). Drove it 30 minutes home at 55-65 mph and noticed no problems. Drove it that distance and speed to take it to the dealer as well with no problems. Picked it up a few days later. Service notes indicate: Code P0328, knock sensor failure, replaced knock sensor and retested, ok at this time. After picking it up, was about 10 min away and trying to go from 60 to 68 and set cruise. Speed began to jump around, not staying at a speed for more than a second 70-60-65-68-63, etc. Engine light now flashing took off cruise and it continued. Turned around to head back to dealer.

Stepped off brake and car accelerated on own to 25. Dealer notes: Code P2638, idle relearn, torque management feedback, performed relearn. Today, 6 days after picking it up, I was stopped at a stoplight. Eco button is on, engine idle is running, seat warmer and heater on. While I was still applying brake, the engine idle sounded like it was trying to kick off and the whole car shut off on me.

When driving around in about 30 mph, seems the transmission has difficulty in shifting gears as if it cannot decide if it needs to move up or down the gear. Then it seems to get stuck in the lower gear and feels like as if the gears are grinding. I can also feel the gears grinding in the acceleration pedal. At this point, I am able to smell metal burning through the air conditioning - seems like the transmission is getting overheated.

The first incident happened about a month ago before the vehicle even had 900 miles on it and it has re-occurred numerous times since then and we only have 2,000 miles on it. It appears that if you decelerate rather quickly from let's say 50 mph+ to zero, that when you re-start from zero, the transmission is all out of sorts. When you hit the gas at zero (after the fast deceleration) the vehicle will be very hesitant\/slow to start (almost as if you\u017cre starting in a higher gear than 1st) and then when you get to about 25-30 mph, the vehicle will slam into that gear and shake the entire vehicle. That 'slamming into gear\u017c issue will continue every time you drop down or accelerate to that 25-30 mph range during that driving session. The only way to get the issue to stop during that driving session, is to stop the vehicle and re-start the engine. It's almost like it resets the transmission or the computer that runs the transmission\u017c there are no check engine lights\/warnings that come on and it's a hard issue to duplicate, but the only thing that seems to make it occur sometimes is fast deceleration from a high speed down to zero (I.e. coming off an off-ramp and hitting a stop light, or driving on a 50mph type road and then hitting a stop light). There's obviously a major transmission flaw and the continued \"slamming into gear\" when this issue occurs, can only be doing more damage to the transmission and feels like the engine is on the verge of locking up.-Barre, MA, USA","1918":"While the car was in motion on a country road, warning messages came on stating that the car should not be driven, and then the engine suddenly shut off.

My wife was driving with our 4 children and was able to pull to the side of the road. She pulled over, turned the car off and a sheriff stopped. The sheriff recommended she try to continue to drive to get the car off the highway since they were in a very dangerous area. My wife started the car and proceeded to ascend to the nearest off ramp and when numerous warning lights came on and the car rapidly decelerated once again.

In that case, the 2016 Honda Pilot jerked violently before decelerating. My wife immediately pulled the car to the side of the freeway and had the car towed to pacific Honda. Honda determined that our Pilot was unsafe to drive and needed an entirely new transmission and replaced the transmission in the 4-month old vehicle. Honda reassured us the car was now safe.

Honda needs to fix this now. There are many people having the same issue. No one knows how to fix it in the service dept. So are they going to wait until someone is dead? with all the problems popping up with this vehicle, I am starting to think I made a mistake.-Clay, NY, USA","1934":"Driving at freeway speeds I noticed the hood was shaking. This car has about 3500 miles on it. I pulled over to check the hood to ensure it was secure, got back up to freeway speeds and it continued to shake. It looks like it might fly off at any time. Also concerned about fatigue of the joints over time due to the vibration.-Oro Valley, AZ, USA","1935":"Since purchase 3 months ago, the hood shakes violently at speeds above 55 mph and especially under windy conditions. It is exceptionally bad in high wind and when passing oncoming vehicles. It is obvious the hood is not sufficiently strong enough to withstand these wind pressures without causing some kind of damage in the future. Feels like it is only a matter of time before the hood actually bends or breaks at 80 mph highway speed limit.-Great Falls, MT, USA","1936":"At high speed and especially when passing oncoming large vehicles hood shakes violently as if coming loose and threatening to fly up.. greg may Honda of waco tx service department was useless in resolving.-China Spring, TX, USA","1937":"The hood vibrates violently in speeds of 60+ miles an hour. When a large truck or vehicle drives passes the car the hood vibrates violently. When on a two lane road and on coming traffic goes by the car the hood vibrates violently. This issue has been present since I purchased the car in June 2016. The Honda dealership stayed this was within the design specs for the Pilot. I have made every adjustment I can make with the rubber grommets with no success. Honda tells me ther is no adjustment. I am a port enginner and I manage ship repair. This is a serious issue. The vibration will over time cause the hood hinges to fail from fatigue. This will create a situation where a consumer driving the 2016 Honda Pilot to potentially have hood fly off the vehicle during normal driving causing catastrophic failure and injury to the driver and passengers.-Moyock, NC, USA","1938":"My family was in our 2016 Honda Pilot touring. We stopped our vehicle and started to get out. My eleven year old niece was sitting in the middle seat of the second row. She was in between my two sons, both in carseats. When she removed her seatbelt the belt quickly snapped back and the buckle hit my three year old in the head. He was sitting in his forward facing carseat that is appropriate for his age, height, and weight. His seat is on the driver's side of the second row. The buckle hit him on the right side of his forehead right under his hairline. Two large knots, one for each side of buckle, popped up. One knot was large enough that it actually split open and bled. It was incredibly painful and took almost two weeks for bruising to go away.-Mount Vernon, KY, USA","1939":"I am experiencing the same issues others mentioned of the hood flexing when driving. Under certain conditions when driving down a two lane highway and a semi goes by in the other direction or when passing a semi on the interstate you can see the movement of the hood from the front to the back as the air flows underneath. It looks like the hood lifts from latch and then flexes, moves or shakes as air flows guess that's best way to describe it. On the interstate I have even noticed shaking\/movement when driving if it's windy without passing a semi. Car wash dryer also causes the hood to shake. I have taken to dealer and they tried adjusting the latch - that didn't help. Stopped by another dealer and they said to adjust the rubber bumpers on each side under hood but that didn't help either. It's pretty scary to see this happening. What if the latch doesn't hold one of these times\" the hood flying off going 65-75mph is not a pleasant thought. Over time will the flexing and movement and the hood cause paint to crack and decrease integrity of the hood\"-Alamosa, CO, USA","1940":"We were driving down the street, veering left and the rear passenger door attempted to open. A warning went off on the instrument panel showing which door was \"open\". because the door was locked it didn't open all the way. In order to close it the driver had to push the unlock button. Had the door not been locked I'm afraid the door would have opened completely, putting my passenger at risk.-Lithonia, GA, USA","1941":"When's next motion going about 50 mph or above, traveling on a two lane road, and a large truck passes us going the opposite direction, the hood flexes quite a bit. Also flexes and bounces when going through the drying stage at a car wash. It is extremely noticeable and concerning. I am concerned with the possibility of it lifting and becoming a safety issue to either myself or the cars behind me.-League City, TX, USA","1942":"I have a 2016 Honda Pilot elite and I noticed on my last road trip that the hood on the vehicle moves violently when I pass on coming vehicles especially large trucks. I also noticed that this happens during high wind situations as well. I made a service appointment for this week to address this with Honda. On both occasions I experienced this was at highway speed of 55 or faster.-Wichita Falls, TX, USA","1943":"Engine hood bends in all directions in high winds & when passing commercial trucks: Looks like it will come off at any moment, to strike the windshield. Experienced this on the same highway on every trip from California to Arizona and back.speed was 75 mph (legal limit). Will video tape this on the next trip.very frightening! has been to dealer three times re this issue: They have no answers and no repair offered.-Prescott, AZ, USA","1944":"While driving straight on a highway, I heard a loud noise from the top of my car. The sunroof glass had spontaneously shattered. When I looked through my rear view mirror I could see some pieces flying. Thankfully, the car behind me was far away enough that they were not hit by these glass pieces and also had my interior slider closed. A serious accident could have occurred if both my slider wasn't closed and\/or the car behind me was close to me. I've had the car for less than 3 months, I contacted Honda and advised them of the incident and brought it in to their service department. They claimed to have never heard of anything like this happening before. They have ordered a replacement glass for my sunroof. I'm still waiting for it come in. I also went online and researched sunroofs breaking out of nowhere and did come across many other similar complaints. It seems that it may be happening more frequently with newer vehicles because they are built lighter with thinner metals and thinner glass. The glass used on sunroofs more commonly is tempered glass, not laminated glass. Tempered glass is more prone to shattering when pressure builds up inside the car. When I spoke to Honda corporate and the dealer, neither one could tell me what kind of glass was on the sunroof because they didn't know. I hope this matter can be further looked into. I hope it doesn't happen again. This was a very frightening experience that could have very easily been worse.-Yonkers, NY, USA","1945":"The four doors must receive an usual amount of force for normal closure. We are always leaving a door ajar when we exit. From the inside must pull door with more than usual force. Best to keep hand on door until closed which I have never had to do in a new car and I have purchased numerous new cars over the years. The door feels like dead weight - has almost no closure force. It helps some to open a window or another door to relieve the back pressure but still is not a normal door closure. I have gone to three dealers and nothing they can do since no there is no adjustment. I had a 2009 Pilot and the doors worked just fine. One Honda dealer said the door is likely too heavy for hardware.-Cypress, TX, USA","1946":"Roof rail covers blew off at highway speeds. Poor fit on front roof rail cover moldings leaves air gap. At highway speeds this can cause the 8 foot strips of rubber, pastic moldings to fly off vehicle. This has serious accident potential at highways speeds. Online forums are flooded with similar issues on all trim levels of the 2016 Honda Pilot.-Brooklyn, CT, USA","1947":"Tailgate on my 2016 Honda Pilot fills with water after a couple days of rain. Water runs back into headliner when the tailgate is opened and enters cabin. Water also drips from rubber bumpers when tailgate is open. This is now on record a know problem with Honda, but no solution is available yet. I've been told to call the dealer each month. In the meantime, I can't pack my car on a rainy days or my stuff gets soaked and my car will start to smell from mildew.","1948":"Hood bounces at 60mph and above. Very distracting , unsafe feeling that hood will open and block view. Honda needs a fix for this before it causes a death. Many other owners have reported this unsafe problem.","1949":"While driving 65 mph on the highway a sudden loud bang occurred which sounded exactly like a gunshot going off and glass showered down on my head. Startled, I swerved on the highway, but luckily did not hit any other vehicles. I pulled off the freeway and found that my sunroof had exploded with no outside influence. It was shattered and the glass was blow out in an upward fashion, as if it had happened from the inside of the vehicle. I immediately took the vehicle to the local Honda dealership and they stated that it was not from an outside source. I was given a loaner car and the dealership said they would take care of it, but this happened 9\/23\/2016 and it is yet to be seen if I will need to front any money out of my pocket.-Blaine, WA, USA","1950":"I was going to new York for the holidays with my wife and friend and small dog. My wife has a lot of gifts with boxes rapped up, so I wanted more room in the car, so I decided to buy the original oem side roof rails and of course the cross bars, that came out to about 600.00 dollars. If I would had bought it from Honda dealer it would had been properly over a 1000.00 dollars with installation. AFTER I received the items and installed them I FOUND OUT that I couldn't use my Sears X-cargo on the cross bars because you cannot adjust the cross bars my moving them toward the front or back to line them up with the sears x-cargo brackets. On my previous car 2004 Honda odyssey you where able to adjust the cross bars, you cannot adjust the new cross bars for the 2016 pilot . The other problem is that you cannot strap down anything on the side rails since there is no opening, the side rails are flush down on top of the pilot. So anything you buy and want to tie on four sides is impossible due to the side rails. what do I do?","1951":"I own the 2016 Honda Pilot Touring Edition. I noticed that my back plastic lower bumper panel has a very sharp line molded into the plastic the whole width along the top. This is what you step on when getting up into the cabin. I am seeing this edge break off in several areas from my dog going in and out of the back. My dog must be leaping off the sharp edge and because the material isn't strong on this sharp point, it is cracking off. I took to Honda and they won't cover it. I called Honda Care and the same thing. Honda Caron told me, I was the first complaint. I just don't think I am. I feel that if Honda would have made this edge more of a radius, this would have eliminated the sharp edge on the bumper cover and make this area stronger to wear and tear from going in and out of the back cabin...","1952":"The contact owns a 2016 Honda Pilot.

These headlamps are also not the best on distance objects. I leave the switch in the auto position so I have to turn them on and off sometime to see if they are even on at night or if it is just the daylight running lights that are on. With the vehicle stationary about 8 feet from my garage door the headlamps beam has a sharp cut off for any objects above 33 inches and for any objects below 21 inches.

I called couple days later to make appointment for it and they told me all the headlight cover were like that, nothing they could do and told me don't wait me time to come cause they would not fix it. I called customer service, they gave me case numbers and case manage was named Lorretta. I followed up and left her message but she never called me back until i called her. She said it was like that and nothing she could do. I felt like I have been cheated and frankly if i knew this, i would not buy this car.

As I pulled out of a parking lot, my display panel showed emissions system problem and the engine light came on. Called dealer and they said it's not a big concern unless engine light was flashing and to bring it in after the weekend (was a Friday afternoon). Drove it 30 minutes home at 55-65 mph and noticed no problems. Drove it that distance and speed to take it to the dealer as well with no problems. Picked it up a few days later. Service notes indicate: Code P0328, knock sensor failure, replaced knock sensor and retested, ok at this time. After picking it up, was about 10 min away and trying to go from 60 to 68 and set cruise. Speed began to jump around, not staying at a speed for more than a second 70-60-65-68-63, etc. Engine light now flashing took off cruise and it continued. Turned around to head back to dealer. Car working fine for a bit, but then continued to jerk at different speeds (60, 40, 25). Was stopped at light and engine was still revving at 4 RPM. Stepped off brake and car accelerated on own to 25. Dealer notes: Code P2638, idle relearn, torque management feedback, performed relearn. Today, 6 days after picking it up, I was stopped at a stoplight. Eco button is on, engine idle is running, seat warmer and heater on. While I was still applying brake, the engine idle sounded like it was trying to kick off and the whole car shut off on me. All indicator lights came on, but the engine was off and nothing was running. Turned car off and back on, drove the 2 miles to the dealer, and left it with them.-Blair, NE, USA","1959":"Less than a month after purchasing the car, the cabin lights stopped working. The fuse was replaced, but it happened again. Then the electric in the rear hatch is faulty. At random, when we open the hatch, it will come back down on its own and then it won't work at all for a period of time. This happens with the key fob and also when using the button in the door.

I have posted a video here: Https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?V=btebmywy-is this is very scary because there is nothing you can do to get the car working again - luckily, we have been able to coast to the side of the road. When it first happened, we called Honda emergency roadside assistance and we had a tow on the way when we tried restarting the car several times in a row and that cleared the errors. Since then, we have used the same trick to get the car running again but it has happened twice in the last week - very scary! I have found other similar complaints online so it's clear that there's some kind of computer or electric problem with this model - it's just not obvious what triggers it. We are going to try to trade in our car for a different model because Honda has not been able to provide any help in spite of the fact that we have taken it to the dealer 3 times - I am very disappointed with their service on this.-Glenview, IL, USA","1961":"Car is throwing fault codes for transmission, check engine, electrical.

The hard shifting is causing long term damage to the drive train.-Incline Village, NV, USA","1962":"Two separate incidents in sacramento, ca where we experienced engine failure with our 2016 Honda pilate elite. The first incident occurred in May 2016 on a busy city street with our three young children in the car. While in motion, the car essentially shut down with the display screen showing a series of warnings indicating numerous system failures. There was no engine power but luckily I was able to coast the vehicle to a nearby parking lot. The dealer indicated there was no problem, just a computer glitch, and the only repair necessary was to reset the computer\/software. The second incident occurred last week, only this time while driving on the freeway. We completely lost all engine power but luckily I was in the right lane and I was able to coast to the side and pull over on the shoulder. If I had been in the fast or middle lane with little opportunity to move over, there could have been a serious collision. Similar to the first incident, we were unable to start the car with the warning lights showing various system failures. We had the car towed to the same dealer who initially indicated they would just reboot the software again. So we pressed upon them to do a more thorough diagnosis since this is the second time its happened. They agreed to keep the vehicle and seek to identify the root cause of the problem. At this point no diagnosis has been made. We would have never expected this from a near brand new (purchased in December 2015 and currently has only 9,200 miles) Pilot elite loaded with safety and technology features. Again we experienced two separate incidents where the car immediately shut down while in motion with the most recent occurring on the freeway.

The car basically started to shut down. Since we were in the far right lane, my wife was able to coast over to the shoulder. If we had been traveling in the middle or left lane of traffic, there would have been little if any chance of moving over to the curb.

Yesterday I was going to make a left hand turn at a 4 way stop and the engine surged and I had to go straight to avoid hitting a car. The dealer checked breaks and gas peddle and found no problems. The touch screen radio controls sometimes does not work. Dealer mechanic said computer controls that and car gas too, therefore I think it is a software issue that needs to be addressed immediately. I have a code number with America Honda. They are checking into the matter and hope they find a solution before I wreck or worst kill someone. I have had this new vehicle about 6 weeks. Only 1300 miles on it.-Frankfort, KY, USA","1983":"I have the Honda AWD 2016 touring model with Z transmission. Since purchase, the vehicle will acceralte by itself when driving down the slope between 25 -30 miles per hour, the break will not stop the speeding, and actually will reduce the speed and it appears transmission will force the speed goes up against the break. During the drive, at this range, when accelarate, the vehicle will make a squik sound by the tire level, almost feel the tire is trying to catch up with the speed of transmission and won't turn as fast as it could and hence the squik sound, the vehicle is about 24 K miles and very challenging in driving this car. Need this to be replaced as the Z transmission recall is starting by other manufactures.. the worst is the speed of the car at drive down slope and could kill anyone due to it actually automatically start speeding even though my foot is on brake.-Cary, NC, USA","1984":"I was driving in the rain at about 30 miles and hour towards a red light. I began to slow down with the brakes, but the car would not stop and skidded right through the red light. I also tried steering the car to the right, but the car would not steer right and kept skidding through the red light until it slightly hit the median and stopped. Luckily, no oncoming cars were coming or my car would have went right into them. The tires claim to be \"all weather tires\" which are Bridgestone dueler tires, 245\/60R18. On other occasions in the rain, I have felt the car skid when tapping on the breaks while turning, but not to the extent of yesterday when I could have been in a terrible accident. I also read on line of another person reporting skidding while turning in the rain in a Honda Pilot. Something happens with this car in the rain that causes the brakes to not stop the car and instead skid as if it is on ice without control of the steering at the same time.-Adamstown, MD, USA","1985":"Since purchasing new, I have noticed a peculiar phenomenon whereby the brake pedal develops a very high resistance from the time of being parked, until the next time I get in the vehicle. I will routinely depress the brake pedal to place the vehicle in park at the conclusion of a drive. The pedal feels normal at this point. Approximately 80-85% of the time upon re-entry in to the vehicle after allowing the vehicle to sit stationary (off) for 2-12 hours, the brake pedal becomes very firm. To the point where I feel uncomfortable with the amount of force I must press with my foot, in order to the engine to start. I don't want to over-pressure the brake lines unnecessarily. However, most of the time, if I simply press the brake with an average amount of force to start the car, I press the \"start\" button, and the system will only turn on to aux mode, the engine starter will not activate. Due to the highly firm pedal, my \"acceptable\" level of foot force will not sufficiently displace the brake pedal to enable \"engine start\" ready mode. I am perplexed by this odd behavior. I have never experienced this in any other vehicle I have owned in my 17 years of driving experience. I would really like to know how the brake system becomes \"loaded\" if it is just sitting. This is the sort of result I might expect if one were to \"pump\" the brakes without the engine running, but I am doing nothing of the sort. Please Honda, address this. I really have to wonder if other 2016 and newer Pilot and ridgeline owners are experiencing this.-Richboro, PA, USA","1986":"Collision mitigation braking system (cmbs) does not work in stage 2 or stage 3. only the warning light comes on. Brakes are never applied. Going more than 10 mph faster than the car ahead of you, only stage 1 comes on with a warning notice. No light braking for stage 2. no hard braking for stage 3. I am emergency vehicle operator course trained. I had someone who I know keep a constant speed of 30 mph and then retested again going 50 mph. I would approach going 10 mph faster than the lead car and only stage 1 warning would activate, even when I was only 10 feet away before I had to manually apply the brakes hard. Apparently Honda\/accura had an earlier issue with the cmbs falsely activating due to being too sensitive. They did a software update but now it is not activating stage 2 or stage 3. this occurs no matter what setting ( long, normal, short) you have the cmbs set to. I brought it in twice to the dealer and although the service tech test drove it and couldn't get the brakes to work the computer stated everything was fine. Honda tech line was also called by the dealer and they said if the computer said there was no errors there is nothing to do. I called Honda corporation and they also said there was nothing that could be done. Automatic cruise control works so it can't be the radar or camera.

About 9 months into owning the car, I noticed when travelling down hill that when I applied brakes my car started to shake. The rotors were too hot and so the dealership shaved them for free. It happened again only 3 months later with barely any miles driven. The dealership claims it is normal wear and tear and its because its a heavy car. However, I have driven SUVs before and this has never been a problem. The tech even admitted to me that he thinks they should upgrade the brakes. Clearly this is a recurring problem with several customer complaints. It is scary and unsafe, and Honda should be held accountable for this mechanical issue. I was told by the tech that in the future I will have to pay for a poorly designed brake system. I spent over 40K on this car and I should not be having this type of braking issues. It is truly a safety problem.","1992":"At 5,000 km the front brake disk needed skimming since there where \"burnt spots\" that caused the steering to vibrate when applying the brakes. The dealership claimed that I was over braking and must have made an emergency brake. I never had this problem before on big cars.At 25000 km the dealer said there where scratches on the disks and due to them being to thin it needed to be replaced. At 25000km? Also the front brake pads wear at double the speed as the back and needs to be replaced at only 25000km. Clearly there is design issues here, and as no warranty applies to wear and tear - I will have to foot the bill to a poorly designed breaking system.I will need to get rid of this vehicle asap. I can't advise anyone out there to purchase a Pilot.

Assuming that may be they forget to fill up the brake fluid up to full, but seriously was confused on the other hand. What could happen with a new car driven less than 50kms? Anyway, the happiness of buying the new car was spoiling, so I thought I will check with the showroom tomorrow morning .In the morning headed towards the showroom.  The moment I reached near financial center, the brakes which were already spongy, now even on full pedal were responding even less. I was afraid of an accident so put the hazard light on. I showed them the car and they confirmed that there is almost no brake fluid. The technician put some brake fluid in order to take the car in the Service area.They gave courtesy car and told me to go to work and will update me. In the afternoon I went to the Service center and found the technician dealing with other IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDING BEST CUSTOMER SERVICES. He told me there is leakage.

I backed out fine and started to pull back into the driveway. I did not use the accelerator since I just wanted the car to ease into the driveway as I applied the brakes. The car failed to stop. I pushed hard on the brakes as we neared my friends car and it finally stopped when I hit his car and put the car in PARK. My car pushed his Toyota Avalon several feet and almost into his garage wall. I then put my car in REVERSE and the same thing happened. I could not stop the car. Immediately behind my car was another driveway with a couple of trucks. I turned the wheel to avoid the cars but hit his mailbox and broke my tail light and made a large scrape the full left side of my car including my left side mirror which was turned. Once again only PARK stopped this vehicle. The guy who lived across the street saw and heard this while he was standing in the yard drinking some coffee and getting ready to go to work.. He told me he heard a clicking sound as I backed up and tried to stop the car with the brake. I do not remember if I heard it or not since I was concentrating on trying to stop the Pilot.I called a Honda dealer and told him I was bringing it in and a little bit about the accident. I called for a tow truck since I was not going to drive it. The tow truck driver said he thought there was something wrong with the car as he backed it out of the garage. He used the emergency brake to put it on the street and stop it. He then pulled it on his carriage with his chain hoist and dropped it off at the Honda dealer.My friend and I went to the dealer to talk to service person. He said he would check it out. When I told him what the tow truck driver said, he replied that \" he is just a tow truck driver\".The Honda dealership had the car until late Tueaday afternoon, 1.5 days. They could not find anything wrong with the brakes and ran it through diagnostics and found a code for an AC problem. The area service rep was there on Tuesday afternoon and drove the car and reviewed what had been done. She said the car was safe to drive. The service tech told me the same thing that the car was safe to drive.I did drive it home from Myrtle Beach to Raleigh and then back to Chantilly, Virginia. I have not had any other problems but I am very careful as I apply the brakes and especially as I approach a red light or any stop.Honda says there is nothing wrong but they only react to their tests.","1995":"Whenever the A\/C is on, the speakers will pop every 3-5 minutes. This happens independent of stereo operation. Research on the topic shows this is an old problem from the prior generation Pilot, and also exists on Acura TLX. Based on solutions found by forum members, the root cause is an under-engineered circuit for the A\/C compressor clutch solenoid. Whenever the solenoid (de)activates the A\/C compressor, a spike is emitted through the electrical system. When the vehicle is new, the clutch relays absorb the shock. As the relays wear, they can no longer absorb the electrical shock so the interference is heard through the stereo. Simply replacing relays is a stop-gap measure. The relays will continue to see the spikes and eventually they are ineffective from filtering the spikes. In my video below, the vehicle is only seven months old.","1996":"First time we drove the brand new car home we started hearing a loud clicking noise coming from the hood, we thought maybe something was left in there and they trying to harm us or punish us, given all the headaches, lies and frustration we went through before buying the car { the General manager had to get involve! } Anyways, took the car back and they found that something about the air condition was off!

Funny thing though, when I said the oil change was a month ago, the towel theory was tossed out (of course if they bothered to look at the sticker the other dealer put in the window, they would have seen the date).Some Honda Rep is supposed to be at the dealer tomorrow to tell me how, and yes, this is a direct quote, \"Honda will take care of it all\".I really like my Pilot.

I was driving my car in the normal mode (acc and lkas disabled) on a normal two lane paved road when the car in front of me made a slow right turn. I was not following very closely and came to a complete stop on my own to avoid running into the other car. I stopped about 15 feet away from the other car. The other car then completed the turn to the extent that the other car was no longer in the way of me driving forward in a straight line. When I pushed the gas to then proceed the collision mitigation system started flashing the \"brake\" message and producing an audible warning. At this point I was possibly going 10 mph again. After verifying that there was definitely not anything in my way, I kept applying the gas. My car then started braking on its own, at which point I pushed the gas harder to presumably over-ride the braking. A moment or two later, my car then made a sudden and hard brake on its own that brought my car to a complete stop, despite the fact that I was pushing hard on the gas. The other car that had turned was well clear of the lane by this point, and was easily 1 ft away from my path of travel when I started accelerating in the first place. My only explanation is that the collision mitigation system was confused by the lack of a shoulder lane marker (only a raise cement curb was present) and somehow thought the car was still in the \"road.\" In either case, the system malfunctioned to the point that my car was suddenly brought to a complete stop, and the car behind me very nearly rear-ended me in a situation where I had already come to a stop, and the obstacle in front of me had cleared \/ continued to become increasingly more clear of my path.

Collision mitigation: - all of these trigger \"brake\" messages to be displayed, which is just 1 step before the brakes being auto-applied, which could cause me to be rear-ended. - false alarms while merging from lefthand onramps where a pending collision with the jersey barrier is detected - false alarms by the hills adjacent to the road when going around a sharp turn on back roads - false alarms when cresting a hill with a curve after the hill and it thinks an oncoming car will be hit, because it can't see the lane markings past the hill lane keep assist: - partially goes into exit ramps on its own if in the right lane, causing other drivers to think I am leaving the lane and start to merge themselves - is confused by lines of tar and will depart the lane on its own - often \"fights\" with the lane departure mitigation around corners - tries to prevent me from giving other vehicles some buffer when passing them, if they are wider or drifting toward me. - does not alert when it stops being able to detect the lines-Gaithersburg, MD, USA","2005":"Vehicle loss acceleration while traveling at 65 mph (engine still running) speed slowed to 25-30 mph then returns to full control.

There was no engine power but luckily I was able to coast the vehicle to a nearby parking lot. The dealer indicated there was no problem, just a computer glitch, and the only repair necessary was to reset the computer\/software. The second incident occurred last week, only this time while driving on the freeway. We completely lost all engine power but luckily I was in the right lane and I was able to coast to the side and pull over on the shoulder. If I had been in the fast or middle lane with little opportunity to move over, there could have been a serious collision. Similar to the first incident, we were unable to start the car with the warning lights showing various system failures. We had the car towed to the same dealer who initially indicated they would just reboot the software again. So we pressed upon them to do a more thorough diagnosis since this is the second time its happened. They agreed to keep the vehicle and seek to identify the root cause of the problem.

When I got the Pilot back I parked it in my garage. I did an errand and parked it back in my garage. Later, I discovered two oil spots, one large and one small in my garage. I called San Tan Honda and they scheduled an appointment the very next day. They said it is residual oil that landed on the sub frame during the oil change and that the oil filter was intact. The service adviser told me the mechanic cleaned the sub frame of the residual oil. I brought the pilot back home, parked it in my driveway so I could clean the oil spots in my garage. When I moved the pilot back in the garage, I discovered oil spots in my driveway (post cleaning by the mechanic). I called that in to San Tan Honda and they were kind enough to offer to send a cleaning unit to clean my driveway....I told them I already clean the oil stain. Kudos to San Tan Honda (Auto Nation Honda Chandler) for going over and beyond in customer service.Here's the problem, the engineers placed the oil filter right above the right front sub frame of the 2016 Pilot. There's no room to put a the drip pan to catch the oil that leads into the barrel. If the oil filter tilts a little upon removal or falls over you can have up to a 1\/2 cup of oil spill unto the sub frame. No amount of cleaning short of steam cleaning the sub frame will removed the spilled oil. I hand only one oil changed and already my sub frame on the right front is greased up due to the spilled oil.There's four solutions:\nl) after an oil changed, parked your 2016 Honda on the street for a month or buy a large drip pan for your garage.\n2) Have Honda engineers redesigned the engine so there's nothing directly under the oil filter so that the mechanic can placed the drip pan directly under the filter to catch the old filter and any residual oil.\n3) Come up with a policy\/procedures for the Honda mechanics to follow to redirect the residual oil into the drip pan....such as: have a piece of sheet metal (12\" by 18\") with a center crease placed under the oil filter that is about to be removed, with the lower end of the sheet metal placed above the drip pan. That way the oil filter and any residual oil would still drip into the drip pan and not the the sub frame. \n4) Do your oil change yourself and put more care about channeling the residual oil into a drip pan then the mechanic....keeping the sub frame from getting all greased up.Let me make a note that Auto Nation Honda Chandler was very accommodating and this design flaw is by no way reflect on their ability to remedy the situation.","2017":"We just brought this vehicle home after waiting 3 months to have it built and delivered. At less than 100 miles, SOMETIMES when shifting from Drive to Park the engine will try to restart, even though it is already running.

Basically, the car dies - it loses all power and every warning light you can imagine starts to go off. If you give it gas, the car starts to shake like it has a major transmission problem. This has happened twice on the highway and once in busy traffic - luckily, we have been able to get to the side of the road.The first time this happened, we called for a tow but we were able to \"reboot\" the car by starting and stopping it over and over again. Since then, we have used that trick to get the car working again but it is very scary and dangerous to have your car just stop working in the middle highway. I have seen a few similar complaints on this forum but it's unclear whether anyone has gotten help from Honda to get this issue fixed. It seems like a software problem of some kind but it's unclear what triggers it because it has happened in three different circumstances.","2019":"It took a total of 4 different trips to the dealer to attempt to fix the check engine light.1st trip - dealer just reset light and said try that.2nd trip - 4 days later check engine light came in again, they check intake manifold gasket, it was ok, reset light and on my way. Dealer had car for 2 days.3rd trip - 7 days later check engine light came in again, this time oxygen sensor replaced and sent on my way.

I just want this issue fixed once and for all.","2024":"Well, I decided to purchase a new 2016 Honda Touring Pilot from a local dealer. I have been reading an awful lot of complaints on this new vehicle from Piloteers.org. I have to say that I am not experiencing all the same complaints, however, at this point, only one. My Auto Idle Stop feature does not work or it works intermittently. Jury is still out on that issue. I received the SUV with 12 miles on her. I started to realize soon after that my Auto Stop Idle was not working. It did work a few times, etc... This was probably around 250 miles. I took Suv to dealer at 333 miles on her, where they sat me down and explained that a lot of certain conditions need to be met for it to work. I replied,that I read the manual and CD. I met all those requirements. \"It still does not work.\" Actually, I just looked at what the service tech wrote in her comments and don't agree at all. She wrote \"C\/S Stop Idle is Inop. Please advise. Customer spoke with Scott-will leave his last name omitted and went over stop Idle operation. No corrective action to be made. Working as described.\" How can she say, it is working as described? Scott indicated that he didn't know why it isn't working. He went on to tell me that unless the icon flashes and throws a code, they can't do anything. I understand that logic, however, it isn't working and it isn't throwing any codes to the computer. What do I have to do to get this to work? It should work every time I have the system on and ready. Seat belt on, defroster off, all engine temps normal because of driving the SUV, system on and ready, no flashing icon. What do they want, screaming kids in the back seat bouncing all around to get this system to work? Bottom line is that it does not work and I somewhat felt blown off at my dealer. I realize that the SUV is brand new. I don't know what to do. I paid over 46k and feel all advertised systems should work 100% of the time. Thank you.Update from Nov 7, 2015:This is an update to my original issue with the Auto Idle Stop. After I wrote the complaint the other morning, you will never guess what happen to work the next day? Yup the Auto Idle Stop. I had exactly 415 miles on vehicle. The only thing I did that was different was a few days prior I went in to the settings on my 8\" screen. Vehicle-meter, turn on and off the Auto Idle Stop. I turned it on and off a few times, so you could see it on the MID. Has nothing to do with the manual button you press on the center shifter. I leave that on all the time. Besides it defaults to on every time the car is started. It was raining out and for a second I thought that maybe, I am experiencing a condensation issue with the system. I don't know... I plan on monitoring this. I realize that certain conditions need to be met for it to operate. I meet all the conditions everyday I drive the vehicle. You turn it on, it should operate, you shut off, it doesn't. I think it is possibly a software related problem. I recently was made aware from these great web sites that a recall is under way for a \"software update odometer issue\" on the Pilot. I wonder if this is somehow related as well? Jury is out on that one too. Will keep the site posted.. All I know now is that it works..................... If anyone else is experiencing these issues please report it here and on Piloteers.org. Honda sure as hell isn't going to call us and say. Hey we screwed up on the Pilot. They will only do this if they have too.

I was not told of this replacement and was not given the option to purchase or not. I wrote to Honda expecting some compensation or extension of the warranty. All I got was phone calls saying it was between the dealer and me. Honda Motor Company was totally unwilling to address the issue at all, leaving me with a situation where I have no idea when the system will malfunction again or what will be done to fix it.

The Honda dealership recognized the transmission issue but was unable to come up with a clear diagnosis. The problem appeared to reset itself after leaving the vehicle off and parked for several hours. At 69K, once the powertrain warranty expired (60K miles), the transmission failed again. The Honda dealership service department once again recognized the transmission issue but did not have a clear diagnosis. After adding software updates and adding transmission fluid the problem failed to resolve. The Honda Dealership Service department consulted with Honda Corporate at which time it was determined the transmission needed to be replaced at a cost of $6200. After over 1 1\/2 weeks of deliberating, Honda would not agree to pay for the entire amount holding us responsible for $750. We followed the service recommendations that were displayed on our display panel. We have been out of a vehicle for 2 1\/2 weeks by the time our vehicle has been repaired, had to rent a vehicle upon initial transmission failure at 53K miles and have spent hours dealing with customer service at Honda Corporate that was uncharacteristically rude for a reputable company like Honda. Since our transmission problem, we have noted this to be a common complaint among Honda Pilot owners. We have more miles on our 2016 Honda Pilot Elite(69K) than most people with similar aged vehicles....Honda Pilot owners with the 9 speed transmission beware of this problem as it can certainly be a safety hazard when the transmission goes out on the highway.

You have to be fully alert all the time and not look away too long or the car will wander .Update from Dec 31, 2016:I've had the steering reprogramed to show that it has 19 inch wheels instead of 17 inch which seems to solve the problem.

Once i pulled off the car stopped altogether, i couldn't get it to turn over. I had to be towed to a dealership in San Antonio TX about 2 hours from my home in Austin TX. The dealership kept it about a week before they reported that my engine had seized and all i can do is replace the engine. The warranty refused to cover, they insisted it was due to not maintaining the oil changes. I provided a few copies of oil changes that i done the most recent in November. My car was not due for another oil change until February. They reported that there was little oil in the vehicle and sludge. My car is only 2yrs old everyone I've spoken to has said that even if i didn't change the oil the vehicle is so new it shouldn't have caused that kind of damage. I did maintain my vehicle with regular oil changes because i didn't do it at Hyundai they are refusing to cover the cost. The dealership itself has been horrendous to deal with, not returning my calls, when i asked to speak with the GM they said they didn't have one and refused to give me any contact information. The service manager told me there were metal shavings in my engine and then back tracked and said oh wait i deal with a lot of cars maybe it wasn't yours, let me check. She has yet to respond to that question and refused to send me pictures or documentation of what's wrong or a written estimate to fix it.

To make a long story short, after numerous calls and service appointments I discovered that I don't get any cell coverage on my driveway. The problem is only my driveway and approximately 1\/2 mile radius. When I call in to BlueLink all I get is a statement that cell coverage can be spotty and Hyundai has no control over cell. I find this very offensive as the service used to work fine so either Hyundai changed carriers or the local cell tower has a problem. Trying to get someone in BlueLink to look into why the service has stopped working is an impossibility. I'm sure someone in Hyundai knows who the carrier is and can refer the problem for repair. Why do they treat their customer's like morons?","2078":"We bought the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe AWD 2.OT with it totally loaded. I invited on the cooling seats, which added a considerable amount to the car with that package. Anyhow, when we purchased the vehicle, the cooling seats worked well. You could feel the air blow in the seat cushion and in the back of the seat. Very comfortable. It actually got too cold at times, but you could definitely feel the air flowing.Now, we can't feel a thing. The drivers side seat you can't feel anything coming from it. The back of the seat you can feel it get cold. The passenger's seat you can hardly feel anything unless the car has been running for close to 30 minutes. We took it into the dealership (now two different times) and they don't see anything wrong with it. We have gotten customer support involved and they will not do anything further to help with getting the seats back to the way they were when we purchased the car.I'm so frustrated. I bought the car because of high customer satisfaction and of course the ventilated seats sealed the deal for me.

As soon as I realized it I took the car to my local Hyundai dealer in Virginia Beach VA. I got completely stone walled and they said AM was hard to get in this area (not true), so I took it to the Hyundai dealer in Chesapeake VA and they said it was the radio and it needed to be replaced at a cost of $1400. Both dealers encouraged me to subscribe to Sirius radio as the previous owners had done. I have been taking portable radio with me in the car to get AM. I tell everybody why.I want AM radio to get local news and I feel like this is a defect in the car and Hyundai should come clean about it. I get no help from the local dealers.

They said no one listens to AM radio anyway. Tell that to my wife.Other than that the car is incredible in every respect ... especially the turbo engine.Update from Mar 16, 2017:Problem was resolved after a total time of 3 months. Turns out the antenna was NOT the problem... it was the main\nantenna wire connector loose\/damaged in the vicinity of the front windshield. Replacing this cable allowed the car to\nreceive AM stations although poorly. The Hyundai only got 10 stations where my Honda CRV and Toyota pickup\nboth received more than 20 stations Why was their initial diagnosis so flawed ? (Poor troubleshooting) They even\nlied once & suggested they fixed the problem when they did NOT. I did see an AD in the newspaper afterwards for\na master mechanic at the dealership in question. I also saw articles on the net that Hyundai AM radio reception,\nin general, was substandard with the rest of industry.

No visible engine light or fault code was triggered. Less severe problem: On a regular basis, the vehicle suffers abrupt and sustained loss of power in merging situations (especially when turning on city streets from a stop).

Now, the system is supposed to activate when it senses a vehicle IN FRONT OF it so that it can maintain a safe distance behind it. However, this happened when a person was jogging on the sidewalk next to me (and I promise that I was not driving on the sidewalk at this poor person), when a bus next to me slowed around a corner, and when two vehicles turned right in the right turn lane while I progressed in the right straight lane. I was almost rear ended on two of these occasions because of how abrupt the braking is. Moreover, when an animal ran out in front of me, the system did not activate and I nearly collided with it. It renders the system not only completely useless, but a huge danger and liability. When I took it to the dealership, they told me \"this is normal\" and that the system is \"too sophisticated for its own good\". I want people to understand that the party line has been that these vehicles are operating as intended, so that really makes me questions what these engineers intended and why these engineers are still being allowed to create these inferior-performing vehicles.","2128":"Pulled into parking space in a parking lot very slowly.

Mainly notice it when taking a corner. It seems as if it has trouble selecting the gear and once it does, it lurches forward.

Also, my traction control light will come on around certain corners and leaves me without control of the car. Also another safety issue as again the car hesitates or locks up because of this feature and doesn't allow me to drive forward as I wish. It's the middle of the summer without any rain and definitely no snow on the ground (I'd say perfect road conditions) so no real reason why my traction control should be turning on around corners. Very concerned about this issue! also, I should note that these issues have been happening long before 1600 miles. I noticed them the first week or so that I took the vehicle home so definitely less than 500 miles as I bought it new.

Obviously Hyundai will not recall this issue until many deaths are reported as a result of loss of acceleration. Shame on you Hyundai !!!!","2142":"Purchased the car new from the dealer. The engine and safety issues can make this car somewhat dangerous to drive.ISSUES:\n- From a complete stop and then turning right uphill, the car stalls\/hesitates during acceleration, can come to a complete stop and can even start rolling backwards during acceleration uphill. Specifically, when turning right and accelerating uphill, the traction control switches on automatically, which can cause a complete loss of torque and also pushes RPM's to well over 6000 while the car is attempting to shift from first to second gear. This creates a dangerous stall situation and also causes the steering and handling to become unpredictable. This could lead to a potentially dangerous safety condition of the car rolling back into another car or over-steering into traffic\/curb.- The \"Eco Mode\" is dangerous. The steering is much too loose during this mode and can lead to over-steering while driving at higher speeds. I've tested this mode extensively and there also appears to be absolutely no fuel savings between it and the standard driving mode. This mode can also cause a complete loss of torque\/acceleration and creates a stall\/hesitation during acceleration from a stop while trying to enter and merge onto freeways. Avoid ever using this mode as it is definitely not worth the risk and is not saving much if any fuel. The Hyundai manual claims the car has \"260 ft lbs of torque\", but this may be an inaccurate claim.- Did not realize that the collision avoidance systems and automatic braking are not standard on the premium trim package for the Ultimate. They are only standard the \"Ultimate Tech Package\". These features are prominently displayed on the Hyundai USA website, but are not featured with the premium package. These safety systems are going to be standard on all new vehicles starting in 2022. Why they did not include these as standard safety features with their premium package is beyond me. Hyundai also indicates that they do not offer a standard safety features upgrade with the premium package, as it is only sold with the \"Ultimate Tech Package\".POSSIBLE SOLUTION?\n- One solution may be to reprogram the computer, so when the car is started, the default is \"Sport\" mode with traction control turned off. Also, the gear ratio from first to second gear is too high\/wide and needs to be set to start shifting at around 4-5000 RPMs from a stop during acceleration (as it should not be going over 6000 RPMs while attempting to shift from 1st to 2nd gear).CONCLUSION\nOverall, I really like the premium features this car offers (panoramic sunroof, push-button start, auto lift-gate, overall driving comfort, etc.), however I'm very disappointed and concerned with this car overall and I feel that Hyundai has not been very receptive to my concerns. I'm taking it to back to the dealer to see if any of these issues can be worked out. A $40k car should not have these issues and I'm also frustrated at the lack of standard safety features, and that this was not disclosed during purchase.","2143":"refueling cuts off prior to full tankWhen filling tank, pump clicks off prior to being full.

This is another safety issue. Additionally the lights of the trailer constantly run even when the power is completely off. Lastly the harness where the trailers electrical plugs into on the vehicle, pops out of place when plugging it in. In turn causing me to reseat the vehicles harness each time. I want out of this vehicle but they will not offer me a buy back. I plan to contact a lemon law attorney as I am unable to receive help otherwise.-Charles Town, WV, USA","2162":"When accelerating after slowing down to either make a left or right turn car loses power to the engine. It appears that the car is hesitating to accelerate and can be very dangerous when entering the highway. This can be very fatal especially for drivers unaware of this issue. If it presents itself at the wrong time can lead to a very serious accidents with potential fatalities. This has happened since the car was purchased in May 2016 currently car has over 1600 miles (3 months owned). Potential re-flashing of automotive computer is required. Could be part of the traction control system and the cars roll over sensors which can be contributing. Hyundai has to research this before someone gets injured.-Flushing, NY, USA","2163":"The contact owns a 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe. While attempting to accelerate, the vehicle stalled without warning.

It struggles to get up to speed, which causes daily (yes, daily) close calls. And the engine redlines during these struggles no matter what mode (normal, eco, sport) the vehicle is in.

Traction control light comes one (roads dry) and car does not respond to gas pedal. +++dangerous as car has serious lack of acceleration which could cause accident.(Happens only when cold). Also find that the slow-down-then-accelerate problem reported by others I have seen as well. +++ dangerous in pulling out into traffic. I had 2012 Santa Fe for 5+ years prior to buying the 2017 and now this vehicle worries me. I am a professional performance driver (paramedic), and I drive a wide variety of vehicles in a wide range of conditions as well as having a vintage Porsche super car. The new 2017 Santa Fe has something wrong with its transmission control system.Update from Apr 16, 2017:Think I may have a handle on the lack of acceleration problem.  It appears that when accelerating from stop, if you drive through a pot hole (it's Spring in Canada so not too hard to find one) the tiny bit of wheel spin triggers the traction control system.  This in turn takes 4-6 seconds to decide to turn itself off.  While doing this, you have very little acceleration capability.  Its quite dangerous in my opinion as you might be pulling into traffic.  I tested this theory at my favourite pot hole outside of work by disengaging the traction control and viola! No problem.  Seems like the traction control is too sensitive, confusing pot holes for slippery roads.","2168":"powertrain issue\/acceleration problembrand new santa fe sport 2017 hesitates badly when coming out of turns and attempting to accelerate, just short of coming to a stop. It is very pronounced and happens intermittently. I can not duplicate it on demand, but it is dangerous especially in the face of on coming traffic when it happens. Saw a service person at Hyundai and they said there is nothing they can do and brushed it off.","2169":"vehicle swerves or sways left and rightI bought a brand new Santa Fe Sport 2.4 on Tue, Mar 15. I drove the car home, about 5 minutes from the dealership. All seemed well. The next day, I went on a road trip from Kennesaw to Savannah, GA, which is about 300 miles. The car drove mostly okay. While driving 55+ on the highway, I noticed constantly having to correct the steering wheel as the car wanted to veer left or right. It wasn't horrible just yet. I arrived late night in Savannah, very excited about my new car. It was a fun drive aside from the odd steering that wouldn't stay straight. I parked the car at my mother's house (who lives in Savannah). Savannah is a walking town, so NO need for the car while I was there. I did not drive the car again until Sunday, March 20, when I returned to Atlanta. The first 20 minutes of the trip was about like the drive down from Atlanta. I had to keep the steering wheel in check. VERY ANNOYING. But soon, it started feeling worse, more drastic pulling. I felt like the wind was blowing me around, but it wasn't that at all. Tire pressure was about the same as it was coming down. I checked that several times. I did notice driving down it was 51 psi. Then when I started the trip back, I saw 48psi save one tired at 49psi. Odd. Then 15-20 minutes later into the trip, it was back up to 50 psi on all 4 tires. Odd. Either way, I stayed around 60-65 mph speed limit because the swerving was getting scary. I did about 75-80 on the trip down to Savannah, and about that starting back until the swaying\/swerving got worse. I had my 8 month old baby daughter in the car, so I was stressed the entire 5 hour trip back home, paranoid I would lose control. I was emotionally drained when I got home. I was distraught and depressed after realizing I just bought a gigantic LEMON! And I hardly expect the dealership to do a thing! This has all just happened, so we will see how HYUNDAI OF KENNESAW decides to HANDLE this one. I will go in person later today to see if they will do anything to make this right.Update from Mar 30, 2016:The dealership has been working with me beatifully on this. Too bad the Hyundai brand steering is so strange. The swerving issue has not recurred; but the car cannot maintain a straight line without constant correction of the wheel. I am getting used to it now; but I would not choose this car or Hyundai brand again. My dealership, though, restored my faith in good business ethics for now. Though they did lose a set of my new car keys. But they are going to replace them.","2170":"We bought our 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport used; it had only 11,000 miles on it. Driving home from the dealership, I noticed the steering wheel would shudder and vibrate as the wheel returned to center after a turn. It does not do this all the time, but it suggests there is an issue with the steering column or worse; the steering rack. If there is slipping going on in the steering column or rack, it could be dangerous, as the vehicle could have difficulty steering, or lose the ability completely when in Drive. Hyundai should figure out what is causing this shudder, and issue a TSB along with a recall to address this complaint which a lot of consumers are reporting.","2171":"Driving away from the dealership, after purchasing a 2017 Santa Fe Sport AWD, 2.4 litre, I was pulling out of the entrance and the steering wheel shuddered. Assuming there was a bump or possible grating (due to ice on the roads) I kept driving. When I reached my home, approximately 3 km's away, it shuddered again as I was pulling into my driveway. If it hadn't been Saturday afternoon, I would have brought it back immediately but I still thought it was because it was slippery outside. That was last Saturday. It is now one week and 3 days later and it still shudders, no more ice outside, but it does it over bumps as well, so I will be bringing it back to the dealership to see what they have to say about it.It does not leave a confident feeling when you're driving and your steering starts to shudder for no reason. It almost feels as if the ball joints are so tight and hard as rock that the slightest bump could be causing the shudder.Purchased February 22 and picked up on Saturday, February 25th, 2017.","2172":"As I come out of a turn and am letting the wheel return to straight position, and giving it some gas,, the steering wheel shuddered. Not with every turn. Felt it more on gravel roads. I have never had a new car do this. after doing an alignment was done, it was decided to try doing a front end alignment, then replacing the steering column (3 times!). None of these changed it. so they found another car same kind and make for me to test drive, and it did the same thing. So they are saying all the sport models do it. But that does not make it right. It only does it about 3-4 times a day.but the dealership says it nothing. I still have a problem and want to use the lemon law.Update from Oct 16, 2016:Wording of original complaint above is not quite right--The 1st time I took it in for service for this complaint, I was told it was normal. 2nd time, they did an alignment, which was no help. The on 3 separate occasions, a new steering column was installed. Then they got the manager of the service  dept to get involved, and he actually found the same vehicle a Santa Fe SPORT model, and when i drove it, the steering wheel shuddered coming out of a turn just like mine did.  So he surmised that all 2017 Santa Fe Sports so this, so it is ok.  I am not so sure of this, however. No other car I ever drove has done this steering wheel shudder when coming out of a turn.","2173":"In the affected vehicle, the wires in the can wiring harness assembly and airbag wiring harness assembly may be damaged by the passenger seat's height adjuster mechanism. A metal 3rd party power inverter was positioned underneath the passenger seat. Prior seat adjustments caused the sheath around the harnesses to become bare, exposing the electrical wiring. The metal power inverter become lodged against the wiring causing a short in the wiring and causing the entire vehicle's electrical system to fail. The epb (electronic parking break) became engaged and it was impossible to drive the vehicle. Although acknowledge that the 3rd party power inverter was under the seat, the vehicle had been driven 4 times with it under it, totaling less than 800 miles. It is not known how long it would take for that box to rub against the sheath on the harness and bare the wiring, therefore it is suspected that the power seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare and that recall #141 safety campaign #16V145000 may not have been properly resolved. We believe the seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare, prior to the inverter being placed under the seat. The inverter was positioned such that it wasn't making contact with the bare wire, until the seat was adjusted on 7\/2\/2017. The car was not driven on 7\/3\/2016. The incident occurred on 7\/4\/216 as the vehicle was driven across railroad tracks. It is believed the inverter was then jarred against the bare wire, causing the short. The dealership has not validated this; they are suggesting it was the inverter that caused the wires to become bare. Our opinion is that the inverter was not there long enough to cause that wiring to become bare. It wasn't until I discovered this previous recall that everything started to make sense. It is a $5,300 repair because the other wires involved that are bare are for the airbags.-Phoenix, AZ, USA","2174":"Have been to dealer twice.......keeps happening; screen is off and on all the time!!

First time I used the GPS navigation in this car I just wanted to try it out and see how it does. It would have taken me 20 minutes to get to a location 10 minutes away. I tried changing settings in it and try it again. Still very scenic. I then tried it going over the border to Road to the Sun in Montana. It wanted me to take a 150 km detour to get there. Thank goodness I didn't get rid of our old Garmin GPS. I will trust that one any day of the week over this unit in the car. Also being a brand new car and old maps in it? Roads that were built 3 years ago still not on the maps in the car? Find it strange they would try to sell this as a feature.","2177":"This first occurred within the first week of owning this vehicle. The first time it happened, the entire infotainment system turned off and would not turn back on until I restarted the car. Over the next several months, Pandora would not properly load and I would have to use my actual phone to play music rather than the interface built to do so for me (another safety issue). Twice, when directing the infotainment system to make calls, it would not comply and would idle (the microphone was perfectly operational, as the phone calls I made prior and after this situation were in perfect working order...again, toggled via my phone and not the infotainment system built to accommodate this function. These issues refused to clear until the vehicle was restarted. However, the issue with Pandora happened on almost a daily basis.","2178":"something locks up in transmission or drivetrainWhile traveling on the interstate at approx 65\/70 miles per hour, it felt as if I had hit a horse in the road way!My friend riding with me, was looking at her phone at the time, her purse was thrown from the seat against the dash, and she wanted to know what I hit, I told her nothing!She looked in the side review mirror and said, \"you had to have hit something\", I checked all gauges, noticed my traction control lite was on, and a little lite on the left side of the dash, looks like a vehicle going down hill with a cloud over it was also lit. Plus the engine was running much faster, the transmission had down shifted.I pulled over, to inspect the front for damage, there was no damage... I even walked back down the road looking for anything I could have struck, there was nothing there at all. Have no idea what this could have been at this time, it has done it several times since the original incident, once very minor at a very load speed approx 10 mph, the other two incidents was at about 45-55mph....

Within the first 500 miles the vehicle began to lurch when downshifting at about 40 MPH. I began to write down mileage and condition of weather to see if I could find a pattern. It was random. Switched transmission between ECO, Sport and normal ( it does it randomly in any setting)I called the Hyundai dealer where I purchased the vehicle and service tech reported that they hadn't had any other complaints. When I took it in for the 1st oil change, I reported it again and they said they couldn't find any problems. They did however, \"reset the computer to adjust to my style of driving\"?. I am a 54 year old female, have been driving a 2004 Nissan Murano for the past 10 yrs (bought used). I loved my Murano with its CVT tranny. I knew I would have to adjust to a traditional transmission again but the jolt\/jerk that happens is unbelievable! This is my FIRST NEW CAR PURCHASE EVER! I wish I would have went with the 2016 Honda Pilot.(my 1st choice). It seems every time I call the dealership, they just tell me to bring it in again. We are going in circles. No one has time to have a car in the shop continuously.I have read other complaints about the hesitation on acceleration when between 1 & 2nd gear (and have experienced that a little) but my biggest complaint is the downshifting ( and its always at about 40 MPH) lurch that occurs. I have had several passengers in my car ask me (did you feel that?) when it happened.I will continue to monitor when it happens, and pray that Hyundai will address the issue. Making me wish I would have leased.","2181":"The transmission shift pattern on this car at low speeds SUCKS! When slowing down and NOT coming to a complete stop the transmission lugs and struggles to select a gear in Normal and ECO modes. Does not seemquiteas bad in Sport mode.Update from Aug 31, 2016:The transmission shifting on this car was AWFUL when we first got it, particularly from a rolling stop or at slow speeds. I learned a few weeks ago from another CarComplaints.com user that Hyundai released a TSB and software update for the car. Took it to the dealer and had software loaded, shifting now seems perfectly normal.","2182":"The vehicle cannot properly shift automatically. When cruise control is activated, the vehicle will stumble and linger in an inappropriate gear, and will takes as long as 15 seconds to either up or downshift, and usually that's due to a complete stop. When cruise control is activated, the same issue occurs, but it has lingered as long as 20 seconds in that state. This happens on a daily basis. When I took it in to the dealership, the mechanic said that it's because the engineers designed the 2017 fleet to idle to \"save gas mileage\". I have it in a report and everything. So to all who are dealing with this issue, it appears that Hyundai did this intentionally and knowingly. And rather than admit this is a huge and dangerous flaw, they are ignoring it similarly to how they ignored the engine problems they had a couple of years back.","2183":"in cruise control going downhill it down shifts-- shouldn't do that. my 2013 didn'tin regular without cruise upshifting. doesn't always go to next gear.hesitates when going forward from a standing start.Dealer said it isn't a problem--bullshit!! want it fixed PP","2184":"I traded in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata because of the possible engine problems. I guess I should have walked away from Hyundai at that point but instead I took a bath on the Sonata and dropped 30 large on a Santa Fe. We took it to NC the first week we had it. I would set the cruise for 75 mph (so I would not get run over by Semi's) and the car on a slight hill would down shift from 6th to 5th gear for a split second and then drop another gear down to 4th and the rpm would jump to 5500 rpm. It did this every single incline. If the incline was big enough this stupid car would downshift going down the incline as well??I told the dealer when I returned and got the deer in the headlight look. Well I have had this car for 9 months now and at 19,000 miles it is still doing it. I just got back from FLA (I live in Ohio) and this car must have shifted 200 times. It drove me so crazy that if they can not fix it I will have to unload it and this time I am done with Hyundai. I took the car to the dealer after FLA and of course they could not duplicate the problem on the test drive they did re-flash some firmware.I will follow up with this complaint if this did fix the problem. As I told them I do not believe this is a transmission problem because when I take the car out of cruise it never downshifts 2 gears at one time. This has something to do with the cruise control logics and the fact that the car does not have enough horse power for such a big SUV.","2185":"Driving with cruise control set at 70 mph. When I approached a slight downgrade in the road the transmission violently downshifted and the engine revved up to 5500. Had to disengage the cruise control for the car to return to normal.

Occurs intermittently and happens when turning left or right. More likely to happen if road surface is rough that vehicle is turning onto. The vehicle will begin to accelerate and then lose acceleration. Although pressing the accelerator the vehicle does not speed up even though the engine revs up. After about 3 or 4 seconds the vehicle then responds and begins to accelerate. This situation does not occur all the time. It may happen 3 or 4 times a week.

This has happened on right turns more often. Can't let my daughter drive car, I feel it's unsafe.","2189":"Purchased the vehicle new mid July of 2017. Periodically noticed that there was a hesitation when I tried to get out into traffic. Very brief but long enough to allow oncoming vehicles to get close enough to cause me concern. I inquired at the dealership and they said to keep an eye on it and if it continued, I was to bring it in and have it attended to. Started to pay more attention to it when my wife complained about the same thing. It became progressively worse (especially turning corners and when the vehicle had not been used for a longer period - like overnight) so I had booked a test drive with a technician who was able to replicate the hesitation. I competed the first service on the vehicle early (5736 klms) so they could look at the hesitation issue at the same time they did the service. They said there was no mechanical issue but said the safety feature with the vehicle ie: when the vehicle felt like it would lose traction, the power would be reduced. I said this was a safety issue but mine not the vehicle! When I need power, I need power to get me out of a situation which may cause an accident! I was advised to accelerate more slowly (!) and if it continued, I could bring it back and they would look at it again. I will be bringing it back again - when you pay this much money for a vehicle, you would expect it to power up when you need it to power up. I drove a 2013 Santa Fe 2.0T for 40 months and it was the best vehicle I ever owned - that is why I went back and purchased a 2017 Santa Fe. Hopefully they can find me a fix.","2190":"bogs down at low speedsI leased the 2017 Santa Fe Ultimate two months ago. The car is really plush but has a problem of bogging down at slow speeds (1-20 mph) when accelerating, particularly when turning. It seems the transmission is unsure which gear to be in. It is truly dangerous and very disappointing for a car I'll be stuck with for 2 years. The dealer is not close by and I had thought to get it fixed at my first service visit but after reading the comments on this site I have a bad feeling that I will be disappointed by the dealer's response. I had a similar problem with a Chevrolet a few years back (though not as scary as this). It was simply a design flaw on a computerized transmission which they did nothing to correctI'm just curious on how this could be allowed by our federal government. The sometimes minor things that trigger recalls is nothing compared to this design flaw. I've been driving it very defensively while awaiting my service visit and can see the potential for an accident. Please do not consider this car when shopping - you deserve better. Mark","2191":"My new Santa Fe 2017 has a problem with the car not reacting to pressing the accelerator. Your press the accelerator and the car does not move and the engine does not rev. The hesitation is about 2 seconds long and is very scary. It happens intermittently and from a stopped position. I'm afraid at some point there will be a terrible accident from this problem. I've had it in to my Hyundai dealership and they can't find the problem. They have suggested I leave the car with them and they hope to be able to duplicate the issue and correct it. I sure hope so!","2192":"The car has a hesitation at low speeds causing a delay in acceleration. As another complaint indicated this can be a serious problem which could cause an accident. I have had this happen when turning left at an intersection. I accelerate but the car just sits there before accelerating allowing oncoming traffic to get dangerously close. I've learned to allow extra time in order to avoid this dangerous situation but the problem is intermittent and unpredictable. To be fair, I have not taken it to the dealer yet and found this site when searching to see if others have had this same problem, which at least one other person has reported. I am adding my complaint here so that Hyundai can see that this is a real issue and that they need to address it before someone is seriously injured or killed due to this malfunction in the transmission.","2193":"hesitation when down shifting between 10 to 15 mphI have a 2017 Sante Fe Limited Ultimate 3.3 liter motor with the 6 speed transmission that I bought in April, 2016 and at approximately 200 miles I noticed that when driving in the normal mode and, also but not as much in the economy mode, the car has a hesitation when you slow down to between 10 and 15 miles per hour and then accelerate. I've done a little investigating and found that the hesitation is from the car down shifting from 3rd gear to 2nd gear. Now most cars when down shifting will have a very slight interruption in acceleration in some cars you might not even notice but the hesitation in the 2017 Santa Fe is so abrupt that it moves your whole body back and forward. This hesitation can also be dangerous, I approached an intersection and slowed down to between 10 and 15 mph and then tried to accelerate through the intersection the car down shifted from 3rd gear to 2nd gear as it should but the down shift took too long and left me in the intersection for a second or two longer than I should have been making the cars coming from the opposite direction dangerously close. I called the dealership at 200 miles and told them about this problem they told me to continue driving the car because the computer in the car is learning how you drive. I continued to drive the car and at 1000 miles it still had the hesitation so I brought it into the hyundai dealership. As I said this is an intermittent problem and it only happened once during the test drive with the mechanic while he was turning the car. He told me that it might be the traction control. When we got back to the dealership he said no code lights came on so there wasn't much he could do so he reset the computer and told me to continue to drive the car. I shut the traction control off and the hesitation continued so at 2000 miles I took the car to another Hyundai dealership the mechanic test drove the car by himself and he said he didn't see anything wrong I then test drove the car with the service manager and the hesitation only happened once. His response was that this was the way the the car was designed and it seems like I just don't like the way the car shifts and since no code lights came on there wasn't much he could do. I am extremely mad you would think that a car that has a sticker price between 42,000---44,000 dollars would have a flawless transmission cars costing thousands of dollars less have a smoother transmission. Now there is a lot that I like about the 2017 Sante Fe so I'm hoping that this hesitation resolves itself on its own as the car continues to break in or hopefully Hyundai sends out a computer update that fixes the problem I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this issue and I have considered taking a loss and trading the Sante Fe in for a Honda pilot. In the meantime for my safety and the safety of others I really have to watch driving through intersection between 10 and 15 mph."},"title":{"0":"Durango","1":"Durango","2":"Durango","3":"Durango","4":"Durango","5":"Durango","6":"Durango","7":"Durango","8":"Durango","9":"Durango","10":"Durango","11":"Durango","12":"Durango","13":"Durango","14":"Durango","15":"Durango","16":"Durango","17":"Durango","18":"Durango","19":"Durango","20":"Durango","21":"Durango
