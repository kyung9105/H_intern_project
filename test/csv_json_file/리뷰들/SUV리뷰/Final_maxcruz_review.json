have complained to Hyundai that the 2017 Santa Fe SE has a passenger side wiper that is too short at 14\". It leaves a 1\" space between the two wipers that leaves a V-shape between the blades that interferes with driver and passenger vision in rain or snow. I replaced the blade with a 15 \" blade and all is fine now. Hyundai did nothing for me in fixing the problem except offer to pay for the new blade. This is a safety problem that should be a RECALL on all the new Hyundai's that have this problem. Disappointed that with all the technology and teams of designers that such a problem wasn't found and corrected before the SUV hit the market.","2":"My wife and I are well into our seventies and have reached a point were ease of entry and exit has become important when it comes to our main transportation. Many of our friends have had knees and hips replaced and are a \"little on the heavy side\" and they like wise have the same needs. With this as a back drop we realized we needed a SUV. Our last car was a 2013 Toyota Avalon a tuff act to follow for the average SUV when it comes to driving dynamics,performance and efficiency. Spent more time researching,driving and comparing vehicles then we ever have in our lives. Looked at SUV's,when comparably equipped to this car cost upwards of $60,000 and kept coming back to the Santa Fe. Wife liked the size of the Lexus RX350 but we both thought the styling was hideous especially the front end and so it went as we one by one eliminated the completion for this vehicle. Yep in the end we just liked this thing the best The fact it was the best bang for the buck was just frosting on the cake. After following the manufactures break in recommendations to the letter made our first trip to see our grand kids. As you can imagine we have made this trip many times. Expected mileage would fall well short of our Avalon but was surprised to see a average of 27.3 MPG going down in windy conditions and 29.5 mpg coming back. Our Avalon averaged around 30-31mpgs. Amazing. Seat comfort was outstanding the seats fit us like a glove. Ride comfort was just the way I like it firm but not harsh and well controlled. Fair share of hills and turns on our route and the handling was very Avalon like once you started to trust it and drive it accordingly. Loading up the Grandkids and the their parents for a short trip got rave reviews and youngest who loved the climate controls in the third row and dug the simulated Surround Sound of the killer 12 speaker \"sound system\". Son in law was amazed how favorably the vehicle compared to their new Acura. Found every feature easy to use and love the old school buttons and knobs verses the latest touch screen menu drive stuff that is the current fad. GPS is a snap to program easier the the Avalon. Almost as good a my Garmin which is still my favorite over all. Hard to fault this car but here goes. The drivers seat has a noticeable ripple in one of the panels in the bottom edge of the seat. Might go away with a little use but if not I will talk to the service manager and Hyundai about it. That's about it for complaints.","3":"We were looking for a mid-sized SUV to replace our 2004 Toyota Highlander which we loved. We test drove the new Highlander and thought that was hard to see over the dash and the engine lacked power. We investigated the Honda Pilot but it looked huge, was really expensive and the dealer wouldn't budge much from MSRP. The dealer actually bragged about the fact that they sell near MSRP. So we decided to try the Hyundai Santa Fe even though we had never owned one before, based on internet and Consumer Reports reviews. I had previously driven an older Hyundai Santa Fe model as a rental and had liked it. So we picked out the Santa Fe SE with the Premium Package based on features\/price and found a local dealer in Massachusetts. They gave us a great quote over the Internet, just a bit over invoice price. You can still figure out dealer invoice prices using a site like MSN Autos. Don't bother using sites like True Car, they basically give dealers a lead on your business and not the best price for you. We did much better looking directly at dealer sites.  The Hyundai dealer was great, very helpful in all aspects of the purchase. All the features we got with the Santa Fe would have easily cost $10K more on the Honda Pilot. We've had the Santa Fe about 3 months now through the NE winter. The AWD is excellent in the snow and the V6 is really powerful on the highway. It cruises at 85 mph easily. We've driven to northern Vermont, and Maine. It has a very comfortable quiet ride. Not sure why other people were complaining about wind noise I haven't heard it. The rear and 3rd row seats split to allow you to put skis in, very useful as you can still get 5 people in the car with skis. Kids in the 3rd row only though. The ride is not super sporty but it has a good road feel. The safety features are excellent. Rear view camera and proximity warning systems on the side mirrors work great. My only minor complaints are that the electronic dash system is a bit complicated, the front seatbelt clips are a bit low and I don't like the feel of the leather steering wheel. Also, you can only listen to the radio about 10 minutes without the engine running, the it shuts off. I think I will get used to all these issues over time. Overall the Santa Fe is an excellent SUV choice, I definitely recommend test driving one.","4":"This is a perfect SUV, it's not overly big or too small.  It's large enough for adequate storage yet doesn't take a lot of space when parking.  The look is also very sporty looking.  The ride is smooth and we've been VERY happy with it.  If there was one thing that I would have added it would have been to have the option of having the back window to pop up instead of having to open the whole door when getting groceries.  But, the back door opens and closes automatically; it even opens on its own when you're hands are full of groceries and can't get to your keys.  GREAT SUV all around.","5":"Great vehicle in every respect, love the advanced technology package, Hyundai Santa Fe rules!!","6":"Only 2000 miles, but so for it's been great.","7":"This is a great car. It looks nice, rides nice, and has great features. The only thing I would say is that the navigation system seems a bit pointless with Carplay\/Android Auto and you can't get some of the more advanced features without spending thousands on navigation. Other than that, I am happy with the vehicle. The seats are comfortable, power is nice, ride is smooth for a SUV crossover. I have no complaints. There is very little room for cargo if the back seats are up but that is to be expected.","8":"Its been 3 months since i won this car. The features are really good for the price compared to competitors.I really like the smart cruise,sunroof and DBL features. And the warranty is reallly good. Below are the areas it needs lot of improvement 1. Navigation : worst navigation system, half of the address are not found 2. Noise, there is considerable road noise coming from behind, which leads to bad ride experience. 3. Lowest fuel economy in this segment. 4. Cargo space is less compared to pilot\/highlander","9":"I really like the Santa Fe so far, have not owned a Hyundai before, have had Toyotas and Hondas, so thought I would give it a try.  This is a nice SUV for us, not too big, not too small, so easy to park, but still hauls all of us and our stuff.  I added a Curt trailer hitch myself and this was very easy to do.  The Santa Fe has a lot of options for the money.  I really like the surround view camera, I do use this often when parking.  Good visibility.  Have a few rattles from back seat and will have dealer check that for me, seems to be coming from passenger back seat.  I had similar small rattles from Toyota Venza I had before, and Chevy Silverado before that - usually it's a cable rubbing, or a piece of trim that needs a little shim or a small piece of felt, so we will see...Also will see how things go with more miles, I do like the long warranty From Hyundai.  Other than the small rattle, this seems to be well built, very logical controls and layout of the interior.","10":"My second Santa Fe.  Had first one for 8 years. Highly recommend.","11":"We looked at the Mazda 9, the Toyota Highlander, the Ford Explorer, the Chevy Traverse, and the Honda Pilot.  Nothing came close to the Santa Fe as far as value for the dollar. We had a 2007 Santa Fe that gave us very little problems and that followed a 2006 sonata that was equally as reliable. Some of the other vehicles had some aspects that bettered the Santa Fe but in its entirety the 2017 Santa Fe bested them all.","12":"i am in the market for an suv with 6-8 seat my option were the Hyundai Santa Fe, KIA sorento, Toyota highlander, and the Honda pilot. I first went to see the santa fe and it looked really nice the drl made it better looking than before so the sales person let me take it for a test drive. as i got out of the dealership and on to the main road it felt like it had power to hit 40-50 mph. but as i was trying to slow down to make a right turn i felt the car just bogged down as i try to accelerate to enter the other street that to me seemed pretty dangerous because the if there was a car coming i could of gotten hit. so the sales person made me turn to another street where there was a lot of bump so i drove around 40 to see how the suspension would perform, and honestly it was the worst ride as i heard loud thump as if the the rear struts were bad or something, any little thump could be heard very clearly, it was far worse for my parent that were sitting in the back because they said that the car didn't even cushion any of the bump and that they were bouncing the entire time we were on that road , it felt like riding a horse. also the brakes are a little mushy for a 4000lb car i would expect the suspension to be somewhat decent . i have a versa and a old 98 town car and the suspension is 5 times better than the santa fe. i felt sorry to tell the salesperson that we weren't interested in the car because of the ride quality.","13":"Worst navigation system on the planet.  It locates about half the destinations I've tried to input.  The system makes no suggestions; just says it can't locate the address.  Even my home at 6200 ***** street, built in 2009 can't be input because the nav system only shows street numbers up to 6199. Haven't been back to dealer yet to have it checked but maybe I got 10-year old software.","14":"This mid SUV has all the bells and whistles for a very good price. Go in and do a test drive. The second row captain seats make this vehicle super comfortable for 4 adult riders. Small adults and children can easily sit in the third row which has it's own A\/C control and USB outlet. When you fold down the third row you have a great amount of space. If you want to flip down the second row captain chairs (which you can do from the rear hatch) the space is massive. The controls are very understandable and with Infinity speakers this car has a very nice sound system. The Hyundai Bluelink for remote start, Google location search and monthly health reports make this vehicle easy to maintain and get to where you want to go. It even has Android Auto and Apple Car Play for the ultimate in getting text and replying to text messages using your voice. Bought it for my wife and she absolutely loves it.","15":"We went through the process of driving all the crossovers that compete with the Santa Fe but went with Santa Fe because of a few facts that are undisputed...\n\nOf all the Crossovers we test drove (GMC Acadia, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer and of course the Santa Fe!) this one by far had the best color choices, best warranty, top of the line safetly features and for us ranked as good as the Pilot in Driveability. It was also the most bang for your buck by a wide margin. We purchased the LTD Ultimate with the Tech package. This is similar to all the most premium models for other brands. I would say that we paid an average of $7000 less than the others which is unbelievable. The Pilot was $10,000 more for the same features!\n\nI love the sunroof that goes all the way to the 3rd row! I have never seen something like this before! I also think that Hyundai Santa Fe is by far the best looking crossover and beats all of its competitors in looks as well!","16":"...Or, let's talk about the Santa Fe Sport's poor brother\n\nDisclaimer - this is a review from a Hyundai owner for Hyundai owners. If you're looking to compare with other similar vehicles, your mileage may vary.\n\nPreviously owned - 2002 Mitsubishi Diamante, 2010 Sonata, 2013 Santa Fe Limited.\n\nIf you like me have been fascinated by Hyundai's 2013 Santa Fe (long base, not Sport), you like me have been charmed by its many qualities and irritated by its few quirks. \n\nOn the quality side - amazing design, amazing bang for the buck. Performance, acceleration - everything was pretty much as it should be. \n\nFor the 2013 model (the first of the series) though, there were a few annoying issues. To name them - a convoluted equipment level choice (you HAD to have the captain chairs on the back if you wanted a panoramic roof), and, probably the one and only real issue - a rear suspension which was too soft for its own good (probably a straight port from the shorter wheelbase Santa Fe Sport), which was ok when driving alone with a light load, but not ok at all with a full house.\n\nThis has apparently addressed prior to the 2017 model discussed here, so if you drive a 2015 for example - this might not apply to you. If you have a 2014 though, it probably does.\n\nThe other issue was that you would probably have test driven an entry level model (same engine and suspension), but once you opted for the limited you had to chime the larger wheels (19\") in, which would make the ride even harsher (why on Earth would all brands decide that \"Luxury\" rhymes with \"larger low profile tires\" is beyond me).\n\nOther than that, the 2013 Santa Fe was pure joy all the way.\n\nEnter the 2017.\nAs mentioned - it's pretty much the same, yet not the same vehicle. So I'll just point the differences:\n\n- It is very easy to mess up a good design, and just like Infiniti did it 10 years ago with the FX, Hyundai has been able to do the (few) subtle changes that changed the design for the worse between the 2016 and the 2017 models.\n\n Compared to it competition the Santa Fe is slightly narrower. In the previous versions this has been nicely compensated with a design which emphasized horizontal lines - including for the lower part of the fender and the fog lights which were horizontal. The 2017 Santa Fe Sport ALSO has horizontal fog lights, which make it look wider a wilder. Not so for the Santa Fe. The vertical fog lights (I'm quite sure someone was very proud with that choice) manage to \"close\" the horizontal line of the car's fascia and to isolate it between two vertical lines going up, making the whole vehicle look narrower and taller. \n\nAlways wondered why the 2017 Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport don't look equally dynamic seen from the front ? Now you know.\n\nOn the back, a change as subtle as inverting the position of the backup lights (on the bottom part of the taillight on the 2017 rather than on the top part in the previous models) is enough to disrupt the lines of a behind which, already by design, is heavier, and different from the perfect behind of the Santa Fe Sport and thus very, very easy to mess up.\n\nLast but not least - the absolutely perfect design of the 2013-2016 Santa Fe alloy wheels in Limited trim, combining elegance and dynamics to perfection, has been updated to a bland, smaller looking (if not smaller physically), average Joe alloy wheel design.\n\nNow that we bashed the exterior, let's enter the vehicle, shall we ? \n\nThe other reviewer's remarks about the interior's plastic put aside (I wouldn't know, have not compared with other brands), I found the 2013 dash close to perfection in design, and almost so in ergonomics. The large central volume radio button (Limited with navigation) was perfect and easy to find, and the rest was up to speed. The navigation has always been probably the most intuitive to use in the car world. \n\nSame for the huge, easy to find fan control button. The only real faux pas were the stupid Plus \/ Minus temperature control buttons, which should have always been rotary buttons (like on my 2010 Sonata, which - behold - had rotary temp control buttons but a linear Fan control button. Eeeeh... they'll get it right for my retirement year...)\n\nIn 2017, the Fan controls are the same or almost (good and bad), the radio is a banal two small rotary buttons setup (bad). The navigation and the head unit have more possibilities, but somehow the navigation screen doesn't look as clean, there is no way to switch between connected phone units while driving, little things like that.\n\nThe front seats are just as beautiful as the previous ones (very, very comfortable for whoever likes german like seats, or \"made of soft wood\", as the French call them). The seat's ventilation is genius. Beautiful thing.\n\nFinally, memory seats. The easy entry\/exit feature I'll discuss later.\n\nNow, let's drive.\n\nOr not. Apparently, space is limited. Let's see if we can add another review...","17":"Buy from a proper dealer who cares for your business, and make sure it was not a smoking Vehicle","18":"This is a good looking, roomy, well appointed SUV with plenty of room for \"cargo\" and passengers.   The two front seats are extremely comfortable...the back seats are nice and roomy but not as plush as the front seats (fold down seats never are no matter what you buy) and the third row is fine for a couple or 3 kids..adults should drive a second car if it comes down to it.   I LOVE the car...it's got 290 HP with the 6 cylinder..runs smooth and strong...power to spare if you need it.  My grandson is a baseball catcher and we go to Travel Ball tournaments all over the place and have enough space in the back for his humongous catcher's bag, a cooler,  folding chairs, a tent, and luggage for 4 on overnight trips.   I've got 28,000 miles on it with NO problems...tires are 19 inch and wearing very well.  Smooth ride, easy to enter and exit even at age 70... and I plan to keep this one!","19":"does not hold there value at all","20":null,"21":"Life with this car after purchase revealed some annoying features. So would you like to leave the sunroof open while you run in the house or store quick? Nope can't do it...you cannot turn the car off and lock it if the sunroof is open. Need to quickly close the trunk because of driving snow or rain? Nope you can't do it...you need to wait for the automatic gate to do it slowly while you wait. Did you put something in the cubby below the radio and then park the car? Good luck getting it out if it's a bulky item because the shifter will be in the way.  Do you plan to sit in the front passenger seat occasionally when you're not driving? The seat adjustment controls are nothing like the driver seat, and as a matter of fact, you'll sit a few inches lower on the passenger side.  Ever drop something between the driver seat and the center console? You'll never get it out without going in from the back seat underneath the seat because it's so narrow you can't even fit your fingertips in between there. Good luck vacuuming the carpet in these spaces because there are plenty of narrow spaces where things can fall but no ability to vacuum.  This car handles well and drives well and has a nice warranty but if you're looking for the basic comforts of a busy lifestyle with kids look somewhere else.  Hyundai needs to ask consumers where they can improve for future model redesigns.","22":"My  2015 saved us during a massive accident. An 85 year old man had his second accident of the day by pulling across out multilane divided highway at just the wrong time. We hit him at something less than the 60 mph limit and both my wife and I walked away from out totaled Santa Fe. The airbags worked so well that I didn't even have bruise marks from my glasses. The only downside is that Hyundai, and everybody else, I suppose, puts the horn button on top of the steering wheel airbag. I wonder how many other people suffer my injury: my hand-on-the-horn got blown back into my chest. It took almost two months for the pain to fully subside, and another month for my hand to regain most of its strength.\n\nTow rating was important to me. If you buy the PIO (port installed option) trailer hitch package, the Santa Fe Limited (and SE) have a 5000 lb tow rating. According to the owner's manual, even with an aftermarket hitch it is only rated for 2000 lbs. After the accident, even though the force of our connected travel trailer impact bent the \"stinger\" 90 degrees into the bumper, but the Hyundai hitch structure seemed undamaged. The impact was so severe that even the trailer was totaled.\n\nAfter the accident we had time to reflect on a replacement car. We felt so well protected by the car and had enjoyed all the features of the Ultimate package that we got the identical car in the 2016. Right away, both of us independently thought the 2016 was substantially quieter; I think they've added insulation and maybe fine tuned the suspension. \n\nI've seen a lot of negative comment about the third row seating. With the SE bench seat it might be a problem, but with the Limited's captains chairs it isn't much of a deal to get into the third row. Just for grins, my wife and I let our daughter and her 6' 5\" husband drive and we rode in the third row for a six hour day trip. Grandsons in the middle. We're both 70 y\/o and it was perfectly comfortable. Having the panoramic sun roof almost reach the third row makes it much nicer.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that Hyundai hasn't incorporated Apple's Carplay into the display system. The existing nav system is nice, but not as good as Google Maps or Apple Maps, plus I have to pay an annual $50 fee to Sirius just to get traffic information incorporated into the nav system. Carplay was supposed to begin showing up in another Hyundai model in 2015 so I figured the 2016 would definitely have it: Wrong! The BlueLink \"turn by turn guidance\", which is $100\/ year is not compatible with the navigation system. Go figure.","23":null,"24":"\"We traded in our 2014 Santa Fe Sport for the bigger 2016 Santa Fe. We love the Ultimate package.. it has everything we could ever want...with bang for the buck.We shopped for the Kia Sorento, Honda Pilot,Nissan Pathfinder and going back to Hyundai was a no brainer. We spent about 10k less than similar cars with similar packages. Owning a Hyundai today is definitely not owning a Hyundai 10 years ago..they are doing an awesome job of keeping up with the competition. I mostly drive around my kids with it..they absolutely love the captains chairs.Going grocery shopping is easy with the automatic gate lift. The navigation is easy to use. Having the AWD has been awesome in the snow. As for reliability.. My old 2014 Santa Fe Sport only went to the dealer for oil changes..never had a problem with it.. so I am very confident with this one. We have gotten many compliments on it's looks.\n\nStill going strong! I still love everything about it. It has only gone to the dealership for oil changes.","25":"Update 3\/12\/17:  The battery discharge warning issue is more persistent and annoying than ever! My original review follows. \n\nIn this review I want to focus just on the one big problem I have with my 2016 Hyundai Limited Ultimate SUV which I wish I had known about before making the purchase.  In general I agree with other reviewers that this is a good vehicle overall and a good value. It does  most things you'd expect from a modern SUV quite well. However buyers should be aware that you cannot  sit  in the vehicle and listen to the very excellent sound system in this vehicle without the engine running! If you do you will get a loud beep sound every two minutes or so along with a warning that you are discharging the battery.  This beep tone is just as loud as the music so you cannot ignore it.  So You cannot enjoy your music in this vehicle in ACC mode knowing you will be hearing this annoying beep every two minutes or so.  The dealer has  advised me that this is so you don't discharge the battery which of course is important. However why couldn't they have designed this car so that something like just listening to the radio could be done without having to run the engine?   On the side of Hyundai, if the battery does go dead there is a Lengthy restart process to get all of the technology reset back to where it was before the battery died.  I could see where this could potentially generate additional service calls, but for someone like me ( and plenty of  other folks I am sure ) who just likes to sit in their vehicle and listen to  their music on that excellent sound system this is a huge issue and unacceptable.  There are plenty of  vehicles out there with equal or more technology than this one  which do not have this problem. This is a design error on the part of Hyundai.  If  I had known this in advance I would NEVER have purchased this vehicle.   I am  NOT looking forward to the next five years of this!    Hyundai is fully aware of this issue and if it  gets enough attention  I am hoping they might take some kind of corrective action  in future models.  I am still holding out hope there may be some future firmware update from Hyundai which may resolve this issue or at least diminish it somewhat on their current offerings.  If not being able to use the radio and other accessories in this vehicle without the engine running is not an issue for you then I think you will be quite happy with this vehicle.","26":"Purchased new 2016 Santa Fe  SE AWD 8\/31\/15.  Added on the Premium Package which offers numerous features. Ride is very comfortable with 19\" tires and very positive steering. This is my first SUV, but searched the market place comparing it to other SUVs with options, price, dependability, and warranty. The Santa Fe had them beat. The 3rd seat is really for the grand kids.  The V-6  has plenty of power for expressway entry and for passing. I have heated seats and wanted air cooled seats, but Hyundai has them with an additional package including a Panoramic Roof which I didn't want or need. I wish they bundle the heated\/ cooled together.  I took a road trip and put on 5,000 miles (averaging 26mph could be better) with no problem.  During the trip stopped in El Paso Texas for an oil change. The dealer treated me very well like I was a local resident. They knew I was from another state, but that didn't matter. Hyundai has a good thing going for themselves. Time will tell how well they back their warranties.","27":"This is the third Santa Fe I have purchased and by far the best!  The comfort, ride and amenities are great.  The new Santa Fe Ultimate is larger than previous vehicles and four adults can ride comfortably.  The third row seating is great if you have little ones.  Your front seat and backseat passengers can control their own heat\/cooling, which is great - I like it warmer and others like it cooler, so everyone is happy.  Haven't had the chance to drive in the snow yet, but, if it is anything like the previous Santa Fe's, I won't have a bit of trouble.  Weather in Denver can get nasty in the winter, but the Santa Fe's have always taken on the cold and snow like a champ.  My only complaint would be the tires.  I usually replace them, as they don't seem to have the tread for winter weather; other than that, I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a larger SUV.","28":"big but not too big,  fabulous acceleration, great price,","29":"I believe this car is the best value, most overlooked, and totally underrated in the three row segment.  It is smooth, quiet, has a nice V6 engine, the interior ergonomics are well thought out, and it is pretty solid to drive.  The cargo space is extremely usable.  I have owned Honda's, Acura's, and Volvo's.  This is by far my favorite car I have ever owned.  There are really only a few things that I do not love about the car.  The headlights are not very good, even with the HID's from the factory.  I upgraded to a better bulb which helped but sideward visibility could be better.  I think they may have fixed this for 2017.  I wish the transmission shifted a little quicker and crisper.  It's a little to laxed for my taste but it's not so frustrating that I hate the car.  I wish the engine was tuned for a little more low end torque rather than high end horsepower.  This would help with everyday fuel economy which is about average.  Lastly I think visibility around the side mirrors and A pillars is sub par.  Having driven Acura's and Honda's forever they really have that down.  Otherwise the car is an exceptional value for the money and the recent 2017 refresh makes it even stronger.  This car will be overlooked by many because it's a Hyundai.  I took a lot of grief from people for going from an Acura to a Hyundai.  Then they ride in it and are blown away.  It is truly 95% of the car for about 75% of the cost if you shop around.   It really has changed my whole impression of Hyundai.","30":"This car is mainly my wife's car. We both really enjoy driving the vehicle as it is fun and comfortable, but riding in the passenger seat gets uncomfortable pretty shortly. I have noticed several others here on this site have complained about the passenger front seat. Some of which have helped the discomfort of it by placing a cushion on the seat, my wife also sits on a cushion while riding in that seat while I am driving.  I have tried using the same cushion while riding in that seat but find it to be very annoying and do not find it to work very well for me. \n\nOur big issue is that when you spend the kind of money required to purchase this type of vehicle you should not have to purchase a seat cushion, or be uncomfortable while riding on the passenger seat, and\/or expect  your spouse or other passenger to ride uncomfortably. \n\nThis is not our first Santa Fe, in fact this is the 5th Santa Fe we have owned and none of the others have had this problem with the front passenger seat. Hyundai should realize this is an issue and resolve it, please! I don't know exactly what the answer would be to fix the problem, maybe they could attach another base etc. to the seat that is already in the vehicles to give them more height, I don't know for sure but I am sure that Hyundai has some engineers that could find a fix for the problem. I sure hope they have made changes to the passenger seat for the 2016 models.","31":"This is my 3rd Santa Fe, my last was a 2006 GLS. The exterior styling makes this SUV stand out in the segment. I was amazed at the high level of interior quality and the standard features in this model. My ONLY complaints are the small glove compartment and that the height of the front passenger seat is too low and not adjustable. I remedied this by installing a front seat cushion (made for automobiles) for my wife. There are plenty of interior storage places. I like the storage bin under the rear floor that also includes a roll up storage compartment cover.\n\nThe ride is very comfortable. The engine is quiet, very powerful and works well with the transmission. The middle row and rear seats are easy to lower and the floor is virtually flat. It's a vast improvement over earlier models where I had to remove the 2nd row head rests to lower the seats.  I make frequent trips to a home improvement store and it's hauled everything I load into it. I really like the A\/C vents for the middle row seats and the heating and A\/C controls for the rear. seats.\n\nThe best car I ever owned.","32":"I went from a 2011 Buick Enclave to the Santa Fe.  It's the perfect size for us.  I like the looks, comfort, overall performance and economy.  Road noise somewhat greater and road comfort not up to the Enclave.  However the real annoyance is the front passenger seat is not height adjustable , this is a real problem for my wife.  In fact had she ridden in the car before leasing it, we would not have leased it.   I've ridden in the seat also and agree with her, it's annoying and neither of us are short people.  She sits on a cushion when we travel....can't understand the design not including height adjustment.  \nThe other shortfall is the nav. system....we loved the OnStar system in the Buick.  This one is OK, but not nearly as user friendly as the OnStar.","33":"It is one of the better 3 row crossovers in the segment.Smooth ride,great handling,refined engine and transmission.Reliable electronics and cool features such as  panaromic sunroof,Heated and cooled seats,heated rear 2nd row seats,smart liftgate and good comfort overall.If there are some weak points it has to do the front seats not height adjustable(my spouse doesn't like it),Brakes not so effective especially under full load and suspension that bottoms out under full load of passengers.","34":"I shopped them all.  Price, within reason, was not an issue.  I really like this SUV a lot.  It rides well, it's quick for a heavy vehicle, it has every feature out there that I wanted, and it seems bulletproof so far.  In mixed driving I got 24.4 MPG in the first thousand miles.  Love the way it looks, the huge sunroof, the power lift gate, the sliding driver seat, the onboard computer control, the solid feel when driving ... Just everything about this vehicle is excellent.","35":"I owned a 2014 Santa Fe Limited for 3 days.  I was t-boned at an intersection, resulting in all but the front air bags deploying and the rear axel snapping in two.  The EMS at the scene kept repeating to me that the air bags and design of the Santa Fe saved my life.  I replaced that Santa Fe with a 2015 Santa Fe Limited Ultimate.\r\n\r\nI had been driving Chevy Tahoes since 1999.  This Santa Fe is a breath of fresh air! It drives like a dream, holds the road well, and the safety features are awesome.  I greatly prefer the navigation system to OnStar.  \r\n\r\nI will be replacing all my company vehicles with Santa Fe's as needed.","36":"i owned a 2011 Santa Fe limited awd and traded for this same model 2015. It's incredible. Everything is laid out really well. I enjoyed the captains chairs for the second row and the third row. I really think the panoramic sunroof is a great feature. However, the most important aspect is the drivability. I would say that the ride is a little stiffer than the previous Santa Fe, but it is miles of an improvement in terms of overall ride quality and luxury feel of the vehicle. I would highly recommend the Santa Fe. ","37":"I traded a CR-v for this Sante Fe.   The CR-V was much more solid, with absolutely no rattles.  From day one, the Sante Fe has had a very annoying rattle in the back end which I cannot locate.  Road noise is more noticeable in this vehicle than in others I have owned.   I am very disappointed.\n\nUpdate:  As of August 2016, I surprisingly still own this vehicle.  Other than the item noted above, there has been only one additional issue.   The molding above the rear passenger window has developed an annoying leak.  Although water does not enter the vehicle, the leak seems to contain some oily or sticky liquid which leaves the window and the door marked and which requires constant cleaning.\n\nUpdate as of Feb. 2017. - After a little more than 2 years, things have settled down a bit.  The rattle mentioned previously is less noticeable and the window area leak is also not as prevalent.  All in all, I like the car.  I especially like the way it handles (steering) and the pick up it has.  Given the number of issues that most new cars have these days, I'd have to say that I am satisfied.  It would be nice if the paint quality was better.","38":"At 49,000 miles engine light went on.  Went through cam sensors and crank sensor.  I think they are suppose to last to 100,000 miles?  Then received recall notice on engine.  Took to dealer because engine light on, again.   Was told they \"tweeked\" the engine and it was up to Hyundai standards.  Next day I lost all power, steering, brakes, etc.  Towed back to dealer, oil regulator went bad.  Sent me on way, again, stating all is up to Hyundai standards. I think part of the recall is metal shredding through engine.  Gee, this is a no brained. To add insult to injury Hyundai offered me below value due to recall. I am driving an unsafe vehicle.","39":"We bought our 2014 Santa Fe Limited, brand new, and I was really hoping that this was going to be the vehicle for the long run.  It has great features, technology, and storage.  Unfortunately, we've had nothing but reliability problems from the start.  We've put 25k miles on it and owned it for 2 years.  The first issue we had was a crack in the black edge of the windshield which we noticed two or three days after driving it off the lot.  The dealership did right by us and replaced it.  Not a big deal, but a year later the replacement also developed, what I can only assume to be, a stress crack as well and needs to be replaced.  Next, the hood had to be repainted due to multiple rust spots forming on the corners.  After that, the blind spot detection system failed and required the passenger side mirror to be replaced.  Now, during the last snow storm we noticed that the car is leaking anti-freeze and from time to time the navigation will go blank and require the car to be turned off and back on again to resolve it.  For the most part the warranty has covered the issues and out of pocket cost will be the anti-freeze leak and new windshield but these are too many issues too fast.  We may be the unlucky ones who got the bad one out of the bunch but I can only imagine what we'll be dealing with at 100k miles.","40":"Had no choice but to rent this vehicle when I selected an SUV via online rental website for my trip.  If I had known that my only choice was this car, I would have asked for a non-SUV and definitely not anything KIA or Hyundai.  Cheap interior, cheap ride.  From the grip of the steering wheel to the road feel, it simply isn't up to snuff with other more venerable economy car companies.  If you're looking for this as a new car because the other makers' SUVs may be a little more expense, then buy used.","41":null,"42":"Not really satisfied with my Santa Fe. There is a problem when the gears shift, the transmission makes a sound. We took it in, had a New trans. (so they say) put in and it still does it! When we took it back in,\r\nthere was a Car hauler there with new Santa Fe's on it, my husband and one of the service personnel took it for a drive and it did the same thing! We've had the car Ten months now and have had no issue from it as of yet. The Bluetooth does not download my phonebook contacts like it should. Cannot get it to download my Home phone number, so everytime I want to call my house, I have to tell it to \"dial a number\"! Sad when you pay that much money on a car and things don't work right! ","43":"My wife and purchased a 2014 Santa Fe GLS, AWD with Ultimate Package, Frosted Mocha in Oct 2014. We paid $36,000+ T&L,  about $15,000 less then our next 2 choices ( Acura mdx & lexus rx350 ). The santa fe top of the line has more features, and rides just as good. Value is unbeatable. Looks, MPG, Ride, and power are top notch. Are friends are always amazed at how good it is ( most people are not aware of how good the Hyundai brands have progressed) \r\nWe now have 4,000 miles, and not one issue","44":"My 2014 Hyundai is a nice vehicle but unsafe when driving on highways due to steering wandering all over the lane I am supposed to be in.  It wanders from side to side and the wandering increases as the vehicle increases in speed over 50 MPH.  Constant steering corrections have to be made just to keep the vehicle in the lane it is supposed to be in and even then it still wanders back and forth noticeable. \r\n","45":"On a follow up to my first review, I thought I would tell you about our recent road trip. My wife and I just completed a 4,000.8 mile trip up to Vancouver Island, BC and back to central Nebraska. Our Santa Fe performed flawlessly all the way. We drove 69 hours and 17 minutes. Beautiful scenery and a great auto. Never once did either of us get tired butt, not once did we have any issues with our Santa Fe. We spent 11 days out, 10 nights. We stopped in Billings, MT at the brand new dealer facility for a quick oil change. Super comfortable ride and drive all the way up and back. We averaged 24.6 MPG driving 3-7 MPH over posted limit, with quite a few miles logged with 80 MPH limit. ","46":"We searched for a replacement for our 2006 Toyota Sequoia, wanting to go down in size. We looked at Toyota first, not finding the Highlander very appealing to us and dealer selection was awful. We also looked at Buick, Ford, GM and Dodge. We were very surprised when we began comparing features, options, overall cost and warranties of all the above. We found the Hyundai to be the best overall value by wide margin. Love driving it and the features are great. We had to drive a long way to find the one we wanted but well worth it!","47":"I did so much research before finally making a decision on an SUV. I am so excited and pleased with the Santa Fe! I purchased a GLS with the Premium and Tech packages, and I could not be happier. The build quality, look and feel, and handling are such a huge leap over my 2011 Highlander Limited. I could not be happier. ","48":"We added this to our 2013 Sonata after the other midsize SUV we lease was bought back by another manufacturer as a lemon.\n\nWe are incredibly impressed with all of the features in this car.\nIt looks great, rides nicely, if a bit firm, has tons of room for 2 car seats and all the stuff that little kids come with and great technology.\n\n\nI admit that the panoramic sunroof was one of the biggest selling features.\nIf you haven't seen it - you must - it beats all other competitors.\n\nThe only demerits I give are on the telescoping steering wheel - wish it came back a little more and the rear view camera - the lines do not move when you turn the wheel - which is weird as the Sonata does.\n","49":"This vehicle has been good for our family for going to activities and outings HOWEVER, it has left us hanging with the AC condensor getting holes easily punctured through the grill causing the AC to completely go out, needing approx $800 to fix and now it has done it again almost 2 years later. I have NEVER had this happen to any other vehicle me or my husband has owned or any of our family. This is again going to be a costly venture as the warranty does not cover however I feel that Hyundai needs to address this issue, perhaps RECALL.","50":"I am writing this review so that others are warned about the product Hyundai is selling.  I traded in my 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport today.  I was the first and only owner, I purchased it in June 2013.  I had the tech package, panoramic sunroof, no turbo.  The engine on this vehicle went bad in November 2016 and Hyundai put a new engine in the car.  Around mid June 2016 the vehicle started running out of oil constantly.  There was not a leak but Hyundai could not find a problem.  I NEVER MISSED A MAINTENANCE and took care of this vehicle. Then one day, black smoke came out of the tail pipe and I left the engine intersection in a black smoke cloud.  I was SO embarrased.  I took the car to Hyundai and they said the engine was bad.  The car is 3 years old.  Shake my head! Hyundai keep the car for ONE MONTH and replaced it.  In less than two week of getting it back, it ran low on oil again.   I immediately decided to get rid of this car before it caught on fire or the new engine went bad.  I read many stories online of complaints about the Sante Fe during the month I didn't have the vehicle so I was concerned the new engine may not fix the problem.  BTW, the hyundai service department guy let me know the new engine cost them $12,000.  I guess they aren't concerned about how much buying a $28,000 lemon has cost me.  I traded in the cross over for a 2017 Honda CRV and I am so happy to have that Hyundai off my hands.   Everything was covered by warranty but Hyundai can't fix the vehicle but it's unsafe.  I feared something really bad would happen and I wouldn't even have anything to trade and still have purchase a new vehicle.  I will never consider Hyundai and their warranty is pretty much useless.","51":"Great car for family or utility.  Lots of leg room for up to 8 people or fold the seats down for plenty of hauling space.  Ride very smooth like a car.  Moderate amount of road noise.","52":"I love our car. Would not get the 2.4 only 2.0 Turbo. Great Performance","53":"Brakes are excellent, MPG is OK, expected better. Seat are to hard, cloth seat might be better.\n2\/2017 - Still a great car, no problems at 43,000 miles.","54":null,"55":"Purchased our Santa Fe Oct. 2013, within the year the cover around the front passenger seats popped off, the material around the window began to peel off,  the front headlight has a second bulb underneath, it detached, there was also this rattling noise when accelerating, and the headrest on the drivers side seat was dis-colored.  Was informed by Hyundai that we were past the 36,000 mile mark and the interior was not covered under warranty.  We were basically ignored and treated as if we did the damage to the car. Next the starter needed replacing (also not covered under warranty) so we paid out of pocket for the repair. Less than six months the starter was acting up again. Took it back to the dealership they said the wire leading to the starter was the problem and that we must have ran over a branch and disconnected the wire. We had the brakes replaced x 2. Next the motor that controls the windshield wipers stopped working.  I hate Hyundai!!!","56":null,"57":"We've owned Ford, Chevy, and Dodge SUVs and currently also have a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. This is the best purchase we ever made in the \"family\" SUV lineups. Being the \"first to own\" a model can be a risky endeavor, but we fell in love with the ride, features and convenience and we made the right choice. Now with 50,000 miles, we've put no money into our Santa Fe Limited other than routine maintenance. An early problem with the A\/C was quickly taken care of under warranty. We've driven this baby on many 1,000 mile trips with comfort that exceeds anything we've previously owned. Great highway mileage (we average 26mpg), pickup, handling and convenience. My biggest complaint is the style of the door cup holders, if that tells you anything! We specifically bought the Limited, which gives you the flexibility of having the panoramic sunroof AND roof rails... And chose the reclining\/bucket-seated second row (captain;s chairs). To date we've never needed to use the roof rack, because the cargo capacity has met our needs for everything we've thrown at it. We regularly transport two band members, 2 Large PA Speakers, Pole Bag, Rack Case, Looper, Pedal board, Gig bag and 3 guitar cases with room to spare. With the guitars and one band member in another rig we can also add a Marshal Stack. The split bucket in the second row gives us great flexibility for 2x4s and long cargo needs. I especially appreciate not having my SUV in the shop all the time, which was not my experience with the other SUVs we've owned. Can't recommend this SUV enough to an active, expanding family. Great SUV.","58":"Hyundai Santa Fe Limited Big Bang for the Dollar.  I will buy Hyundai Again. Great Vehicle","59":"My next Santa Fe will have the turbo charger. The 4 cylinder is ok but I like that extra boost. I have had no trouble getting on the highway but I would like the extra power. We love our Santa Fe and will get another one when our lease is up. I set the power steering to the tightest setting because the other 2 settings were too loose for me. Good value for the money although I would like to see Hyundai's hold their value better. They are good reliable cars, just as good has Honda or Nissan with a great warranty. I have had several models over the years with no major problems. Whatever did occur the dealer took care of very well. As always, it comes down to how the car feels to you when you sit in it. If you are not comfortable no car is worth it.","60":"I bought my Santa Fe Sport 2.0t AWD new in January of 2013, replacing my Hyundai Veracruz that was a bucket list of problems. Starting out the car was great, ran smooth, no noise, comfortable, etc. October 2015, it completely died, the entire engine had to be replaced, what started as a small ticking noise soon turned into what sounded like the engine about to blow out from under the hood. Dealership had the car approximately a month, when i got it back I had the vehicle 5 days before the Turbo went out and had to be replaced, another 2 weeks at the dealership, got the car back again for 7 days, and it died again, this time the dealership couldn't diagnose the problem, had a Hyundai engineer come in and they couldn't figure out the problem either, they somehow got the car running and gave it back to me. Sensor after sensor has failed on the car, the tail lights have all been replaced due to broken seals, fuel sensors replaced, door locks replaced, door handles replaced, all due to failures. I am currently waiting on a Glove Compartment replacement to come since that has recently failed too, and I just noticed today that when i use the front windshield washer that the rear wiper comes on and the front wipers come on while using the rear washer fluid. This car has turned into the biggest piece of junk imaginable. Service department always has an excuse. Avoid Hyundai at all costs.","61":"I have had many close calls not being able to see cars and\/or pedestrians because of the wide trim by the front windshield and side mirror.  It is a hazardous obstacle.","62":"Overall, we love this 6-passenger car that allow folding down of all the seats (except) front for some extreme cargo space.  It drives and handles extremely well...when it lets you.  We all make hundreds of minor steering adjustments every few minutes to correct for lane drift, bumps in the road, wind, etc.  Occasionally, at speeds above 35mph, this car decides it wants to lock the steering wheel straight.  Not so much that you can't turn it, but it takes extra effort.  It gets exhausting over the course of a long trip...and is an obvious safety concern.  The navigation system is not easily updated and it is expensive to do so.\n\nUpdate July 2016.  I now believe the steering issue was related to a fading battery.  After replacing the battery two months ago, the steering issue has not returned.  This may be plausible for Hyundai's electric steering.  I'm increasing the safety rating from 3 to 4 stars.  Other safety concerns are are large front-quarter blind spots and weak headlights.  I'm increasing the overall rating from 4 to 5 stars because all the other places where I didn't give 5 stars are acceptable.","63":"Very happy with my purchase. I really wanted an SUV that accelerated a little slower to keep me out of trouble. :) Im averaging about 28.3 MPG, very quiet car even with eco on. I love how this vehicle handles - I feel more in control! Brakes handle nicely, I use comfort steering which is fantastic, turn is great, parking is super easy. Had a smaller SUV (Escape 4cyl) before this one and it did not handle like this - that car sucks compared to this (personal opinion).  Though there are some rear blind spots, the rear view camera makes up for it. The heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, bluetooth audio and panoramic sunroof are definitely a HUGE bonus. I feel safe, comfortable and can make it to and from work with ease. EXTREMELY HAPPY!","64":"I first bought a Hyundai sonata 2011 which was fair in function considering the cost so I decided to change to the Santa Fe 2.0T\nI bought  this Santa Fe for my wife and our two girls then 4 and 5yrs old.\nFirst problem was  when  one of the rare seat beat  got locked up in my daughter's car seat  as she tried to unlock the seal belt so she could get out of the car while we were in the garage no matter how hard we tried we could not get it released and in fact it got more tightened across her belly to the point she started foaming. Eventually we had to do the inevitable, cut the seat belt to free our daughter. \nWhen we took it to the dealership ,they played it down until I told them I was not as stupid as they may think. After fixing it for us the problem persisted when I took it back they were trying to force me to believe that was how a seat belt was suppose to work. For heaven sake, I have own 12 yr old  VW and the belt worked better. As a result we had to place a scissors in the car and for 6 months my 4yr old did not want to sit in that car.\nThe winter was the worse periods because I had to pull on the seat belt and adjust it several times before getting it to work in the cold freezing winter.\nI paid over $ 550 monthly as lease payment to endure such brutality from Hyundai.\nThere were so many other customer service problems with this vehicle from Hyundai  America to the local dealership including transmission breakdown that the least said the better.\nI decided to add a little more  $200  to get an Acura MDX  and I feel liberated. NEVER again will I spend my hard earned dollars on a Hyundai.   \nThe cost savings is not worth the dangerous risk . What if we were at a shopping mall parking lot and my little darling got stuck and foamed to death as she was choking.","65":"OMG!  Hyundai should be sued over their PATHETIC navigation package, this thing sucks like you wouldn't believe!!!  But... with this car, it's almost required because without the use of the back-up camera you can't see behind you AT ALL!!   I bought my car in August 2013 and the maps were horrible then; completely outdated!  I was told by Roger Beasley Hyundai in Kyle, TX says that I would be able to upgrade my maps anytime for $79, apparently up until now there was NO map upgrade!!  It's now October 2015 and the dealer McLoughlin Hyundai in Milwaukie, OR says I have to pay $300 to get the maps upgraded and there is NO way for them to download any of my markers I've loaded into maps, so the 50 or so plus sites I've marked in the navigation package will be lost forever!!  I mean this is pathetic people!  So I'm to believe that Hyundai is so completely technically inept that they cannot figure out how to upgrade the maps without erasing all your data.  And to top it off the original Nav package just sucked so utterly, it was pathetic!  I'm worried about other things now, if they can't figure out a Nav package, what else did they screw up!!  I like the rest of the car, but the Nav package is such an important part of the car, it just ruins everything that would have been good about this car!!","66":"As with the Edmunds review, we too found the steering to wander slightly on the highway.  Engine is strong and peppy for a 4 cylinder. Quiet interior.  We didn't like the hard, textured steering wheel - became uncomfortable on long drives. Opted for a steering wheel cover for more comfort.\nThird Santa Fe we've owned (2001, 2006 and 2013). 2001 and 2006 easily went above and beyond 100k without any extra effort but routine maintenance. 2013 worlds apart from previous models with design and features inside. \nFront seats could be a little more comfortable.","67":"I leased my Hyundai Santa Fe in 2013 and I am overall happy with the vehicle.  There were some issues early on, one of which was taken care of by the dealer.  My Santa Fe had the \"sqeaking in the dashboard\" issue which apparently a lot of other owners shared.  It was a piece of insulation left out of the production process.  The dealer initially balked at acknowledging the issue but eventually fixed it after having to completely remove the dashboard.  The ride is adequate but tire and road noise is above average for a vehicle in this class.  The 2013 Santa Fe's also have an issue with \"wandering\".  At highway speeds the car will not hold it's lane and requires constant steering corrections which is very tiring on long trips.  In the forums I read where later model years also experience this problem.  The Infotainment System has many bright spots in comparison to other vehicles I've owned and from reviews of other vehicles.  One downside is the inability of Hyundai to update it's software relating to the \"shuffle\" option for the stereo and the salesperson stating the system would play a DVD movie through the touchscreen - which it will not.\n\nApparently it's common for Hyundai leases to include a $400.00 Disposition Fee which is charged to you upon returning the vehicle at the end of the lease.  Granted, this fee is listed on the lease agreement but neither the sales person nor the lease manager pointed it out to me when reviewing the document.  Frankly, I wasn't expecting this additional cost as none of my prior leases ever included such a charge.  I've leased from Lexus, Lincoln, Nissan, Infiniti and Ford and have NEVER been charged a disposition fee upon return of the vehicle - even if not leasing another vehicle of the same type which is the only way Hyundai will waive the fee. I would never lease another vehicle from Hyundai as long as a Disposition fee is charged and would highly suggest anyone considering a Hyundai lease to carefully review their lease documents.","68":"I feel I'm stuck with a defect of a car and an even worse dealership that does not call, confirm or even care.  Radio went out, backpack up camera went out.  Engine noise (knocking sound) continues even after they said they fixed it!  Everyone from service advisor to service manager just doesn't seem to care, in fact they talk to me like I am a bother more than anything else.  Called to reschedule another visit after the knocking sound obviously wasn't fixed, they lied about having a loaner available, in fact the guy that took my call did t even care to pass my message along!  Estimated mileage is an absolute lie, had to manually raise the headlights, because they come adjusted so low.  ","69":"Everything is fine except the head lights. I could not get Hilton Head Hyundai to fix them so while in Asheville I took it to the dealer and within 20 minuets they were adjusted perfect (after two years). What a shame I could not get my dealer in Hilton Head to anything except say that is the way they are suppose to be.","70":"The problems with our 2013 Santa Fe Limited (2.0L AWD) began last July when the engine died (rattling noise in cylinders). Shop foreman requested full engine block replacement, but Manufacturing Company only approved short block. Car was returned 30 days later (no rental given) and continued to have problems. 5 months later, we are back at the shop, having the engine replaced again. Dealership is working with us on a replacement vehicle deal, for which we are thankful, but the Manufacturer has shown no compassion. We will be going to court to reclaim lost time with the car over payments and insurance costs.","71":"I bought the Santa Fe in April of 2013.  I put a lot of miles on my vehicle with highway travel back and forth to work and driving my child to her activities.  Currently my vehicle has 40,000 in October of 2014.  I really enjoyed the vehicle at first, until the funny clunking sound started in the front end while starting off from a complete stop.  After my Hyundai ceritifed service department at Bob Brady Dodge proceded to tell me nothing was wrong with my vehicle and that they had driven it 10 miles, although the odometer had the same mileage as when it was dropped off.  When the service guy rode with me he did confirm it didn't sound right, although they convinced me it was just the AWD.","72":"I bought my 2013 Santa Fe almost 2 months ago. I love all the features that come with the technology package, however I must say I'm a little disappointed. After having the car for 2 months, Hyundai advised me that my radio went out. Are you kidding me? The car is only a year old. So I've gone a few days without a radio, until it can be ordered. Thankful for the warranty, but I worry what will happen after the warranty end. Other than that, the car has seemed to run good. ","73":"It was a great car, until it hit 2 years old, and 30,000 KM (~18,000 miles). A piston broke in the engine, and the engine completely failed. What is worse, is the Warranty department balked on replacing the engine as per the service managers request. Eventually they agreed to a short block replacement and a few peripherals. Even that took nearly 2 weeks for approval, and I have little confidence this will be a long term fix. No rental car offered, and no explanation or apology. Still waiting for car to be fixed, as parts have to be shipped in. Not impressed. It is my second Hyundai, and now my last.","74":"Bought this version in August of 2013.\ngreat riding car with fair fuel economy when in Eco mode. Earlier noise problem resolved by replacing mud flap on drivers rear tire. Map costs $249 to upgrade to newer version and took dealer a few tries to get it right. All bucket seats are nice and fits 6 people easily. Little trunk room unless back seat folded down.","75":"I bought my 2013 Santa Fe Sport in August of 2012.\nI was the second person in Kentucky to own this model.\nAnyway, I've hard my Santa Fe for nearly two years now and I still love it!\n\nI have taken my car to Florida on three trips (1400 miles round trip), I do a lot of driving in town, and take weekend trips in it.\nI haven't had a single problem with my car and now have over 25,000 miles on the odometer.\nThe interior still looks like new, the paint still looks new, and the cabin is extremely quiet, even at high rates of speed.\n\n\nIf I had it to do over, I would definitely buy this Santa Fe Sport again.","76":"I literally test drove every mid-size SUV imaginable in my quest to buy my next vehicle. Coming from a Honda CR-V, I needed more interior space to cart around my large friends (All are well above 6ft tall) and my two large dogs, along with their crates. The Santa Fe was an option I was unwilling to consider, until I drove one. The ride is beautiful, and comfort mode steering helps tremendously. My small frame is a bit overwhelmed by the large seats, but the power seats and lumbar support make it more than comfortable. The options I have: heated steering wheel, front and rear seats, back up cam, navigation, Bluelink and leather seats for less money than a mid range Honda. #hyundaifamily","77":"Bought 2013 in January 2014. One week later heard knocking in the engine, took it to dealer was told that the GDI engines make this noise, normal. 2 weeks later took it back as knocking is not normal and there has been numerous reported engine failures with same noise, vehicle throws random emission codes which there is a tsb for but not all dealers know this so I have to put up with a defective SF. I loved it at first but that ended within 3 weeks. I think the 6 cylinders are more reliable than the 4's. Traded in for SF XL limited, has the 6 cylinder. Update Feb 2017; the SF xl limited has performed excellent.","78":"The new Santa Fe 7 passenger was everything and more. We loved the vehicle that we purchased in April. It provided a great car and towing capacity which suited our families needs. I was in heaven until Nov. with less than 6000 miles.\n\nI am currently in discussions with Hyundai and the BBB since the car is considered a lemon. End of Oct my vehicles fuel injector went out. It has been in the shop for over 30 days because it had to brought in another 2 more times for seals on the fuel injection system that failed. Currently there is no repair date because the parts need to come from Korea and are on back order for a new rail for the fuel injection system. The car is not drivable now.","79":"The 2013 Santa Fe Sport 2.0T AWD is a good all round suv and does attain a fair gas mileage if driven below 70 with the econo engaged. I have one concern regarding the engine as it has happened several times where it feels like the engine has stalled and when you try to engage the gas pedal the engine does not respond. It is quite disconcerting when you are trying to cross traffic when making left hand turns and there is no acceleration. If you wait one or two seconds or feather the gas it will seem to engage the fuel system and you are good to go. It has also done this on the interstates when you are drivng without cruise and the gas pedal just goes dead.","80":"Was drawn by the new design, & stopped by dealership for test drive!\nWow, my wife and I love this vehicle!\n Great power from the turbo, the features and extras make us not want to get out!\n I had the chance to drive on a very windy day on a major highway @ 70mph.\n18 wheelers swaying, leaves blowing, but the Santa Fe was smooth and stable.\nHandles nice,\nbraking is smooth, not spongy, and cockpit is stylish, and not cheap looking.\n Leather heated seats w\/ 3 temps, Bluetooth & bluelink awesome, cup holder in nice position,\nan eyeglass compartment that actually holds my sunglasses - big plus! Gas mileage on Eco, I was able to hit 26.\n\n\nNothing but love for this ride","81":"Shopped 6 months before deciding on the Santa Fe (LWB). Looked at the Flex, Traverse, Acadia, Pilot and Highlander, and dollar for dollar the Santa Fe could not be beat. I test drove it on two separate occasions and fell in love with it. Very compliant ride over our terrible city streets, the interior is nice and quiet and even in heavy traffic my son sleeps soundly in the back. Plenty of options and room for everyone and everything we need to haul around, plenty of power in the V6 and I'm getting 18.5 mpg city, which is the same as I got in my V6 Camry that I traded in. Very happy with my purchase thus far.","82":"My Santa Fe Sport 2015 is my third Hyundai purchase. I traded in my 2013 model to get the new back-up cameras and blind spot detection.  Prior to that, I drove a Sonata. The Sport is versatile and fun to drive. I am short in stature, but with the standard power seat, I have no problem reaching the pedals. Because I am sitting up higher than a standard vehicle, I have greater visibility. The cargo space is a plus.","83":"This is my first Hyundai.\nAfter driving Fords for 30 years, this is definitely something different.\nThe car has 10,000 miles on it, with 2,000 in the last week.\nIt was driven both on interstates and in the mountains and the performance was good in both locations.\nThe mileage could be better, averaged 27 on the road and 24 in town.\nThe interior is comfortable and well thought out.\nWith snow in the mountains the heated seats were a welcome addition.\nOverall a great car for two people with room for two more.","84":"Only 5000 miles since the Dec. 15th 2013 purchase and so far so good. I have had no steering issues at all that I keep reading about. I gave up my 2006 4runner 4.7l V8 with 95000 miles that I loved, to get better gas mileage and 22 city and 30 hwy is great out of this 2.4l . The only issue , so far is the loss of power for a split second or 2 that only happens at an idle when Im getting read to pull out in traffic or say make a left turn. You start to depress the throttle only to have nothing happen for that second or two,quite disturbing for that short\nmoment.This has happened 4 times and the pattern seems to be only on 95+ degree days \n\nafter 16 months of ownership the dash was making a cracking sound over uneven pavement  . Traded the car with less than 10,000 miles on it, I was dissapointed to say the least with the interior build quality........","85":"Bought the car in early 2013, we drive it weekly on the weekends. Loved it until last 2 months ago when we took a long trip in it. It started to surge on acceleration and sometimes fall on its face. Took to dealer and they were unable to reproduce. It gets worse the more we drive it. am now afraid to take a long trip in it. Have driven only a few times since back from dealer. Probably will trade soon as soon as I figure what to try next. Bought a Silverado 2013 this year also and love it, have 12000 miles on it with no issues. Update 4-5-2016, Traded this SantFe to a 2014 Limited, Kept until 3 months ago and at 10,ooo mikes similar chuggle in engine. Traded it to a 2015 Mercedes GLK 350, at 12,000 miles am still happy with it.","86":"I purchased the Santa Fe at Palm springs Hyundai and have two problems. The drivers seat was loose and when you drive away from a stop you felt as if you were going to tip backwards. It was resolved with a quick repair at the local dealership. The other problem is that the gas pedal does not work all the time. You get a dead feeling and there is no power when you go to pull away from an intersection or what ever. It is extremely discomforting when you are trying to cross a lane of traffic and the car does not respond to pressing on teh gas pedal. It seems to be happening more often than it first did. Anyone else have this problem. ","87":"The media said that the 2013 Santa Fe LWB was a Veracruz replacement, but it is not so in reality. They basically nerfed many of the standard convenience features on the Veracruz LTD, so I expect that Hyundai is developing a true Veracruz replacement in the near future. \n\nThat said, the 2013 Santa Fe Limited is a refined piece of work in its own right. The chair is very comfortable and adjustable and the technology package makes the car feel connected. I do concede that the design outside and inside are several notches ahead of the Veracruz. ","88":"Bought Santa Fe 2.0T in July to replace a much loved 2002 CRV.\nThus far have found the car to be very fun to drive, comfortable at highway speeds, and the perfect size for driving around town.\nOnly time will tell regarding reliability and dealer service.\nI have not had any complaints with the steering (as others have reported), and the 2.0T has plenty of power even in the ECO mode.\nMy only complaint is the blind spot created by the severely angled rear windows.\nThey seem to have sacrificed clear sight lines for styling.","89":"We purchased a 2013 Sport 2.0 Turbo Oct 2012 and have only put on 4000 miles since then because of the poor steering.\nPicked it up on a Friday night and was back on Saturday,could not drive it on highway and keep it between the lines.\nHave had it back 6 times, adjusted the alignment, flashed the computer and even put in a new steering column and still have the problem.\nFiled under the Lemon law and have been going through the process for 4 months.\nHave to go through the BBB auto line before the state. BBB is funded by the auto industry, just found out our claim was rejected, even after the arbitrator had an expert driver do the report.\nDON'T BUY WITHOUT DRIVING ON HIGHWAY,WORST DRIVE.","90":"For me this vehicle has one major shortcoming. The front passenger seat does not flip forward to provide added length for carrying\nextra long items, such as 8ft. lumber. I previously owned a 2006 Hyundai Tucson and the back rest of the front passenger's seat inclined forward all the way into a flat position which allowed me to conveniently carry 8 ft. lengths of stock with the rear door closed. Not having the ability to do it on my Sante Fe is a major oversight by the Hyundai developmental Engineering group. I'm confident that there are many owners out there who share my displeasure over this incapability.\nAfter all, The Sante Fe sport is a cross between a car and a truck.","91":"Just bought my first new car in 28 years!\nI had been looking at the Santa Fe SUV for 2 years.\nMatt was great and very informative and I was able to secure a very good deal.","92":"I purchased a 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe (2.0 T AWD) in March of 2013.\nI haven\u00c2\u0092t owned a Hyundai since 1988 and assumed the brand had improved.\nWhile in comparison to the 1988 Excel I owed, quality has made leaps and bounds, but this vehicle still falls short.\nThe steering is erratic no matter what steering mode is chosen.\nDue to this, control of the vehicle, especially at high speeds, is a challenge.\nOn roads with bumps, the vehicle seems to jump when hitting one.\nIf turning a corner and a bump is hit, hold on tight\u00c2\u0085you may lose control of the vehicle.\nThis is a safety concern experienced by many other 2013 Santa Fe owners and to date Hyundai corporate hasn\u00c2\u0092t addressed the issue.","93":"Bought a Juniper Green with Beige AWD 2.0T at the end of July. Loaded with everything, save for remote start. This CUV replaces my old 07 SF LTD. This new version is sportier, better looking, tighter, and a lot more fun to drive. The interior is great, so much more comfortable than my 07. Everything is within reach and very easy to use. The Nav\/Radio\/Back up camera is really nice. The 12 speaker surround sound is concert hall quality. The 2.0 Turbo is a stout little workhorse that has plenty of zip. there's nothing i don't like about my new Santa Fe. \n\nEdit to add, 3 years later, still an amazing vehicle given the silly low price. Runs like a dream, very low upkeep cost, and has a lot of life left on it. Hyundia continues to crush their competition. I see more and more vehicles that seem to have outright copied the Hyundai design. Too bad they charge way more for their vehicle's than Hyundai does. \nEdit to add: 3\/12 years in, she still runs like a champ. Still riding on the OEM tires and nothing other than oil changes and standard maintenance stuff has been needed. We continue to love this car. The features, the ride, the power, and oh yeah, the stereo, all add up to make this a best buy on the market today IMO. We'll keep this for at least 2 more years, and maybe more. I'm waiting on the next generation to arrive. If I like it, I'm buying one. Hyundai fan for life. it is made in America, so there's that.","94":"Just purchased 2WD V6 with Navi and 3 rows of seats.\nDrove from LV to LA, 23.7mpg with ave speed of 67mph.\nVery comfortable, great vision and no\nreal blind spots.\nYou still need to turn your head and look!\nA\/C worked great as temp in LV and desert 109F.\nGreat power, no problems going up any of the grades and able to easily pass.\nCan't tell the difference between 70-90mph, so you have to pay attention.\nTakes a while to learn the Navi system and it's not as good as the Honda Crosstour to learn or use (few more steps and a more difficult menu system).\nHandles very car like and has a compliant (not mushy) suspension. Handles the Pasadena fwy curves easily at >60mph with some body lean ","95":"I bought a fully loaded Santa Fe Sport a few months ago and I am very pleased with my purchase.Not only does this vehicle have a very comfortable and quiet ride but it is also a lot of fun to drive,especially with the 2.0 turbo engine, it feels as quick as any 6 cylinder but with better mpg.Some owners have complained about the steering in the new Sport,I will say that it does have a different feel to it but nothing that you can't get use to after being behind the wheel for a short time,Hyundai like other car makers is now putting electric power steering in its vehicles so you will read this in other car reviews as well,but I will say that it can turn on a dime,and great for making U-turns.\n\n  I just want to update my review, I have owned my Santa Fe Sport for over 3 years now and I still love this vehicle just as much now as the day I first drove it off the lot, maybe even more now. As I stated earlier I still find it a lot of fun to drive and I still continue to get a lot of complements on it, especially from people that ride in it, they can't get over how comfortable the ride is. Over the past three years this SUV has been trouble free, the only time I had to go back to the dealership was for regular maintenance. I highly recommend the Santa Fe Sport with the 2.0 turbo engine, would I buy it again, without a doubt I would.\n Just one more update, I have owned my Santa Fe Sport for almost 4 years now and it continues to be trouble free and very reliable, it is as tight and as quiet as the day I drove it home from the dealership for the first time.","96":"I traded in a 2010 Santa Fe Limited FWD which was fully loaded for the 2013 GLS AWD.\nThe car is a serious upgrade in every way.\nThe external styling is much improved.\n The internal styling is also lovely, with much improved materials, backup camera and navigation system.\n The biggest improvement is in the overall ride and quietness.\nThe previous model was quite noisy and you felt every imperfection in the road.\nThis model is as quiet as a luxury sedan and goes over bumps very smoothly.\nAlso, the previous model exhibited serious understeer when accelerating.\nThis one does not, probably due to the AWD.\nSo far, I'm getting better than advertised gas mileage.","97":"I really enjoy my New Santa Fe, this is my 3rd Hyundai. I owned a GT Elantra (manual) and I still have my 2005 Santa Fe GLS, at 126,000 plus miles it still runs great.\nI tested BMW,Subaru, Audi, Explorer, Toyota, and after testing the new Santa Fe, I opted for another one.\nI chose Pearl white, first time with a bright color, my 2005 is black. Love to drive it, everyone loves the interior and exterior.\nMy only concern had been the reviews on steering, so I tested roads, city and highway driving.\nPeople need to understand its a new technology, electronic, and all modes are sensitive to roads and conditions, and each wheel is sensitive to dry, wet, rocky pavement.\nLove it, I feel secure!\n","98":"I traded my 2002 GLS (that I purchased new and absolutely loved) for this new 7 passenger model. Although the interior and exterior are great there are a fewl things I'm not sure i can live with. 1. The gas petal is mounted from the bottom not the top as in a normal car and\nI have yet to find a comfortable position. I think it will be impossible not to use the cruise control on a long trip.\n2. Steering is terrible and floats all over the road (doesn't matter what mode). Just doesn't feel tight.\n3. The drivers seat adjustment does not allow the bottom of the seat to be raised in the back. 4. The passenger seat cannot be raised and it feels like you are sitting in a hole. ","99":"I traded in my 2010 Santa Fe Limited for a 2013 GLS with AWD.\n I would have like to have gone for the\nLimited but I wanted 7 seats, and not 6.\n\n\nSo far, I have to say that for the most part, the vehicle is much improved.\nThe exterior is much more handsome, although you lose a little rear visibility.\nThe interior is vastly improved, with much more comfortable seats, higher material quality, and hugely improved instrumentation and controls.\n\n\nMost noticeable is the improved quietness of the car, and the vastly improved ride quality.\nIn the older version, you would feel a big jolt over minor potholes.\nThe new one adsorbs the impact so that they are barely perceptible.\n\n","100":"let me start by saying that i've previously owned four straight Audis, the last of which felt pretty boring to me, so it was time for a change. after test driving numerous vehicles (including BMW, Porsche) i took a spin in the sante fe 2.0T AWD, and was frankly shocked at how nice it was. i've purchased one and i couldn't be happier -- it's quiet, refined, peppy, smooth, handles well and is actually fun to drive. very nice set of features, and of course an outstanding warranty. and all this for half (or more) of what i would have paid for a German counterpart. unless you feel obligated to impress your neighbors with an expensive nameplate you owe it to yourself to take one for a test drive.","101":"We have had our Santa Fe for a month now, so far so good. Steering takes a little getting used to. But I find the that on low beams, the lights make a line that is very anoying when driving on the highway. As anyone noticed this problem, if so how can it be fixed.\nThe vehicle is brand new to us, never driven a Hyundai before always GM's which were very good.","102":"Never owned a Hyundai product, I was smitten by the high style high feature content at a competitive price. My first Santa fe was so riddled with problems Hyundai gave me another. The second has less than half the problems as the first with one common issue that botheres me most, the vehicle randomly shuts off! This has only happend four times in 9 months but it's very serious problem in my opinion. Its very random- the suv loses all power and just stops, it restarts straight away. So far two dealers cannot figure it out. My other two gripes are terrible fuel economy, and interior rattles. Overall I'm much less than happy here. There are other owners who feel the same way I've spoke to.","103":"We purchased our Santa Fe in Jan 2013 and have had many issues with it. The steering is terrible and apparently nothing can be done. We have had 2 alignments already but it has not helped how the vehicle wanders and pulls.We had to have transmission replaced at 4,800 km and there was a recall on the back up sensors that could short out and cause a fire. At 5,200 km it is experiencing stalling and rough running issues as well as check gas cap light. Not impressed with hyundai refusing to pay for towing over 100 km since we do live in rural Alberta and closest dealership is over 100 km away.I have been left stranded by this so called new vehicle.I have lost confidence and now afraid to drive .","104":"I really want to love this car. I love the exterior and interior design and all the features it has.\nFor these reasons, I would say the car has good value.\nHOWEVER, I have had the car not even 2 weeks and cannot get used to the 4 cylinder, which I'm assuming is the reason the car has NO pick up.\nIt takes too long to get going every time I have to accelerate and this makes me dread every single traffic light\/stop sign.\nMaybe it is because I am coming from the 6 cyl. tuscon, but it just doesnt seem like enough power for an suv.\nI dont remember my test drive being like this so I'm tempted to go drive another one at the dealership andsee if it's a problem with my car. Anyone else have this?","105":"We've only had our Santa Fe Sport for a month but so far so good.\nSo this review is about my experience dealing with Hyundai. In shopping for the Santa Fe, we found out that they are very limited on their availability for certain models.\nWe were looking for Santa Fe Sport in Cabo Bronse with the popular package.\nThere was NOT ONE in California.\nI also found out that there were only 3-4 in the state with these specs with colors only in white, black, and silver.\nThe dealer said they can get our choice color, but the could not, so please research and shop around before buying.","106":"Pretty good vehicle. We are happy with the design and appearance so far. Still breaking it in, so can't give you an estimate on the gas mileage that is valid, nor how it agrees with the manufacturer, but so far, city driving has given us 18-20 mpg. The car has plenty of power, if you feel you need more, then you should get a V-8 or a sports car......this car is plenty good and gives power when needed, and decent fuel consumption. Third row seat is no good for anyone taller than 5' 10\" - unless you are driving a basketball team, someone will be shorter, and those people can survive on even longer trips. I am 6' 4\" and the first 2 rows have plenty of room. The panoramic roof is awesome!","107":"I love the car for the most part, I go commute to and from school as well as work and outings with family and friends. In mixed driving the computer shows an average ranging from 24.5 to 27.0 MPG with the AWD turbo. Not sure how accurate that is given what the dealer said it should be getting HWY, plus the car always states about 330 miles until empty with a full tank. Took a 300 mile trip and only used half a tank, not complaining though. Only issue is servicing the vehicle, Hyundai service always has something else to blame. I installed HIDs and a SUB 3 months ago, 2 days ago an Engine Control System warning comes on, Hyundai blames the after market parts, says its an electrical spike.","108":"I got the Santa Fe with a trade-in, and the total cost was about 29K (before trade) with the warranty\/gap\/taxes etc. Although I did not get a package like the sunroof, leather interior, rear view camera, gps, etc., I think the base model is still a great deal for the money I spent. I need an awd due to my location, and this vehicle is the best option out there for this price. I also checked options like Ford, Nissan, Mazda and Honda, and I would have to spend an extra 5-10K just to get the same level of comfort\/performance from the other brands. ","109":"The beige dashboard panels glares horribly off the windshield.\nCheck this out before you buy.\nMaybe you can ignore it - I can't.\nI have put a black towel over the panel to the left of the steering wheel to knock out the glare.\nAnd awful blind spots, particuarly on the driver's side.\nI had to put a \"blind spot mirror\" on outside mirror.\nHyundai should be put in those \"blind spot warning lights\" in the future.\nThese are the only two things I have to say against this car.\nOtherwise, I love it.","110":"After looking at several different SUVs, we decided upon the Sante Fe.\nYou will be challenged to find a different SUV with the options provided on the Sante Fe.\nThe passengers in the back also have heated seats that they control; very nice.\nThe steering is crazy sensitive, and the mpg is no where close to the advertised or what is displayed on the dash; do the math! (#miles \/ #gal put in).\nOverall, disappointed Hyundai STILL having mileage issues.\nI commute weekly (120 miles round trip).\nThe average mpg shown on the dash is always higher than the actual by 3-5mpg!\nBeen to shop multiple times and dealer agrees there is a problem. overall, I average 22mpg","111":"First cross over I've ever owned always had SUVs.\nSo far I love it, very classy,comfortable, snappy!\nI hope it is everything I am expecting. ","112":"We purchased 2 SFS in November.\nMine is the 2.0T and the other is the 2.4.\nBoth are exceptional CUV's.\nThe AWD has been wonderful in the snow too.\nThe 2.4 get 22 in the city and the 2.0T has been getting 21.\nHighway for the 2.0T averages stays between 26-28.\nFor an AWD CUV I am happy with the MPG.\nI've had experience with the 2.0T in my 2011 Optima.\nThough the HP is less in the SFS I am more than pleased with the power.\nThe only issues we have had is trying to decide which one to take!!\nAbsolutely love the purchases we made. ","113":"I bought our Santa Fe 2013 in Canada mid Sept 2012. We have experienced many issues after 6 months and 14,000 km (8,700 miles):\n\n1) warning of fuel cap open (fixed after 2 visits) 2) noise on steering column could hear it when stopping the car, part ordered and changed problem solved\n3) leather steering wheel cracked, changed warranty, 2 complaints)\n4) driver seat was loose, it seems to be a widespread problem (fixed 3 months)\n5) Recall of rear camera:risk of fire, fixed \n6) Mix mileage is poor, best achieved was 8-10 km\/l, not solved (Hyundai Fuel program: card with CAD$42\/6,000km a big joke)\n7) Found today water leak on driver side below the dashboard. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR!\n","114":"My wife and I picked up our Limited SFS a week and a bit ago and it has been fantastic. I have been reading reviews on here prior to purchasing the unit but after a few test drives we decided to trade in the Tucson and upgrade (and what an upgrade it is). So far we have put on about 650kms but so far so good. No issues with steering, no leaking (ran it through a few touchless car washes) and heat in the rear seems fine (my wife says its comfortable for her and our 1 year old). Knock on wood nothing to really complain about except that its missing a power lift gate!","115":"We put on about 1500 miles on it so far. Great interior and exterior design. It's very quiet, more so than the CRV and RAV4.\nIt's very comfortable and smooth. There are blind spots, but if you pay attention and add a blind spot mirror (and actually turn your head to look like you're suppose to), then it's not that bad.\nMPG is 18-22, 27-31 in the highway, with a 24 avg, depending on the condition. Had to replace the gas tank due to a melted hose,w which caused the gas pump to shut off thinking it's full, but no problem since. Overall, we're happy and satisfied with the car, but the long term eval is still to be determined. ","116":"I recently hit 3,200 miles on my 2.0T with front wheel drive.\nI've noticed some strange issues with the fuel gauge, and after some research on various message boards, the issue is very common.\n\n\nThe dash display of the Santa Fes includes digital readouts that show you your average MPG on your current tank of gas ,\nyour estimated range (how far you can travel until you need more gas), and a bar composed of little \"bricks\" that shows you how much gas you have left.\nThe bricks disappear as your gas tank empties.\n\n\nUntil Hyundai fixes whatever is wrong with them, expect wildly inaccurate readings.\n\n","117":"My wife and I just purchased the 6 seat Santa Fe 2013 that arrived last week. We had looked at the sport but waited on the larger model. So far we are pleased with the car, the appearance and technology are great.\n\nWe have not had much time to road test it but have encountered a problem, the passenger side floor was wet after a day on road with the AC on, there was also a little water on the driver side. The dealer was closed and we are dropping it off today, no idea if this is related to the AC drain or evaporator yet.\nNot happy with the idea that much water was in the cab for at least a day, could cause rust and mold. \nI will post after we find out what happened\n","118":"Brand New and runs with the reliability of a 1989.\nI have had at least 6 instances in which my new Santa Fe would not start.\nIf it did it would stall immediately.\n(Its an automatic).\nIn the last case it had to be towed and I am currently driving a rental (again).\nClearly at this point... NOT RELIABLE. ","119":"Had the car for 2 weeks.\nThe steering can be a little scary until you get used to it.\nOther than that it is a really nice car.\nLots of pep, comfortable ride and 22.8 MPG.\n\n\n","120":"Where to begin? This SUV has been nothing but trouble since rolling it off the lot. I've been in for warranty work 3 times in two months, with more scheduled next week. In fact, I've driven more rentals and courtesy cars since owning this than the car itself. Issues I encountered: rear heater only blows cold air, the back window simply\nshattered had to have replaced (no lie), lumbar button mounted improperly, and only went one way, dash display intermittently cuts in and out, the bluetooth quality is atrocious, the trim paint in the interior will chip off if even breathed on too hard, It wouldn't even turn over twice, still more to list! Beware of this ride. It's riddled with defects","121":"My hubby bought this car in October. Overall we like it, but there have already been some issues.\nIt took two visits to repair the driver in-seat heaters (finally they put in a new heating unit). After two visits the rear vents still don't work. Once or twice we've got them to blow mildly warm air but it couldn't be called heat - and we live in Minnesota. The backseat passengers feet freeze.\nAnd, finally, the radio display locks up while playing from an iPod.\nI am planning on purchasing a car for myself soon - and the lack of warmth in the back of the vehicle is a deal breaker for me. ","122":"I love this SUV....but there is an engineering flaw with the rear seat heating. The seats are heated, but the vents will only blow cold air from under the front seats. The manual even says that the heat is reduced in the rear, and to keep the rear side vents closed in the winter. You can get heat from the side vents, but cold air is always blowing on your toes. For a $37,000 SUV with every option, this should not happen. The dealer told me there was nothing they could do to fix it.\n\nMy mileage in ECO Mode is 21 combined using winter gas. It should get better using summer gas.\n\nHatchback is hard to open and is not assised very much. No power option or inside release. \n\nNo memory seats. ","123":"It's really my wife's SUV although I've driven it more than she has on three trips.\nThe first trip was 1200 miles and the second was over 1400 miles with a shorter trip of 800.\nThe Santa Fe Sport is very tight and its snow white appearance\/color makes it very attractive with it\u0092s the beautiful 17 in. mag style wheels.\nAlso, it\u0092s really not that small and the exterior and interior are both well designed.\nThe Nav is great except for the stupid step of having to agree to safety rules every single time you get in the vehicle.\nLike that is going to make you drive more safely or something.\nAlso the Radio\/Stereo is also very good.\nInterior coverings and amenities are of high quality.","124":"I have owned this car for 1100 km's and so far the two front seats needed to be repaired as they came lose and wobbled.\n But my biggest problem is the car has no heat in the rear vents.\nAn issue for car owners in Canada!\nTook it to the dealership and they said it was a design issue and nothing they could do?\nSo, I am stuck with a car that doesn't heat the back-half of the car.\nActually it blows cold air, which makes it worse.\nThe car looks great, but stay away from this one, looks are deceiving. ","125":"I only have 500 miles on the car but I did have a scary steering problem with an easy fix.\nDriving on the freeway I was also experiencing wandering and went to the dealership to return the car.\nWhile at the dealership I by chance checked the tire pressure, all tires were at 45psi, we let the air out of each tire to 35psi and she's been driving like a dream.\nI filled up yesterday and parked at home with a 22.3 mpg computer reading.\nI went skiing this morning 1st going for coffee and then up a Canyon to a ski resort.\nAfter a most excellent day of skiing returned home with a computer reading of 23.9mpg!\n\n ","126":"This isn't a review about mechanical issues since it's too new to tell.\n\n\nI've had my new Santa Fe 2.0T (FWD, base package, no frills) for a couple of weeks now.\nI love it.\nIt is a comfortable, quiet, fun car to drive.\nThe 270+ hp turbo engine has no problem pushing up the steep inclines of the Texas hill country.\nIt doesn't even blink.\nYou'll take a bit of a hit on gas mileage over the non-turbo model, but it's worth it.\nThe non-turbos are just sluggish.\n\n\nThe interior is very comfortable, has great looking trim, and the standard options on the base package are impressive.\nHeat seaters, power everything, bluetooth, all of the things you want.\n","127":"I bought the base model and this thing has everything I need.\nThis is the first Hyundai I ever drove or owned and I am very impressed and pleased thus far.\nThe dash is nicely laid out and has all the features you really need.\nThe defroster works extremely well and the blue tooth was easy to set up.\nI'm averaging 27.1 mpg.\nI would highly recommend this vehicle.","128":"We purchased the 2013 Sport (5 seater) with the 2.0 turbo, front wheel drive, with the popular and premium packages. The popular package is pretty much standard on all models and the premium adds saddle interior with leather, rear camera, heated front\/rear seats, power front seats, etc.\nReally didn't want to spend the extra 2 grand or so on the premium option but in the end, we decided the package was worth the money.\nPlenty of interior room, initially my wife was worried it was too large, but after driving it, she realized it didn't feel as large as it appeared.\nThe ride is very solid and comfortable, the turbo gives plenty of oomph, interior is gorgeous, and the quality is excellent.","129":"We have 256 miles on one week old 2013 Santa Fe Sport -non turbo.\nGreat car, great style, good warranty..... however power steering is scary on straight highway.... it constantly requires correction to keep it on the road.\nShould have read up on this one before purchase.\nDealer says all is OK....alignment, tire pressure, steering system.\nWas told to just get used to it....not happy at all....will be taking it to the next level soon.\n Recommend a 30 mile highway test drive before purchase.....","130":"I come from a family very loyal to Toyotas and Hondas, but even I have to agree that today the South Koreans easily win on styling\nand features, and are barely a notch below the two Japanese heavyweights in terms of reliability.\n\nI purchased my Santa Fe 2.0T FWD about a month ago after extensive research.\nVery pleased with the purchase overall.\nCan't beat the value and it is true that this thing looks, feels, and drives like a European car.\nNo surprise -- the chief design engineer was hired away from BMW and formerly designed the X5.\nI do mostly city driving on it and still have my second car, but so far so good.\nGas mileage at 20mpg is terrible considering I don't drive aggressively.","131":"Great car,fun to drive. Gas gauge is notoriously inaccurate","132":"I am extremely happy with this CUV. The AWD works very well and has already proved itself in the snow.\nPrevious car was a 2011 Optima Turbo, so I am very well acquainted with the 2.0T. Even with 10hp less and weighing several hundred pounds more the Santa Fe feels nimble and has plenty of power.\nThe highway Mpg is less than my optima was, but I am getting roughly the same in city. Still fill-up every two weeks as I did before and we live in WV.\nMy better half has the 2.4 with AWD and loves it too.\n\nThe only thing I miss are the blinkers on the mirrors, but I wasn't adding another package just for that.","133":"Bought the 2.0T after an extensive search and reading reviews. Test drove the 2013 Equinox, Grand Cherokee, Highlander, RDX, Pathfinder, and Edge and Escape. All were good vehicles but the 2.0T was the most impressive - size, space, speed, gas mileage, amenities, looks and at a decent price. Out the box the 2.0T is an excellent redesign. I am getting about 24 mpg combined after about 700 miles but my goal is to get closer to or exceed the EPA estimated 27 mpg by playing more with the ECO setting. Took a road trip of about 500 miles last weekend and the 2.0T never struggled (no whining at all) when going up hills or passing vehicles going up hills at 75 -80 mph\u0085I was thoroughly impressed.","134":"Nice looking exterior and interior but given recent reduction in EPA mpg and so so performance of the 2.0L turbo it makes me wonder if buying a competitors product with a V6 engine would have been a better choice. The 2.0L is smooth and responsive but in the final analysis it falls short in the performance department, I have the AWD version.","135":"Don't believe even the revised fuel economy numbers that Hyundai says the 2013 Santa Fe can get. I bought my Santa Fe assuming I would get very near the (at the time) advertised 33MPG highway, god I was wrong. I have owned the vehicle for 1 month today, it is currently in the shop to find out why my mileage is soo terrible (21 MPG) mixed use. Mind you I drive the car very economically to get better mileage. NOW Hyundai says OOPS we goofed, we lied about the numbers, turns out your car is a gas guzzler, here is a $65 visa gift card for your trouble. HA! $65, thanks but no thanks! Also, the dealer checked under the when I got there the car was almost out of coolant after 1100 miles.\n","136":"After 2 months of research and driving a lot of CUV's we were getting very discouraged with what we were finding. CX5 was way too slow (especially after owning a Mazda 3 for 5 years. Ford Escape was nice but doesn't seem to get as good of MPG as EPA states and was very cramped in cockpit.\nCRV was comfy but seemed cheap on the inside & sounded like it was straining & had a lot of tire noise. Sorento had worst ride I've ever experienced (after everyone commenting on this, you'd think they would fix that) 09 Lexus RX350 was our first choice, it was awesome but was $1,500.00 more than the new Sante Fe and had 38k miles & would only give us another 62,000 miles of warranty being \"Certified\". ","137":"This is my 1st Hyundai and Suv. The ride is much better than I expected and have not had any problems with the blind spot, it's just a matter of paying attention on the road. Engine repsonse is going to take awhile to get used to since coming from an Accord. Not a fan yet of the eco drive, seems to shift out way too soon. Interior quality is beyond expected and more sporty,rugged than the 2012 model. Love the leather, love it. I can already see the matte finish on the dash and door panels\nis going to show grease from fingers, I keep a mico towel handy. With 1,100 miles, so far I'm pleased with the purchase, and I'm a tuff customer to please.","138":"I've only driven my Santa Fe sport for 2 weeks (500 miles) so far, so I'm still in the honeymoon phase and cannot speak for things like reliability.\nI love it so far.\nIt's very quiet to drive, and the steering wheel gadgets are awesome - bluetooth, radio controls, etc.\n\n\nThe styling is great, and the hidden compartments below the rear floor are bigger than any other privacy space in this vehicle class.\nPower is good.\nThere are a couple of odd shift points, but not issues going up hill or getting on the highway. The proximity key is nice.\nThe whole family thought this was the most comfortable in this class, and also the quietest.","139":"After reading the reviews and testing the vehicle for ourself we bought one, but not the one we test drove.\nThe steering problem was not in the first one we tested but slightly in the one we bought.\nSwitching to Sport pretty much made it go away.\nIn my opinion its non exisistant now because you adapt and I think they put the front wheels very parallel without much Toe-in and that makes for in very good fuel economy.\nI normally average 31 MPG! with a mix of 60 mph highway and town driving.\nTop Highway for me is 34MPG and this makes vehicle outstanding!\nI have the FWD and my previous vehicle was a Nissan Murano AWD, which I don't think I ever used the AWD.\nI could not be more pleased.","140":"We have owned a new 2013 Santa Fe Sport for one month now.\nWe have traveled from Chicago to Mackinac down thru Wisconsin and a week later from Chicago to Branson, Memphis, Nashville, Gatlinburg and back.\nApprox. 3000miles all together.\nOn the low side we got 22.5 mpg to 28 mpg on the high side.\nThis was done in moderately hilly terrain and a tight new engine.\nMy wife loves it.\nThe standard 4 cyl engine has good pep and 6 speed transmission works well.\nA VERY quiet ride for a SUV. Leather seats are comfortable with good adjustments.\nHandles and brakes with good feel.\nWhile the steering is on the light side with not a lot of feel, I\npersonally wouldn't call it dangerous.","141":"I bought this vehicle a week ago and have to advise you to not purchase until Hyundai has a solution to the steering problem.\n\n\nThe car doesn't track straight at all, darting left and then right requiring constant and exhausting corrections to the wheel.\nThe wheel doesn't center itself.\n\n\nTo explain what I mean, while going around a curve if you remove your hands from the wheel, the car continues to go around the curve.\nIt never makes any movement to center the wheel and track straight.\n \n\nAt highway speeds I have never felt less in control.\nEven with two hands on the wheel driving for more than 15 minutes is a frightening and tiring experience.\n","142":"I very much like everything about the car except the steering.","143":"Excellent vehicle. Love it. Just want a new red one.","144":"We purchased a new 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe 4 1\/2 years ago. About 7 weeks ago, the radio died and does not work. We were informed the warranty for electronics is good for 3 years. The dealer is willing to help us out for the cost of a new system, but Hyundai is not. Why would the radio die after 4 1\/2 years of use? Needless to day, I am not sure if I will ever purchase a Hyundai again. I guess the advertised 5 year warranty is not what you pay for.","145":"I use this car to tow my raft for fishing, hauling my dog for exercise, retrieving groceries for my wife, and general transportation.  I have put 40,000 miles on this car without the need for virtually any repairs. Vehicle has been regularly maintained (oil changes, periodic mileage driven inspections). New All season tires.","146":"Have had for 4 years with no problems. Very quiet interior even at highway speeds. Stiff ride, but handles great and seats are more comfortable than most cars.   Gets very good mileage for a V6 engine, with power to spare when you need it.","147":"I bought one of these and treated it well throughout its life. All maintenance was performed as per the manufacturers recommendations.  At 128,000 miles, the engine failed catastrophically without warning.  At normal highway speeds, a piston shattered without warning, and blew through the bottom of the engine.  At the time of the failure, gauges indicated normal engine temperature, oil pressure, and RPMs.\nIt is my opinion that these circumstances can only point to a manufacturing defect or a isolated and documented service error.  \nWorse, Hyundai USA failed to meet agreed obligations.  a Hyundai certified remanufactured engine was ordered and paid for.  28 days later, I was advised that they no longer make this engine. They had my money, my car, and now the only option is for a salvage engine, and a possible lawsuit.\nI am aware that [non-permissible content removed] happens, but the company's actions are reprehensible, and should make everyone reconsider a Hyundai purchase.","148":"No memory  no power passenger seat, no power lift gate.","149":"I drove my 2012 Hyundai 6cyl SE for 3.5 years and 90,000 miles. No glitches.  I changed from Subaru when my 13th displayed multiple flaws in quality, reliability and design.  Hyundai is what Subaru used to be but with better styling.  It's affordable, reliable and fun to drive.  I recently traded it in on a 2016 Santa Fe 6 seat with 6cyl. and am pleased with the evolution to the new design.","150":"Don't be misled by the appearance of the comfort of this vehicle.  The 2012 Santa Fe, while performing well, is loaded with subpar craftsmanship and design.  After not even 3 1\/2 years I have had pieces literally fly off the car, constant recalls and a myriad of simple things being replaced -- from light switches to a sun roof that leaked.\n\nHandling is OK, but there is more than comfortable body sway on corners.  Winter driving is OK, but if you're in heavy snow areas, winter tires are highly recommended.  The Blue Tooth set-up is second rate as is the navigation.  In fact, the navigation is so whacked out, that even the dealer I bought the car from did not how to use it.\n\nAdjustments for things like auto door locks are non existent and the appointments, such as switches and controls and second rate  -- at best.\n\nQuite honestly, if Toyota's Rav-4 did not have the goofy side-opening rear door (which they have since done away with) I would have gone with that car, or maybe the Chevy Equinox.\n\nI generally keep my cars for an extended period of time, but this will not be the case with the Santa Fe.  As soon as it's paid off, or hits  50k miles -- it's gone.","151":"My first Santa Fe was a 2011 GLS, which someone hit while hubby was driving.  Santa Fe was totaled, but the husband lived to tell the story.  It rolled to one side, skidding a hundred feet before crashing into a median cement block directly in front of the police department. It did its job well for a direct high speed hit to the side.  Which is why I bought ...\r\nMy second Santa Fe, a 2012 -  well worth its weight in gold, and came with a couple new features the '11 did not have. \r\nI searched long and hard and compared economy SUVs, and for the price and warranty, you can't beat this vehicle.  Even used, Hyundai happily replaced a faulty door panel without hesitation.  Excellent Customer serv","152":"as an engineer I can reassure you this vehicle is junk. flimsy build materials inside and out. thin plastic on the inside, thin metal pieces, and doors. 40k miles the vehicle has more rattles then my dead grandma, and the shocks seem to be worn out!! I would NOT reccomend this vehicle.","153":"We bought this suv new over two years ago.\nWe absolutely love it.\nWe have not had a single problem with it.\nOther than the seats being a little hard for me I can't think of a single thing I would like to change.\nSmooth riding, good acceleration and very good gas mileage. \n\nUpdate: The Santa Fe is now 5 years old and runs as well as when it was new.  Have not had a single item go wrong with it.  Very happy with this purchase. Accelerates as well if not better than my 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan which is a 6 cylinder.","154":"Bought used, I have driven it for 4 months and 5000km now. Ride is a little rough, you can feel and hear some little bumps in the road. The fan and AC system sometimes has a mind of its own. It will turn on by itself after I turn it off. Although I'm starting to figure out how to get around it by adjusting the fan speed then hit OFF. \nDriving on highway to merge and stepping on accelerator, sometimes there will be a dead spot on how far you push the accelerator. The car will hesitate or not accelerate as fast as you want to for 2 seconds, then accelerate normally.\nIt is roomy and comfortable inside. The center armrest between driver and passenger sometimes creaks.\nOverall not a bad car.","155":"the sante fe is one big piece of junk. I purchased it new GLS V6 AWD and have had several minor issues with it. The biggest being the AWD DOES NOT WORK! it has a ton of cheap parts inside and out and is just a bunch of junk overall. Me and my parents have owned mercedes, chevys, cadillacs, and fords and this vehicle is one of the worst! HYUNDAI DOES NOT TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR VEHICLES, no matter how good they might look.","156":"We\ndo not like the ride it hits very hard . to me there is simething wrong with the supension.

Seems to hesitate while accellerating. At a stop light,stop sign, or going slow when you press the accelerater the car hesitates and takes a second to finally go. Cannot make any fast decisions. Tried to go into traffice from a stop sign quickly,car hesitated & I almost go into a accident. Makes you drive completely different from the way you normally drive. Does not happen every time,but 2-3 times a day.\nTook car back to the dealer,they test drove,pulled the computer results,said all looks fine. Was told the computer controls the accelerator & it takes a while for the accelerator to go to the computer then back to the accelerator.Trying to unload it","158":" Had this 3.5 Santa fe about 3 months.Love the power the engine has.

We love it.","159":"2012 sante fe GLS AWD V6. the vehicle is just average on everything. it does nothing really \"great.\" hyundai needs to try a little harder on build quality, exterior and interior design. doors and suspension feel tinny. engine is just ok. its not fun to drive BUT, for the money it is a decent small suv.","160":"I have had this car for three months. So far, it has been great. Fun to drive, easy to handle. I have the V6, felt the 4 was short on power during the test drive. Avg 22mpg in the city, around 30 on the hwy. One of the features of this car which they don't push is its short turn radius. I can whip it around like a compact and have gotten some parking places that amaze my riders.","161":"I recently purchased a Santa Fe Limited AWD in Black Forest Green with the beige leather interior.\nIt looks and runs like a dream.\nI considered the Toyota Highlander Limited and the Murano SL with leather, but those cars cost several thousand dollars more, get worse gas mileage, and the Santa Fe is their equal, if not better, in every way-- looks, ride, handling, etc.\n\nWith the V6 it has excellent acceleration, and the electronics-- Bluetooth, satellite radio, HomeLink, etc. all work flawlessly.\nI have been waiting for something to rattle, break or go wrong, but the car is absolutely solid.\nI am very pleased with my purchase, and strongly recommend the Santa Fe.\n","162":"I have had a 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe SE for about six months.\nSo far, I am very pleased with it.\n It is comfotable and fun to drive. It has the 3.5L 6 cylinder engine and it runs good. It is swift.\nIt has lots of pep and that is important to me.\nOn the one short road trip it has been on, it got about 24 mpg.\nIn town it gets between 18 and 20 mpg. It is a very nice vehicle. I would recommend the Santa Fe it to anyone, but I would want the 3.5L engine.","163":"The Santa Fe is a \"cute\" SUV, especially in Red, but it's not very comfortable when it comes to seating.\nThe front seats are hard, the seat itself is too short and the power seat is very hard to adjust to a comfortable position.\nActually the passenger seat is more comfortable than the driver's seat.\n\nThe ride is way too stiff.\n\nWhen the back seat is flipped in the down position it does not lay flat making it hard to haul flat items or even packages.\nThey keep sliding toward the back of the vehicle.\n\n","164":"Just purchased a 2012 Santa Fe two weeks ago.\nThis is my fourth Santa Fe but this time I bought a 4 cylinder instead of a 6 thinking it would save a little more on gas mileage.\nLove everything about the vehicle but the gas mileage.\nI'm getting less with this one than my previous 2008 Santa Fe.\nI was told I would get a couple more miles per gallon but didn't expect to get less.\nIt didn't benefit me like I thought it would to get the 4 cylinder.\nWouldn't recommend a 4 cylinder over a 6 to anyone.","165":"I have owned my 2012 Santa Fe for about 5 weeks now and am absolutely delighted with it.

I'll provide an update soon, but today, this vehicle is 10\/10","129":"Steering System needs repair or software upgrade....","130":"So far, the minor annoyances I can point out are as follows:\n<> Seats are quite firm.\nLong rides can get uncomfortable (disclaimer: I have prior failed back surgery)\n<> I can never find a good position to rest either of my elbows while steering.\nThe window sill to the left is too thin (unless the window is down) and the center console is too low and far away.\nShoulders can get tired on long drives or when stuck in traffic.\n<> Gas mileage is way worse than expected - at least in the city\n<> Leg space design could have been better for taller drivers - I'm just under 6' tall and my left leg stays bent and keeps bumping the door.\n<> The 264 HP are most noticeable at lower speeds (below 40mph)","131":"","132":"","133":"Cons:\nSteering can be improved for all modes but you will get use to it (sport mode is the most responsive), no power liftgate, seat memory selections, or roof rails available with panoramic sunroof","134":"engine power and efficiency, memory seats, accuracy of mpg computercalculation as it is wrong on the high side.","135":"fuel economy, steering fell is terrible..","136":"The stereo system is not the quality that it should be. My 1988 Chevy Cavalier sounder far better than this. Blind spot is pretty bad but wasn't bad enough to sway our decision. Back up camera is standard in so many of these cars it should be included in this car due to how bad the blind spot is. To me, that would be one of the most important safety features but Hyundai made it next to impossible to afford it. You have to buy a $2,450 option package to add the camera. What the heck is that all about????? Standard on both CRV and CX5. Hyundai, touch panels and mini cameras are cheap get with the times. Steering needs to be refined in this electrical system, it does some wandering.","137":"Steering, front window wind noise","138":"Steering can be tighter.\nI got mud flaps added from Hyundai, and you can barely see them.\nI'm not sure what good they'll do.\nThey look good, but I really need them to function.\nThe interior door handles feel flimsy.\nThe Blue Link buttons on the rearview mirror means hitting the buttons often if adjusting for the night mirror.","139":"User seat adjustments and mirror setting upon using your keyless entry.\nthis would allow the fron Drivers seat to go all the way back then forward once you are seated.\nThe Murano had this feature.\nAdjustable head lights for how much load you are hauling would be a nice feature.\nAdjustable cruise control tolerances would be great on any vehicle, I don't know of any that have that feature, but I can't stand it going into the passing gears over a slight slowing down of the vehicle when it gets on a hill. ","140":"As most of you would agree the overall steering needs a bit more refinement.\nMy wife liked the steering in Normal mode and I preferred the Sport mode.\nAfter driving 3000 mile it is a comfortable vehicle and I expect the fuel economy to only get better.\nNOTE - please check your tire pressure ours was delivered with 40 lbs of pressure.\nThe recommended is 33 front and rear.","141":"I brought the car back to the Flemington NJ Hyundai dealer and they said all the 2013 Sante Fe's were doing the same thing, so there was nothing they could do for me.\n\nI called the corporate hotline and filed a case number, but their only solution was to get a second opinion from another dealership.\nI won't put my family in danger by driving this vehicle again until the problem is fixed.\n\nI can only pray at this point that Hyundai will come up with a solution so I'm not stuck with a $30K vehicle I can't drive.\nIt's staying in the garage until then.","142":"The car wanders all over the road.\nThe dealer said everything was okay but replaced the car anyway. Good dealer. The replacement is only marginally better.\nI hope they get it right as I have a four year lease. \n","143":null,"144":null,"145":null,"146":null,"147":null,"148":null,"149":null,"150":null,"151":"The 2012, as well as the 2011, has a couple drawbacks.  Having the 2011 first, I knew the '12 would probably be a somewhat bumpy ride as well.  It isn't as smooth sailing as it could be, and it is noticeable.  The seat bottoms in the bucket seats could be extended out further, unless you have really short legs, the edge of the seat will not be hitting the back of your knees, but fall short.  The head rests are somewhat awkward, even though adjustable, but this is an easy fix using a neck pillow or something, and only noticeable to me on long road trips where the comfort factor is going to be an issue after a few hundred miles.  I never think about it when I'm just driving around town.","152":"hyundai needs to actually try when it comes to building a vehicle. you can dress a [non-permissible content removed] up to make it look good, but underneath its still a piece! thin, cheap parts abound on these vehicles and low resale value.","153":null,"154":"I bought the car knowing gas mileage for this SUV (or any SUV) is not good, so I cannot complain about something I expected. I'm getting 9.7L\/100km on mixed highway\/city driving 50\/50. Was able to get 8.5L\/100km driving all highway on a road trip.\n\nFix the fan automatically on glitch. \nFix hesitation on accelerator pedal.\n\nHaven't had it long enough to test reliability, if anything else comes up I will add to comments.","155":"build quality sucks! awd does not seem to work at all. ","156":"","157":"Fix accelerator.","158":"None","159":"build quality, exterior styling, interior styling, stronger engine.","160":"Could feel more substantial. Feels \"lite\".","161":"None yet.\nV6 gas mileage is right on at 26 highway, but closer to 18-19 in the city versus 20.\nAs the engine breaks in, I imagine it will improve as most seem to do.","162":"The only downside I see is I have somewhat of a difficult time seeing out the rear window. The window is small and the seat head rests obscure my view a ;ittle.","163":"Softer seating with a longer seat cushion.\n\n\nPower liftgate.\n\n\nRear seat that lies flat when in the down position.\n\n\nA little softer ride.\n","164":"","165":"The only reason that I even test drove this vehicle was because it was stated to get 20mpg city which was the minimum that I would consider in looking for a new SUV.\nI am not even getting 17mpg so I am disappointed with this aspect of the vehicle."}}
