my friend's new Edge till I pick him up at the airport . Pros.. nice interior and lay out . NAV is quite good with  large 8' screen,  back up camera  and tech package\/ cross traffic alert  \/ bliss works well. No road or tire noise from inside. , Sony radio and 9 speaker sounds  good but not in the class of other good systems . Ingress \/ egress is excellent with plenty of room for folks over 6' tall. The 2.0L engine lacks low end torque but once you get going there is plenty of power. I would of opt for the V-6 but gas mileage is better with the small turbo. Seating SELmodels non sport seats are so much more comfortable than the Titanium's sport seating . Big \/ tall drivers beware . The Cons ... not many but they are something to consider if buying .  The hood flares up on both sides so when your driving it hard to see \/ judge around turns and corners \/ tight spots . The hood flares up closest to both sides of the driver and passage window . This to me is very annoying . visibility is a little obstructed by window pillars and sloped back window. I'm sure after a few weeks you could get used to it. Last thing that I noticed was the Foot rest by the door where your non driving foot rests. It should of been placed back another 2 inches and slanted more  at a 45 degree angle .  Tall people beware this could be annoying on long trips . Overall comparing it to other Cross Overs the 2017 ford edge is definitely at the top of the pack.","2":"We had a supposed \"this has never happened in the history of Ford\" breakdown.  The high pressure fuel pump stopped working two miles after my wife left the car lot upon final paperwork of buying the vehicle.  The Ford Pass app works on Apple and Android devices.  We own Microsoft phones.  NO ONE at the dealership gave us any information on phone numbers to call for help if the vehicle breaks down.  The only information we had was our salesman's cell phone.  He was the reason why I rated any of this as highly as I did.  He came to our aid, and made sure we got the vehicle towed back to the dealership.  He made sure we had a loaner vehicle for the 18 days we had to wait for the service department to figure out what went wrong, to order the parts, to get an emergency order on a back ordered part, install the four parts needed for this particular pump, and then test drive our brand new vehicle.  It had less than 60 miles on it when it died.  They fixed it. We own it.","3":"I have been looking at all the different SUV's on the road for the past year and decided that I really liked the body style of the Edge.  Once I actually got inside & took it for a test drive there was no going back.  I absolutely love my car. It is above & beyond what I expected.","4":"I had a Mercedes previous to this car.  I thought I was taking a step down in luxury, but it doesn't seem to be that way.","5":"I purchased my Edge 4 months ago.  I compared it with an Acura RD-X (rode rough for my taste), Lexus RX350 (too $$$), and the new Honda CR-V (nice, but a little too small) .  Because of my large amount of driving, I went for the Ecoboost 4 rather than the 6, and it has turned out to be an excellent compromise between power (acceleration) and fuel economy.   I do a long commute, and I appreciate the ease of driving it as well as the mileage of 23-25 mpg in all conditions.  My family of three has taken it from the Bay Area to Tahoe with a full load of luggage, and it had enough performance to handle it comfortably, even through a snowstorm on the way back.   We also own a 2012 Toyota Highlander, and the Edge is far more smooth, quiet, and refined than the Highlander, and gets better mileage as well.  I am over 6', so it is more comfortable as well.  I use Android Auto with the Sony audio system, and the audio system is satisfactory to my non-audiophile hearing.  Would definitely recommend the Titanium 302A package just for the proximity sensors, which aid in backing up.","6":"The Edge Sport is really 2 cars in 1: in everyday driving, it's a well-behaved, reasonably nimble SUV that drives 'smaller' than it really is, due to good handling\/braking. Great people and cargo hauler. We ordered 401A (Tech) pkg, Adaptive Cruise Control and Cargo Accessory pkg. Our 2010 Ford Fusion was an \"almost\" Accord beater--so close, but missed in too many small ways that were irritating. The Edge has corrected all those flaws: precision steering, better braking, much better seats, superior center console design (except for those cupholders; what in the world were they thinking?!?!?). Put it into \"D\" and drive with confidence, right off the bat. MySync 3 is easy to use, even for non-techies. But....slip it into \"S\" for Sport handling, and WOWIE !! Clark Kent vanishes and Superman takes his place! The moment your foot touches the accelerator, however gently, you'll feel the immediate difference. The already good handling tightens up and the car takes off like the proverbial rocket (despite hefty size\/weight). We flung it around tight corners on back country roads for an hour and had to seriously restrain ourselves! It handles so precisely, so cleanly; that after a short time you forget you are tossing almost 5000 lb. of tall high SUV around and not a 3400 lb. low-slung roadster. Mind you, it's not as amazing as the Mondeo suspension used on the old Ford Contour, but we've driven (and owned) several other SUVs and none of them had this kind of flat-out FUN driveability. This is practicality wrapped around a fine driver's car. There are a few minor flaws: the center console cupholders are in a ridiculous place compared to other Ford models (your elbows run into them while driving). Our car, factory ordered (we did not want a moonroof), has a set of auxiliary headlights not working that the service dept. needs to fix. The cargo cover has an overly complicated close\/open design vastly inferior to other mfgs. And.....well, premium gas is recommended, even though it can use regular. But you'll get better performance and (according to some advice from someone who is familiar with Ford turbos) in the long run, better gas mileage as well, by using premium. BTW, far more comfortable than the new Lexus 350, whose seats are now thinner and less cushy. Only real flaws: Dumb cupholder position (should be vertically along passenger side, not horizontal where driver's arm runs into it). Front seat is too high, even at lowest point: are all Ford engineers 6'5\" tall with long legs? Fusion had same issue!","7":"Very easy to drive. No blind spots. Handles very well. Looks awesome. Would definitely recommend the Edge Titanium to anyone. Only wish it had a better sound system in it. I'm used to the quality of Bose, and the Sony is noticeably lacking.","8":"I rented this car for a week and drove it 300 miles in combined highway and city driving.  I own an Acura MDX that is a few years old and have been thinking of buying a new car.  One that I have considered is the Edge.  After driving the Edge Titanium for a week, I find that there are some good and bad aspects to the Edge.  The good is that the car seems well made and has a nicely appointed interior.  Interior controls are easy to learn and to use.  The navi system works well and has a nice large screen.  Performance is OK, but acceleration is not particularly quick. I noticed two things that I really did not like.  One was visibility out of the car to the front and over the hood and the top front quarter when turning.  Compared to the MDX, the hood seems inordinately high and one feels like one is staring out over a very deep dash and long hood from a big, heavy vehicle.  The other aspect of this is that the A pillars seem set back too close to the driving position and they noticeably block vision forward and make it harder to see when turning corners.  One cannot see a curb or lane marker stripes when turning around a corner (like driving into a driveup lane at Starbucks or just turning on a street) and this gives a sense that you cannot tell where you are turning on the road.  The other noticeable thing about the Edge is that it feels ponderously heavy when driving in city traffic.  By that I mean that just moving lane to lane feels like one is moving a much larger, heavier vehicle that this SUV really is.  The Acura, on the other hand has excellent visibility out the front and drives like a car, although it is a larger vehicle than the Edge.  The only way that I can describe it is that it is mega times lighter on its  feet and you can see out of it.  In my opinion, the Edge is a nice overall package, but the limitations I experienced eliminate it from ownership by me.","9":"Decent gas mileage. Visibility and ride comfort are quite good. Handles very well although the turning radius seems quite large. Sensitive, sticky brakes. Averaged 20+ mpg running the vehicle at 70-75 mph for a couple of 1500 mile runs on I-95. Plenty of room for luggage for the 2 of us. Would definitely rent an Edge again.","10":"Only owned 1 month has been in the shop 2 times the headliner had to be replaced for improper installation and rear bumper from a hole cut from factory being to large","11":"We had a 2008 Edge that was traded for this one.  We loved the handling and use of the old one.  This one is superior because of the new improvements in size, styling, navigation, audio, internet, and more we haven't checked out yet.  Only have had it a month.  It is so quiet on the road and smooth.","12":"It was at the top of list for Crossovers I test drove. The following are list of the competitors I also test drove: BMW 1series and 3series, Audio-Q3 and Q5, Lincoln MKC and X, Lexus NX Turbo - it blew away the competition with its turbo charged 300+HP. Fully-loaded it beat all the competition on the price of a lease: zero down and zero due at signing MSRP $46 - $52K with payments of $600 - $700\/mo. @ 20K\/year. Yes you can get any of the above models mentioned in price I mentioned; but Edge Sport was the only one with every option available. When you add more options to the competition you are in the $700 to $800 range. The edge comes with two flaws, the first is front seat suede inserts (the only seats available on this model). You may think it is a nice touch and while you are correct it looks classy, the suede does not allow the driver to move easily in the seat as you cannot slide and therefore finding a comfortable spot can be very difficult and if have a bad back (like I do) it disqualifies itself.  Also the suede picks up lint and may fade over time. The second flaw is a below average audio system.  Some may argue it is high end Sony, but compared to the competition: Revel, Bang and Olufsen, Harmon Kardon and Mark Levinson it pales in comparison. I would much rather spend an extra $1,000 - $2,000 on upgraded audio than a sunroof.  I feel is the sunroof is the biggest waste of money in the car industry today. It usually comes standard on top of line models or in package. It is very misleading, most think you get it for nothing, but it really costs the consumer $1,200 - $2,000; in the Lincoln MKZ it was over $3,000. I have had to pay for one in the last four cars I have owned (they came standard) and used it maybe 3X. I would bet if you asked the buying public if they had $1,000-$2,000 to spend on upgrades or keep in their pockets, they would choose something else or not spend the extra money.  Pro and Cons: Pros: cabin was well insulated, sporty look, fit and finish, plenty of room, horsepower best in class, technology. Cons: ride a bit rough due to 20\" tires, suede inserts on front seat (only option), audio system, gas mileage.","13":"I had a VW TDI and knew VW was going to be buying my VW back so I had many months to shop for the perfect car for me.  I test drove them all numerous times and each time I came back to the Ford Edge.  I wanted a vehicle that was sturdy on the road, solid when you closed the door and quite on the road....and it needed to have plenty of power.  That is what the Ford Edge gave me!  Because this care was so smooth on the road and luxurious inside, I decided to go with a black color since it made me feel like I was riding in a sedan made to drive a world leader.  I look forward to driving this car everyday!","14":"My Edge has over 7,000 miles now and I'm very happy with my purchase.  Very smooth ride, good acceleration with nice features.  Its a perfect size with room for people and cargo yet we've been getting 25 to 27 combined mpg.","15":"Have only owned the car for 3 weeks, so still figuring everything out.","16":"I've been driving Ford products for 35 years by far this is the worst car I've own. fuel economy is terrible, handling is not at all good. Seems as if ford took 10 giant steps backward on the edge. Visibility  at the A and B pillars is also an issue causing a huge blind spot. This is not a car I would recommend to anyone. Wishing I would have done more research before purchasing this car. What a waste of money. The whole dealership experience at Bob Rohman Ford Schaumburg Il was a joke. Customer support after was non existence.","17":"Headlights fog and taillights Ford says its normal ? Dont think so.....Its in shop now getting the dash torn out to replace a faulty evap box the car is comfy to drive but unreliable for the money thus far.","18":"I traded in a 2015 Mercedes GLA 4Matic due to its small size and difficulty getting in and out. My partner and I are each 6'1\" and the MB just felt cramped after a while. If we had to take someone with us? Oh forget it. The back seat had almost no space. It wasn't a problem when I bought it, but over time, I got tired of making excuses for the thing. Final straw was a trip we made over a couple dates. Not terrible, but after a week in the car with all of our stuff, we just got tired of playing Tetris to get everything to fit. The Ford Edge was a revelation. Great space, not huge, but big enough. Easy to get in and out of, no excuses taking passengers in back. The only issue I have is with the Sync 3 system. The owner.ford.com site says you can update the software to the latest version and has a downloadable update. Well, I've been trying for a week, and it still hasn't \"taken.\" Also, the USB keeps showing it's updating the software, but will just pop up a message that the USB was removed and needs to be plugged back in. Hadn't taken it out, but after removing and reinserting, I still get the same issue. I've got Ford on it, but it's a frustration. Overall though, the car is great. The 2015 update was what made me look at the car, but Sync 3 with Apple CarPlay is what ultimately made me leap.","19":"If you live in an Urban area with a lot of stop-and-go traffic, be aware that your mpg will be LOW! I live in central LA and when most errands are less than 5 miles in a local traffic, I'm averaging 12-14 mpg. On an early Sunday morning where the road is relatively empty i can get 18 mpg.","20":"I brought the sel model with a 6 cylinder engine....makes all the difference in the world ...well worth the additional cost. The dealer had sun roof installed, works great, looks factory installed. totally pleased with this vehicle...color combination makes a difference....love it!!!!!!","21":"I bought the car not even a year ago. I bought it for the great gas mileage. It only gets 14 miles to the gallon and the dealership says it's normal. NOT!!!  My mustang got the correct gas mileage right off the lot and so does the brand new fusion that i have been driving for the last week. Ford sold me a lemon and I would not recommend this car to anyone!!! Spend your money elsewhere.","22":"Have a few issues but Ford is working on them.  Dealership is doing everything they can.  Hopefully will be resolved soon.\n\nUpdated:  Bought the Edge on February 12, 2016.  Had it back to the dealer several times within a year.  Turn signals don't always click.  Had to be towed to the dealer for a new battery at 6 months.  A couple of months later, all the lights relating to the braking system came on and all the alarms for them went off.  Had to turn it off and restart to make it quit.  In February of 2017, the air conditioner came back on 3 times after turning it off.  Contacted Ford.  They won't do ANYTHING about it...it's \"over a year old\".   First and LAST Ford for me!!","23":"rear door sensor not easy to use","24":"The only drawback to giving it all 5 stars across the board are the tires. These Hankook 19\" P245 55 R19 flat out suck (F-). I have the optional 3.5 V6 engine and while not as thrifty as the Ecoboost, I live in a very hilly area and need pulling power.","25":"I traded my 07 Edge in on a new 2016. The Titanium trim is great approaching that of a Lincoln. The best thing is the 2.0 Ecoburst engine. I am getting 23 mpg in the city ! My 07 Edge got 17 mpg is the exact same conditions. Surprisingly enough the rear cargo area is almost 6 inches longer than my old Edge. I was hoping to use my old cargo mat and it no longer fit. I find the Ford Sync 3 disappointing. I was told that it would get updated to the newest version that supports Android Auto and Apple Carply by the summer of 16. Here I am in Jan 17 with no update. My dealer says he can \"force\" it to take apps but that seems mickey mouse and would prefer the update which is out in the 2017 models. I can't express how disappointed I am in Ford for this lack of support.\n\nUPDATE 7\/13\/2017  It is astounding that Ford has not updated my Sync 3 to the newer version that has Android Auto ! Ford has abandoned it's customers and moved on to new models. Not only that but Sync 3 does crazy things like the radio turns on when I turn the car off even if I wan't using the radio in the first place. I would not buy another Ford with any kind of Tech.","26":"so far, my only complaint w\/ the car is the location of the cup holders in the front console.  They should be in front of the gear stick, not behind - as it is now, it is difficult to grab your water bottle.\n\n6 mos. later:  does not seem to be getting good gas mileage however, I have not checked the mileage.  Still love the car - except for the cup holders!","27":"I was forced to buy a new car after my old one was totaled in an accident. I hate car shopping so I wasn't over thrilled to do it. Thanks to Edmunds car buying service and Phil Long Ford it was easy. I love the Ford Edge SEL. I handles like a dream and is easy to get in and out of. A plus was getting my 89 year father in and out plus there is a power port right next to the passenger seat for his oxygen machine. Love it.","28":"All well except a lot of wind noise at highway speeds, a clicking noise somewhere while driving.","29":"Very comfortable and very quiet ride.  The 2.0 turbo engine is completely adequate for acceleration needs.  The vehicle gives a smooth ride.  The braking is excellent and the steering is tight.  I don't like getting in and out of the front since I have to duck or bang my head on the opening(I am an average sized man so tall people will suffer more).  My dealership has been poor in follow up support.  However, the vehicle thus far hasn't needed anything more than an oil change.  So far, so good.  Decent ride.","30":"This SUV pairs premium features with the speed and handling of a sports car. I could not be happier with this family SUV (with a hidden wild side)!","31":"Owned this car for nine months and 5000 miles.  2.0 turbo is an awesome engine.  Not once have i stepped on the gas and wished for more power.  It moves really well and pretty silent at that.  This has to be one of the quietest vehicles I've owned.  Ride is nice and absorbs the road well.  Fit and finish is first class.  Panoramic sun roof is nice as well as the sound system and technology.   Much better than my Infinity that i traded for this car.  Very intuitive and easy to figure out.  Ford has done a great job with this car front to back its a winner.","32":"I am 5 .7 and 200 pounds  and I  HATE the drivers seat  never buy a ford again  ps this was my 4 ford","33":"I have never had this issue with a car before.  I loved my last Edge and my other vehicle is a Ford F150 which I love.  The 2016 Ford Edge Titanium has a vibration to it that sounds like buffeting from having the rear windows open.  If I ride in this car for more than 30 minutes I get a nasty headache.  This is the worst car I ever owned.","34":"This is my forth Edge so I guess I like them.  There is one thing on my new 2016 Edge that I could do with out and I find it DANGEROUS.  The model I have has the new kick under the rear bumper to open the tail gate.  If you step in to far to get something and your foot hits the sensor it comes down on your head. This has happened many times.  I was taking fishing rods out of the back and stepped in for a better grip and the tailgate came down.  I had to move fast so they did not get broken.  I asked the dealer to disconnect it and was told you can't.  After owning 4 Edges I was hoping they would put some rear bumper protection on top of the rear bumper to protect it from taking things in and out.","35":"Love this vehicle.  So great to drive.  The style, comfort and overall cost is perfect match.  Was a little disappointed in the gas mileage at first, but now averaging about 28\/gal on highway.","36":"I have owned the 2016 Ford Edge SEL 2WD for about three months, traded in a 1999 Ford Explorer so modern technology like this a first for me.  I can not speak for reliability because it is too new.  I have taken the Edge on two trips from Florida to Pennsylvania and coast to coast in Florida.  All trips were straight through, 17 hours of driving each way.  My review is mostly negative as I expected much more thought put into design for the money you spend.  The driver seat is very comfortable, never had an ache (drove straight thru to PA both times).  The interior overall is nice, no complaints on material except headliner color choices.  Vehicle very quiet with windows up.  Windows down...very noisy.  The steering wheel is either too small or door armrests too narrow.  I like to drive with left arm resting on armrest and holding the wheel, can't do that in the Edge.  Steering wheel controls need a bump or each shaped differently.  I have to continuously look at them when using as I cannot tell which my finger is on, they are all shaped the same and feel the same.  I do not like the feel of the steering, my arm actually gets fatigued.  Guess I prefer the \"Cadillac\" feel, nice and easy.  The one touch window is a bear to just open a crack.  The radio and climate controls straight forward and easy to use with the exception of the steering wheel tuning.  It scrolls through just the current favorite channels.  In other words, you can program so many stations on channel one, channel two and channel three but can only scroll stations on channel one if that is the one radio is on.  You cannot scroll all channels, have to select channel two on radio to then scroll those.  My Chevy you can scroll all by using steering wheel controls, very nice feature.  Navigation...where do I start with this.  Was VERY excited to have this feature, first ever for us.  Well, it has gotten me lost three times and my house\/street are not even listed...can not find.  I live in an established neighborhood built in 2001 yet my street is not listed.  The street leading to mine is and you can see my street on map but it is not named.  I have found this with several places I have traveled, streets not listed and yes, my settings are correct under options.  I was told if it ever gets updated I would have to purchase update, it is not free.  The other part I do not like is the vehicle has to be stopped to search a destination by typing.  It's ok to scroll through everything on the radio, settings, station search, look for restaurants, etc. while driving but cannot type an address.  I have settings set to take fastest route and on a trip in FL, it mapped the long way home, not the quickest.  Very poor navigation system, we use our smart phones to verify before we trust it.  Last I'll speak on the engine.  I have the 2.0 I-4 turbo, wish I went with the six cylinder.  There is a very distinct hesitation in the engine which I did not notice when test driving.  If you are pulling out in heavy traffic or going to pass, hang onto your heart because it takes about 1 second after mashing the accelerator before she goes.  Very scary finding that out the hard way!  Took it to the Ford garage and they said it was turbo lag and nothing can be done.  Also find the engine noisy and hear tapping constantly.  And speaking of noise, the radiator fan extremely loud.  I'll end on a good note which was the main thing I was looking for, love the cargo space in back...","37":"Edmunds drop-down menu does not allow me to select the exact vehicle I bought, which is a Ford Edge SUV, Titanium, AWD, naturally aspirated V6. - I opted for the 201a package as I did not want the lane assist (i.e., a friendly nudge when one changes lanes without using the turn signal; who needs that?). This is the nicest vehicle I have ever owned. The engineers at Ford really thought of everything. Every detail is just perfect. Air conditioned front seats (three levels of a\/c). Front and rear heated seats. Synch-3 interface could not be easier to use and the graphics are easy to see and beautiful. The Sony stereo will rattle the neighborhood (but I don't do that, I'm a normal person). The acceleration is fantastic. Placing you foot under the bumper lifts the automatic lift-gate, which is also height-adjustable. There are three memory settings for different drivers to select from for the power-driver's seat (with a button to choose 1,2, or 3). Also a power passenger seat. Ceramic perforated leather is extra comfy and breaths easy. Adjustable lumbar support and adjustable head rest. Ergonomic layout of the dash and interior is superior to any other vehicle I've ever been in. Height of vehicle makes it easy to navigate through traffic. You will notice the quality of the vehicle build is superior from the first time you drive the car. The 19-inch tires contribute to some slightly noticeable cabin noise, but it is not enough to complain about. The Vista-roof is awesome and easy to adjust to the position you desire. You can adjust the color of the LED displays via the Synch-3 interface (the door sill has an LED \"Edge\" display which can be adjusted to the color you want, etc.). Plenty of room in the cargo area and rear seats. I got rid of the factory carpet floor mats and bought some WeatherTech all-weather mats (which fit perfectly). The car came from the factory with a nice rubber floor mat for the cargo area. The car is beautiful and the ride is superior. One review I read dinged the Ford Edge and recommended some Korean-made Kia...  bwaaahahaha. [non-permissible content removed]. I'd rather have my Ford Edge (and save $20,000+) than any luxury SUV. I did lots of research and compared the Edge to similar vehicles from Toyota, Honda, GMC \/ Chevy, Subaru and Jeep and selected the Edge and am extremely confident that I made the right choice. The engineers at Ford really did their homework. Great job.","38":"I don't use words like great and awesome very often when describing  cars. However, these words describe my 2016 Ford Edge Titanium. At least so far. My wife and I are in our 60's and we decided to trade our larger Explorer for something smaller that was easy to drive around town, parking lots, and shopping centers. We wanted the SUV to look great both inside and out with plenty of technology and still maintain the internal room we needed. We did not need a third row seat. We looked at the Nissan Morano, Chevy Equinox, and Jeep Grand Cherokee.  After driving the Edge my wife said this is the SUV for us.. We purchased the 302A package which gives us an abundance of safety features and upgrades. Sync 3 is so much easier to use. The touch screen is easy to see and navigate through and the voice commands have a much quicker response. The Edge is very easy to drive with an upscale looking and comfortable interior and a great design on the outside. MPG has been around 20 primarily around town with the 2.0 liter Ecoboost fwd engine and 20 inch wheels. The acceleration and power are very smooth and adequate for what we need on a daily basis..If you are looking for a Mid-Size Crossover I would highly recommend test driving the new Edge.","39":"I just finished a six day rental of a '16 Ford Edge Titanium with the Ecoboost 2.0 4 engine, driving it from south Florida to northern Georgia (mountains), down through the west Georgia boonies where The Walking Dead is filmed, then back south.  It averaged 28 - 29 mpg on the open (highway\/interstate) road, 22 mpg in town per the fuel economy computer.  Not bad - gas mileage is better than a 2013 Toyota Highlander that I drove for awhile.  \n \nThe performance of the Ecoboost 4 engine is pretty impressive, considering the weight of the Edge (4000+ lbs) vs the small size of the 2.0 liter engine, and it does move it along pretty well. However, if you've carrying a load of people & luggage in a hilly area, you\u2019ll sometimes wish you had another 15 ponies and 20 pound\/feet of torque on tap.  With a full load, this engine in this vehicle gets the job done, but you won\u2019t have a lot of reserve power to spare. \n \nTo be fair, compared to the POS '14 Ford Edge rental I drove two years ago that had a brutally punishing and miserable ride, the '16 Edge is a big overall improvement from their new Sync 3 system (great!) to the relatively improved ride, seat comfort, braking and handling.  It was very strange, however, that this loaded Titanium didn\u2019t have a navigation system!!!!  Nearly a $37k MSRP car??? Huh???\n \nThis being said\u2026 this \u201916 Titanium didn't close the deal for my family for a purchase, and here\u2019s why:\n \nIt rode pretty smoothly and fairly quietly only on the most glass-like asphalt road.  I don\u2019t know where some Edmunds reviewers say that this SUV is soooo \u2018quiet\u201d \u2013 it is NOT, and on some types of macadam and asphalt roads, the road noise is surprisingly LOUD. Obviously, these reviewers must be deaf, happy Ford fanatics, or previously drove Yugos or 1950 Ford pickups. \n\nOn any other road surface than smooth asphalt, the ride was frequently nervous and bumpy on all but the smoothest of surfaces. The car thumped and bumped over minor broken pavement, you felt every imperfection in the road through the steering wheel and your seat. \n \nThe road noise from the 19\u201d Hankook 245\/55R19 Venus S1 noble tires (set at 35psi per the manufacturer's recommendation) and through the vehicle\u2019s floorpan was a bit excessive, especially since this was the Titanium model.  I shudder to think how the Edge Sport must ride and sound with it's even lower profile tires\/larger (20\") wheels. \n \nFrankly, we were surprised and a bit shocked at this after reading all of the glowing reports from Edmunds reviewers about the \"smooth ride\" on this new Edge.  Ummmmmm, NO.  Maybe these people think that a SUV\/crossover HAS to ride stiffly and with pronounced road noise.  No, they do NOT have to be this way.\n \nFor these reasons, these observations were definitely NOT my definition of a \u2018Titanium\u2019 level in my opinion, and the probable deal breaker for a potential purchase. \n \nWith the improvements in automotive industry suspension and sound reduction technology introduced over the past few years, there is certainly no excuse for Ford not producing a smoother riding and quieter crossover than this new top of the line Edge.  Perhaps the Edge SEL might ride a little better (and a little quieter) with it's 18\u201d wheels & tires (I recently learned that you CAN order an Edge Titanium w\/18\" wheels & tires). If so, a \u201816 Edge SEL could be worth a serious look if you're looking for a quieter and smoother ride.\n \nIn the meantime, I suggest that Ford needs to talk to Kia, and closely examine a '16 Sorento.  I rented a lowly '16 Sorento LX w\/V6 a few months ago, and it was  definitely a quieter, smoother riding, and faster (V6) SUV than this '16 Edge Titanium, and at a MUCH lower price.  Don't take MY word for it - rent one from Avis or Enterprise for a few days like I did, and wring it out.  If you own a new Edge, you may be a bit upset after driving one of these SUVs.\n\nBTW, the '16 Sorentos in EX & SXL trim are even quieter, more comfortable, and ride about as well as their lower trim LX, despite having 19\" or 20\" wheels & tires!!!\n \nOverall, the new Edge is a bit of a disappointment for a SUV we really wanted to like.  Back to the drawing board, Ford \u2013 Kia can get the job done with their Sorento, so, you can too.  Try again!!\n \n<br><br><br><br>","40":"It has pretty much everything we needed. The only thing that i regret not including is a front camera. Great ecoboost, pretty good on gas millage.","41":"So far I am very happy with my Ford Edge. Another coworker bought one the week before me and we've both noted that they are very zippy. The Edge has the power to take off right away which is helpful getting into traffic and is very smooth. The steering wheel feels good and everything seems to be in a place that makes sense. The hands-free technology is great with the bluetooth connection to your phone. You can make calls\/receive calls and hear texts without being distracted. The lane assist is helpful and there are so many camera and distance auto-detect features that if you get into an accident it will be your fault not the car's. The distance auto-detection is helpful when pulling into tight spaces like a packed 2-car garage. The quality of the interior is excellent. I think the Ford technology package is better than the Acura's where the user interface is blocky. The kids love the feature to swing their leg under the back to get the cargo hatch to open. My only minor materials issue is some of the plastic edging on the rear door feels sharp and could be smoothed a bit. The heated\/cooled seats and climate control is great. Both of my large dogs fit into the cargo area so they never have to sit in the back seat. I felt that I got just a good of a vehicle as the Acura MDX without the cost.","42":"Front seat heaters and coolers. Back seats recline with seat heaters too!","43":"Look at the various packages before you buy.  Combining them the right way can give you substantial savings.","44":"I bought my 2016 Edge SEL last month.  I elected to get the 3.5L V6 and really enjoy the acceleration it offers.  I'm still on my second tank of gas and I am getting 21.7 MPG in  a mostly rural setting. I haven't had the car out on the highway yet.  The ride is good and the drivers seat is quite comfortable.  Visibility is good except for the back right side- there is  a large blind spot there.  The stereo is average;  I got sync3 and found it easy to use.  I'm not crazy about the voice activated commands so I probably won't use them too much.  The all season floor mats are a joke.  Save your money and buy WeatherTech mats! Option I wish I had-the 2.7L ecoboost!  I didn't want to spring the extra cash for the sport version.","45":"I shopped for a few SUV's, tested Escape and Honda CRV and both were too small for me. Then I tested the Ford Edge Titanium with all the options and it felt the perfect size for me. I even started out wanting the V-6 engine and tested both the V-6 and 4 cylinder EcoBoost and decided on the EcoBoost because the power was there and the MPG was higher than the V-6. The EcoBoost engine is so quite and has great power so I decided to go with that plus its the standard engine and the V-6 is a option over $600.00. I bought the Titanium Model with the Tech Package and 20 inch Wheel upgrade package and it has the new Sync 3 which is great. I think if you are looking at a Mid Size SUV you need to look and drive a Ford Edge.","46":"The Ford Edge Titanium 2.0 Eco boost is amazing! Great acceleration and roomy interior. I have been a Honda girl for 32 years. I drove the CR-V and was disappointed in the lack of acceleration and road noise. The Honda Pilot was just too large for my needs. So I started my research and realized the Ford Edge was in the top 10 best SUVs in Consumer Reports. The other high ranking SUVs were very nice but larger than what I needed. The Ford Edge has a potential of reaching 30MPG which also played a role in what I wanted in my SUV. The redesigned body and interior is very classy and as nice as the high end SUVs! Plenty of leg room and good cargo space. Cabin is pretty quiet. Visibility is great!  AC is cold  with good fan speed options , and it has vents for the back seats as well. I paid extra for the panoramic sun roof as in my previous vehicles, I used my sun roof as often as the weather would allow. I love it!  You will not be disappointed if your purchase the Ford Edge! Ford has done a fabulous job bringing this vehicle to the top 10 SUVs!","47":"Big difference in Basic Model vs SEL on Tech Package and 4 vs 6 cyl  engine","48":"I recently purchased an AWD SE from my wife.  I got to say that the overall value of the car is excellent.  It rides like a much more expensive vehicle.  There's plenty of room to seat five, and the interior of the vehicle Has high grade materials.  I do wish that the SE model had the sync three interactive infotainment system.  The 2.0 turbo seems to be plenty powerful enough to pass in highway traffic.  The Michelin tires are decent.  A bit underwhelming in weather.  There is plenty of cargo space.  I love the overall look of the vehicle and the led lights that complement the rear of the vehicle.  I find it to be a great value in the middle d size suv segment.","49":"I love this car and I'm not even a car person!","50":"I actually test drove the Porsche, Audi, BMW, Lexus and Audi analogues to the Ford Edge Sport.  Saved not less than $15,000 (and more like $25,000 for comparably equipped) and the Edge is every bit as much the 'driver's car'.  Steering is a little on the light side but extremely responsive. Acceleration is very strong (coming from a current Mustang GT Boss owner and a former Audi S4 owner).  Brakes are solid and while I haven't beaten them up too much, they don't seem to fade even under hard use.\n\nFit and finish is generally very good but not quite up to the Lexus or Audi standards.  Unless you walk around the car with a ruler though, you probably won't notice any real hiccups.  We  bought a  completely decked out model so it has pretty much every bell and whistle.  All seem to work well but you'll need to spend some quality time with either the user manual or your dealership to figure it all out.  The major control are straightforward and can be controlled by either real buttons or the touchscreen.  I highly recommend the adaptive cruise control. It's a little freaky at first but not having to constantly jigger your speed is a very pleasant experience.\n\nMy only negative, and it's not a big one, is that we sprung for the 21 inch wheels. They look great but I'm not excited about the Pirelli Scorpion tires. They are a little on the noisy side and I'm not super confident with their wet traction (then again, I live in Arizona so not a big issue here).  If I were to do it over again, I'd stick with the 20\" wheels and thus protect my rims from curbs.\n\nOverall, unless the reliability becomes an issue, I don't think you can go wrong with this car.","51":"The car's gas performance is less than advertised.  The battery is inadequate. Otherwise it's a great little car","52":"I have had my 2016 Edge SEL 2.0 for a few weeks so I don't have a full review yet. I had test drove the V6 but bought it with the 2.0 4cyl. I was concerned about engine vibration on a 4 cylinder but its not a problem and the car rides quietly and shifts smoothly. For normal driving the 2.0 is more than adequate and I came out of a V6 Murano.   \nI want to correct Edmunds stats. The fuel recommendations for the 2.0 is regular fuel not below 87 octane as per the users manual, premium is not needed.","53":"Ford has improved the touch screen from previous years model. Really great little car. Smooth and quiet on the highway and easy to maneuver in the city. Not crazy about the limited direction of the front a\/c vents in the center, but not a huge deal. Lots of leg room and head room for taller people. Has a really solid feel to it. Overall very happy with this purchase.","54":"Based on my test drive, I knew this was the vehicle for me.  A very quiet and smooth ride.","55":"We looked at a variety of smaller SUV's... downsizing from an 11 year old Tahoe Z71.  We waited for the Ford Edge 2016 to gain the Sync 3 and Drivers Assist package.  The Sync 3 is very easy to navigate.  My son has a 2015 Explorer Sport with the Ford Touch and it's not near as user friendly.\nI must admit it was a bit unnerving the first time I started to change lanes on the freeway WITHOUT turning on my turn signal and then have the steering nudge me back into my own lane.  Now I remember to use the signal. LOL.\nThe Edge is an extremely quiet ride and the interior is nicely appointed with soft surfaces everywhere.  We got a Pearl White Titanium AWD with all the options with the Ceramic interior.\nWe special ordered the Edge and it was well worth the wait.\nUpdate: We had a \"common\" problem with the new \"Adaptive Steering\". It was a pain... dealer or Ford initially couldn't figure it out.  Once they did... no problems.  Been over a year abd 10,000 miles and it is still fum to drive.","56":"A great car. The best visibility on screen. But I did not feel comfortable since I could not see my front since the car is so high and the hood design reduces visibility.","57":"This crossover feels more expensive than it was. Leather interior is top notch, large comfortable seats all around. The new sync 3 system is very intuitive and easy to use, navigation works like a charm. 4cyl engine is sufficient enough this a family car not a race car folks. Handles well and we are really enjoying this vehicle.....highly recommend it.","58":"I purposely shopped for a car without the $3000 added navigation. I use the WAZE app for free and it is more useful. This car is a rocket ship, very responsive, quiet and the moon roof is huge. First 1000 miles loving it...","59":"We bought this 2 year old 2015 Edge with only 7,500 miles on it so it was basically brand new.  Really have enjoyed it!  I went from a '08 Camry to this so it's really nice having the higher ride\/visability and additional room.  Back seats recline so riders enjoy that feature.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for an SUV that's easy to get around it, but has plenty of room.","60":"I have had my Ford Edge for less than 2 years, 17months to the day that my transmission went out on it, I bought it brand new sometimes I drive 1,0000 miles a week,  all highway miles, but I usually get rid of vehicles around 75,000 to stay away from big problems. So 17 months new,  and I'm driving down the road and the transmission starts spinning .. my transmission completely broke at 60,979 miles so as you may know 3 yr \/60,000  mile warranty didn't cover it since it was 979 miles out of the warranty, it was gone for 1 month at the Ford garage they ended up rebuilding it finally just now got it back, and I hate that I just spent 3,500+ with a rental car another 1,000 + a monthly payment of 665.00 when I don't have it for the whole month it was gone for 29 days :( I would have never imagined a transmission would go out at 60,000 miles being that there is no  Service to the transmission due to 150,000 miles .I argued with them saying it was their fault my  stock tires should never outlast a transmission. I guess I'm just really disappointed this is why I always buy new cars so bad things don't happen to them the lady at the dealership pretty much told me I should've bought the extended warranty, so if you didn't think I was mad enough when she said that you can imagine how po'd I was.I have never kept vehicles over 75,000 miles because the small stuff starts happening but apparently with this something huge happened at 60,979 miles. Just really disappointed with the whole situation.","61":"Bought this car in 2015. 9 months later it lost power while I was driving. Brought it in for service where they kept it for 3 weeks and Ford sent it back with a rebuilt transmission. 2 days later the car broke down again. The tech forgot to put the gasket on and transmission liquid poured out. April 2017 the car lost power once again while I was driving, which was a very scary and dangerous situation. Sent car in and for the second time it was the transmission that needed replacements. The first  time I had a problem I asked for a new transmission not a rebuilt one or for the car to be replaced, being that it was not even one year old. They would not comply. I do not feel comfortable driving this car. Ford refused to accept responsibility and to stand behind their product. I asked for the car to be bought back for a trade in and they gave me the same trade in value other dealers would give me for the car. The manager at the dealer also priced out a Ford Explorer at sticker for a trade in. They are not trying to make a very wrong situation right.  To be honest I know longer trust a Ford car or Ford corporation.  Think it through well before becoming a victim of Ford.","62":"I had this car for over a year now. I drive 50-60 MPH on Michigan flat country road no Traffic & no Signals. I get an average of 22.0 MPG. I can't understand how other companies got in trouble for cheating on their MPG and Ford can get away with it, Sticker shows 20-28 MPG well they got the first number right. The rear doors don't line up with rear fenders both sides. I had a 2014 ford Fusion Hybrid before this one and the MPG sticker shows 47-47-47 MPG combined, I was lucky to get 40 MPG. So why on earth they make a 4 Cyl. engine with ECO Boost that gets such a low MPG. I have a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander with 6 Cyl. 3.0L engine, 135,000 miles, & better towing capacity and gets a little better MPG than this one. I think Ford should be honest on their MPG or  should be penalized like other foreign car companies who cheats on their MPG.","63":"This SUV is amazing! Beautiful interior, sleek exterior! I have 10,000mi on my edge, and my husband loves it too! He begs me to use it, because it's easy to park and get into tight spaces! Great car for long distance trips. Feels heavy on the road where most in this class feel cheap or dinky! I drove the range of them before deciding on this vehicle! I drove the BMW, Lexus, Range Rover, Toyota, GMC all in this class. Loved the fords safety features, and comfort not just in the drivers seat but in passenger and backseat!","64":"I love this car!","65":"We looked at a few SUV's before buying the Edge, Including the Buick Encore, GMC Terrain, Kia Sportage and Sorrento, Chevy Equinox and Ford Escape.  The best by far was the Edge.  Most room, comfort and performance at a good price.  The 2.0L Turbo 4 cylinder out performs all of the others except the Escape including the Terrain's V6 that we tried because its 4 cylinder was so bad.  Very happy with the purchase so far.\nSync system is a problem.  Keeps loosing our smart phone connectivity and won't accept input from my Ipod. Dealers service tech told me my phone is bad and Sync has trouble communicating with Apple products.   USB port is in an inaccessible spot making it very difficult to reach.","66":"I have driven over the Edge over 26,000 miles on highways, gravel roads, dirt roads, through snow, on ice, and through heavy rain. It has handled awesome. I have taken it on long trips and you know how tired you are after driving long hours. This is the only vehicle I have driven a long distance that I can say I was not tired at the end. The seats are so comfortable and supportive it is amazing! The Edge handles very smoothly when driving, changing lanes, on turns, and through curves. I can honestly say that the blind side protection has saved me from several accidents. That is the safety feature you must get! The Edge has been extremely reliable only requiring oil changes and tire rotations. The service from my Ford dealer has been excellent! There are only two things I suggest for improvement. The navigation interface needs a slight software change to make it easier to set the destination. It requires an extra step to confirm after you have already entered all the information. The other thing to note is that the standard mats are only OK. The all-weather mats are great. Get them including one for the rear hatch area. When I travel, I frequently have my sons that are 6 feet 4 inches and 6 feet 2 inches with me along with some of their large friends. They all have plenty of room in the front and back. To sum it up, Ford has done an amazing job with this vehicle. If you are in the market for an SUV\/Crossover and only require two rows of seats, I highly recommend the Ford Edge.","67":"After 30 years of Jeep Grand Cherokees, I switched to an Edge Titanium for price reasons.  Very satisfied with the 2.0 L Eco-Boost turbo-charged engine; some typical turbo lag, but not a problem.  Consistent mixed use mileage of 21-23 mpg.  Ground clearance is less than Jeep and there is no selectable low range  gear, however neither has been a problem so far; my concern was my long steep snow covered driveway.  Good handling and crisp steering control.  Overall a very good vehicle, and I am completely satisfied with the purchase decision.  We think it's a great vehicle.\n\nOriginal tires were unacceptable for uphill use in snow, replaced with snow tires now OK.","68":"engine, trans and traction from awd turbo is excellent and looks great, i dont need anything more","69":"After one full year driving the new ford edge with no complaints other than a constant water condensation problem in the rear led tailights usually after it rains or the vehicle goes thru a car wash. Ford has agreed to replace only the center taillight at this time . Other than the above described  the car has been a pleasure to drive and handles well in all weather conditions and has been a reliable vehicle so far .","70":"Bought the Edge after looking at Escapes and wanted more space.  We were coming from a Compass, so this is a huge upgrade.  The SEL leather interior is very nice and the overall space in the vehicle is perfect for a growing family.  The styling is great and the technology features are great.  We bought the 3.5L V6 after driving the 2.0 EcoBoost because of its increased performance and towing capabilities.  Overall it is a great vehicle and I definitely recommend for this price range.","71":"I so loved this car until it died on my commute home.  Luckily, I was only on a 2 lane highway and not the major Atlanta highway I had just exited from.  13,000 miles and it just lost power.  I thought I had gotten some bad gas as we were in the middle of gas shortages in Georgia.  Called road side assistance and had to have it towed back to the dealership.  The next morning the service department called me first thing and the gentlemen I spoke with seemed to not think it was bad gas - looking back now I am pretty convinced he knew EXACTLY what the problem was due to the propensity of fords to have this issue.  I was later told by my salesman that there was a recall with this issue.  I looked this up and there are no recalls on this car at all.  Ford needs to own up to this issue.  Except for this very major break-down, I had been very pleased with this car.  It does drive very nicely and while not perfect, Sync does pretty much what I tell it to do.  I do need to give a shout- out to Akins Ford in Winder, Georgia because they do bend over backwards to make things right.  Now Ford needs to do what is right.","72":"We purchased this 2015 Ford Sport Edge then end of last year. We have always been loyal Ford owners - this vehicle will make it the LAST FORD we ever buy. The new styling is great - but the cost for the options within the vehicle are terrible. The vehicle's turn radius is the worst SUV turn radius we have ever seen. The on-screen technology is the worse of any out there, it will not respond to my voice at all and it takes several screens to get through to do one simple item on any other vehicle with on-screen technology. Comfort level of the front seats takes a long time to set up the correct position for anyone to be comfortable - and if you are tall, you will never find a comfortable adjustment to the seat and driving distances is painful. When you start up this vehicle - there is a metal on metal grinding sound (not good), we have taken this vehicle in numberous times to the dealership and their response is \"that's the way they make this vehicle.\" Something is grinding metal on metal and that is not good - something is wrong and they will not look into it further and\/or fix it. POOR follow through and service by both the dealership & Ford Motor Company (whom we notified of the problem also). For the price - this SUV should work right, the technology should work properly & be easy to use (like other comparable and even less comparable SUV\/vehicles). The turn radius should be much better - our full sized RAM truck can turn tighter than this small SUV. The metal on metal grinding - is a serious problem and no one will inspect it to fix that problem. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this vehicle and Ford Motor Company. Price is too high for such problems on a new SUV and the poor service\/follow through from the dealership\/Ford Motor Company - is in no means \"user friendly.\" My husband HATES this vehicle and he has always had Fords and purchased Ford trucks\/vehicles for his company...that no longer will be the case. There are MUCH BETTER options for a SUV out there at this price - please look into other options, you will be much more satisfied. Shame on you Ford for not standing my a quality product and customer service, major let down.","73":"It's a great car","74":"Great car. Feels really tight and safe when driving.","75":"I set out to buy a 2016 Titanium model but through the process and researching information decided to buy a 2015 Sport model. There were only very minor changes from 2015 to 2016 and I saved a TON of money and was able to get a fully loaded model. My primary goal was safety features and I got lots of them! See the 402A package for details.   It has been great so far except gas mileage being low but I feel safe, I feel the power of the ecoboost, I feel comfortable, and I feel I made a great choice!","76":"We struggled a few days in deciding on the 4 vs v6.   Within a few months it will be one year in having chosen the 4 cyl. and we are very pleased with the performance. It is still difficult to believe how torquey the 4 responds, and how effortless it carries the weight of a vehicle this size.   The by-monthly drives from Michigan to Chicago in midwest weather changes is NO PROBLEM.     If there is one major complaint, it's how Ford has used such a thin layer of exterior paint.  It is unnecessary in my view that a vehicle intending to compete in head to head world class quality, is so easily chipped.  (The front clip area)   From the little I know of insects, (which help in paint stain\/chipping)  they are NOT on the endangered list as yet, so one would think a Company as intelligent as Ford would factor this in their formula.  Or perhaps they have,  and this is the result?     All in all, and great American choice.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Nearly eighteen months now with the Edge.  There is an issue with the dash lighting at night.  Though rare, they have flickered a few times, and at one point remained quit dim.  The gauges were visible, but were difficult to read instantly.  Not sure if this is connected, but when we move into Illinois time zone, the clock will not always update.  Sort of a hit and miss thing.  Ford tech guys could not locate an issue, asking if we accidentally touched the interior light switch.  Come on,,,  When driving??...  it's now \"our\" fault?   \n   The gauge lights returned to prior settings on it's own, but it makes you wonder if this is an electrical problem hiding for a special future event.  We have noticed recently that the side warning detector has become hyper sensitive. Surely todays four-door computers create a history which can trace such activity??\n Overall we enjoy the solid feel and drive, though mileage could be a shade better.   Still consider the Edge as a keeper, and for full disclosure,  We are NOT related to the Ford Family.","77":"This is our second Edge, replacing a darn near perfect 2013 Limited model. Our Titanium AWD is equipped with the 3.5 V6 (Edmunds must not think anyone chooses this engine over the pathetically underpowered 2.0 liter four-banger, so they don't allow that choice in the vehicle description above). The current 3.5 seems less powerful than the 2013 model and the fuel economy is still about 5 mpg less than the EPA ratings. If we buy another Edge, we will opt for the more powerful Sport model. Despite having two cameras and multiple sonar sensors that seem to have a mind of their own, this car is difficult to park because of the poor outward visibility (our vehicle ha the \"self-parking\" feature, but it's not something we use when parking in a drive-in slot at the mall). The front seats are a vast improvement in comfort and material quality over the model it replaced; however, the bottom seat cushions are still too short and do not adjust far enough with regards to tilting. Tilt steering wheel also is lacking in enough up & down movement. Despite all the complaints about how hard the electronics are to use, we find little or no issues with the nav, Hvac & radio controls. Rear seat room is spacious, but the inflating rear seat belts are a bear to use. Paint finish is impressive. Auto-dimming headlights are too easily fooled by other light sources and often stay on dim even when you are on a country road all by yourself. Heated & cooled seats work better than most others we've experienced and the heated steering wheel is terrific. Standard wheels on the Titanium are easier to keep looking good than the chrome-clad alloys that were on the 2013. Like the sonar warning parking aids, the rain-sensing wipers are a complete conundrum, they do whatever they want, whenever they want, even parking themselves during a steady rainfall. The rear window is impossible to keep clean, even in dry weather; a terribly designed rear spoiler actually traps dirt on the glass. Now let's talk about the massive glass sunroof; the rattling & creaking sound is unbearable and apparently has no permanent fix. Silicon spray on the rubber gasket it sits on will eliminate the noise...until you open & close it once! I coated the gasket with silicone last fall and haven't opened the glass since...now silent. Unless you are okay with keeping it permanently closed, save $1500 and don't buy it. 09\/02\/2016 Update on this flaw: After 15 months, Ford finally came up with a fix for this issue; they installed a thicker gasket around the glass roof that solved the problem!!  The other major, \"we can't fix it\" issue is the smell that the catalytic convertors emit when the car is driven under a full load on a long grade; the odor finds its way into the interior of the vehicle and is annoying to say the least. Previous models have a TSB issued and a kit available to alleviate this issue, but so far, not the 2015 model. One last complaint; the catch-all bottoms on the side doors. The design will hold about a quarter inch of sand, mud, crud, all along the bottom surface of the door, and washing the car necessitates opening each door and spraying the bottom edge to remove the silt.  Over-all, this vehicle has been disappointing, although not thoroughly unpleasurable to drive.  Other mid-sized cross-overs that we have bought & owned new prior to switching to Fords include the Volvo XC-70, Cadillac XRS (junk), Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited (also junk) and Mercedes GLK-350. This Edge is far from perfect, but we would at least consider buying one more version before we gave up on the either the model or the brand.","78":"Waited six or seven months to provide the review.  First some thoughts:  1.  Opt for the power liftgate.  The liftgate is heavy.  2.  This is a big car - bigger than it looks.  Think about this and be prepared in your garage and when parking.      This is our second Edge - we compared Highlander, Grand Cherokee, Audi Q3 & 5, Acura and a few other models.  The Edge is premium priced, but we used TruCar as the starting point and then let the dealers fight among themselves so we think we got a good deal.    Because of having other Ford products in the past, we researched the seats.  We have learned that -- at least for the CUV\/SUV -- you always avoid cloth seats if you want comfort and support.    The light leather is bad for picking up dye from blue jeans, so we have instructed the dealership to clean them everytime we go in for service -- under warranty.  We have had no rattles or squeaks - the only issue is that on an intermittent basis the brakes want to squeak - I can hear the echo when we are in a drive through.    Audio is OK - I realize that for x thousand more we could have had far better audio, but we decided to set and hold to a budget and I'm OK with it.  (Frustrating that I cannot insert paragraphs in this review - sorry about that - I know it makes it hard to read).  Car drives well and is easily quick enough to go on the freeway - our old Edge had the V-6 - this one has the I-4 turbo and it's OK.  We got the towing package and have pulled a lightweight trailer and more importantly - the bike rack!!!    Car handles very well -- sometimes a little hard to park because it's hard to tell where the front end is.  Backup camera is nicely done and evidently is a step above other cameras -- at least per our friends.  We have the old MyFordTouch - I have NEVER hand any issues with this system - don't know why Consumer Reports has hated it so bad because it's pretty logical to me.  If you have not owned a Ford product lately, be aware there is a large expanse of glass in front of you - but once you get used to that it makes the car feel a little more open.  SEL version should have had memory seat for driver, not just power - also should have had power seat for passenger.    Rear air vent into passenger compartment works well - also rear seats have some recline to them.  When rear seats are folded down, they are NOT completely flat - just FYI.  My mileage is good - we are not leadfoots, nor are we featherfoots - it did take a little while for the mileage to kick in - but we average about 26 around town and about 32 on the freeway at about 70 MPH.  No rattles no squeaks -- overall I think Ford really did a nice job - and especially with the design.  Yes, I would definitely purchase this car again.","79":"The only advantage for me was visibility - good ahead and good to the sides and rear.  This is a big vehicle which I find sluggish and it handles on the road like a commercial van.  The controls are not intuitive - I found the radio hard to operate (and annoying when it decides to do its own thing), the GPS hard to use, the heater \/ air con very hard to use.   The car is full of features and has lost sight of what a vehicle is about: driving.  The manual says a lot: 450 pages.","80":"Spent a week driving my sisters Lexus.  I was very surprised at how mediocre the car drives.  It looks nice, has an OK interior, but rides like a bucking bronco.  Truly, awful to ride in.  The soft suspension along with poor suspension control resulted in a bouncy, rocky ride.  My elderly mother, who usesly love to go for a drive did not like riding in the Lexus.  A week later a friend lent me his 2015 Edge for a long weekend drive into the mountains.  The car was comfortable, handled well and had a very controlled ride.  The Ford was way more comfortable than the Lexus and in many ways felt more up market.  Nice going Ford.","81":"Just bought a 2015 Edge SE that now has 2,000 miles. So far, several things have happened: 1. Tire Pressure Sensor Fault keeps going on and off. 2. Seems my gas gauge must be related to Houdini. I parked the Edge with half a tank and the next morning, a quarter tank had disappeared! (The service guy at the local Ford dealer said it was possible someone had stolen gas. No. The vehicle is kept in the garage 95% of the time. 3. Mysterious rattle in the front right passenger side. Motor Trend magazine said the cabin was \"littered with rattles.\" Seems Ford thinks rattles are a sign of quality. 4. Not getting the advertised gas mileage. This maybe due to break in period. I hope it is.  A vehicle should not rattle with just 2,000 miles on it. And the vehicle has only been on pavement, not off road.\nIf Ford does not fix this, then this will be my only Ford and will urge everyone I know NOT TO BUY a Ford.\n\nUPDATE: Well, the Edge now has 8,800 miles on it and another problem has developed. There is a noticeable \"clunking\" sound when the steering wheel is turned to the right. The \"clunk\" or \"thud\" can be felt through the floor board as well.  I am not the only one who has heard it. My wife has heard the noise and my dad who used to be a Ford mechanic. It will be interesting to see if the Ford dealership hears the noise or says it is normal. I can tell you it was not making this noise when I bought the car.   And the rattles continue. Now, there is a rattle behind the instrument console.","82":"Loved trying the 2015 Ford Edge but bought a 2016 Ford Edge Sport","83":"My 2015 Ford Edge Turbo 4 cylinder AWD is truly an amazing vehicle both from a styling and performance perspective.","84":"2015 Ford Edge is a great looking car; but looks can be deceiving. If you want cloth seats you can not buy the Titanium upgrade (which only has leather;  but boasts variable drivers' seat controls). So opt for cloth which I did with the base model and the drivers' seat has little or no control for comfort adjustments.  The seating is rock hard and offers very little to make it accommodating or enjoyable.\n\nThe tiny screen that displays the rear view camera image is a waste... so small you need glasses to use it with any accuracy. I don't both using that image generated by the otherwise clever rear-view camera.\n\nI can't get better than 23.9 mpg after 6,000 miles and I am a conservative driver with  no lead foot by any means.\n\nI like the size of the Edge when compared to the smaller Escape or larger Explorer.\n\nI am leasing and have about 2 plus years to go on this.  My thoughts at this point are to look outside the Ford or Lincoln family for next lease to see if I can find an SUV\/Crossover with much better front seat comfort.","85":"*New Issue - A couple months ago (around 6,500 miles), our brand new Ford Edge suddenly decelerated from 50 mph to 5 mph leaving us sitting alongside the road.  We were towed to the dealership.  Throttle body was replaced.  In the weeks before this occurred, I noticed changes in the car's acceleration, mainly between 40-60mph (you'd really have to tromp on the accelerator and raise the rpm's to get it to speed up).  We thought it was the transmission and took it to the dealership, who said they could find nothing wrong.  Currently, the car behaves like an older car with a fuel pump issue when it comes to accelerating - it's sluggish, feels like it has \"drag,\" and like you need to really press on the accelerator to expel gunk from it... that's the best analogy of how it drives these days.  I had read of a recent recall of approximately 88,000 Ford vehicles for fuel pump issues and was surprised our vehicle is not included.  \n\n*Updated 10\/7\/16 - Windows still fogging up excessively, leaving a filmy residue inside.  Scheduled to go to the dealership next week.  \n\n*Updated 4\/7\/16 - Scroll Down\nWe purchased a new 2015 Ford Edge SEL (3.5 L Cyclone V6 Series 4.0) on 2\/2\/2016 in Kenosha, WI. We noticed the windows fogging SEVERELY after taking it through a car wash, and then anytime it would rain (to the point the windows would remain fogged even with the defrosters on high). Also noticed water droplets in the tail lights. Took it to the dealership on 3\/25\/16 and learned it is LEAKING inside the interior of the vehicle! As of yet, our dealership is unable to diagnose the exact source of the leak. We have since learned that there is a LEAK PROBLEM WITH THE 2015 FORD EDGE AND DEALERSHIPS WERE INSTRUCTED NOT TO SELL IT. In researching this vehicle, this issue might escape the attention of consumers because it is not officially labeled a \"recall.\"  \n\nIn hopes of a resolution, we spoke with the Ford Regional Customer Service Manager (866-631-3788) who was adamant that Ford WILL NOT buy back from us this structurally defective vehicle. They insist our VIN# is not included in the leak issue - although the saturated interior of our vehicle seems to suggest otherwise.  If we attempt to sell this vehicle in the future, WE will have to disclose to potential buyers the very same defect that Ford concealed from us - and incur a financial loss. After all, who would pay full market price for a vehicle knowing it leaks inside? \n\nThis situation puts us in a bind in many ways.  To date, we've made only 1 car payment to our bank.  Will this vehicle even last for 59 more payments? Besides the financial repercussions, there's health and safety concerns.  Our son has severe asthma and allergies, including a documented allergy to mold.  How long was this leaky vehicle subjected to the elements in a dealership lot before we purchased it?  And, what's lurking inside the moist carpeting and overhead material, the cracks and crevices?  We expressed these valid concerns to Ford, as well as to the dealership, to no avail.  They refuse to buy back their defective new vehicle, insisting their only obligation is to repair it and \"dry it out\" by running the vehicle's heater.  We can only conclude that the well-being of children doesn't rank high on Ford's list of priorities.  \n\nIn exchange for buying back their defective vehicle, we've even proposed buying another Ford - a 2016 Ford Edge, or even a Ford Explorer (assuming no defects).  As long time GM owners and first time Ford owners, we were excited about our new relationship.  It appears that Ford does not reciprocate that zeal in their customer service, however.  It ceases the moment the customer signs on the dotted line.  \n\nUPDATE:  We stopped by the dealership on 4\/2\/16 for an update.  Last we'd heard our vehicle was taken to a glass shop and the windshield resealed, which failed to stop the leaking.  Next, it was taken to a body shop where a new windshield was recommended, and then ordered.  To our horror, on 4\/2\/16, we stopped by the dealership and found our new vehicle - leaks and all - sitting uncovered, in the pouring down rain and sleet, in the dealership lot - where it has been for days awaiting arrival of the new windshield.  In the very least, they could have covered it with a tarp.  To be continued....\n\nUPDATE (4\/7\/16):  Update: A \"pin-hole size leak in the body caulk of the upper right passenger window\" was discovered and filled. A glass company came again, squirted window cleaner and blew air from inside the vehicle. The leak revealed itself on the outside where the glass cleaner started bubbling. Dealership said water was in the carpet and flooring, and on some wiring, but that the vehicle subsequently passed the leak test and water should no longer enter the interior. Ford also is replacing the right and middle tail lights. Hoping no further water damage surfaces in the future from this leak. Our vehicle should be done Friday, April 8th!","86":"Make sure you take it for a good test drive.  2015 Ford Edge, dirt through out the inside of the vehicle.  Seals on doors loose or coming off.  White substance on inside back of lift gate.  White particles through the inside of the vehicle.","87":"Great vehicle; ok design; lots of features. Didn't see the need for spending $$$ for for the egocentric amenities in the upper models - the car companies have figured out that people will spend a LOT on their egos.","88":"I and several others that have rode with me find the front seats very uncomfortable.  It actually feels like your sitting in a bucket.  The power seat doesn't have enough lower adjustment on the fron portion of the seat so a lot of weight is under your legs and thighs with the hard seating bolsters on the side.  The other major complaint I have is that the door seals don't seal well enough and allows dirt sand snow etc to be thrown up under them...really shoddy workmanship.  I have to believe Edmunds and others must get incentives to write the rave reviews they have given this car.  Also with cheap gas its no big deal but my I-4 Turbo has good power but will not get even close to what is posted on estimate.  Then if you figure the mileage longhand you will find its even worse than what the trip computer says.  The 28 mpg posted must be going down hill with a tail wind.  Count on 21-23 real world running 70-75 mph","89":"I drove a 2007 Ford Edge until I purchased my 2015 Ford Edge. Overall both have been great cars as far as fuel efficiency and smooth ride, however, I do have complaints about each. The 07 had very little range of motion for the AC vents, which could not be completely closed off and could not be directed off the passenger seat which meant traveling with my husband I had to keep a heavy blanket in the front seat as he likes the AC cold. The seats were not comfortable, especially the middle back seat; VERY hard. I couldn't wait to get my new Ford Edge and immediately, on the test drive, discovered that the seats were far more comfortable than the 07 and the AC vents had full range and could be closed off completely. Thank you Ford! Unfortunately for everything Ford fixed, I discovered other nuisance problems: 1)the storage in the door, where I keep my water bottle - because of the contoured design of the door handle, I cannot easily remove the water bottle without bumping into the contoured handle, causing the bottle to slip from my hands an spill on the floor, and I am a small person, with small hands; 2)the convenient tray in front of the gear stick in the 07, which was the perfect place for me to place items while driving to work (about 4 x 6 or so)- cell phone, vitamin container, office keys, is no longer there so NO place to set my stuff; 3) the center console and cup holders are now so far back that for a shorter person like me, I cannot grab a cup from the cupholder or open the console with my right hand as it is all set too far back. I have to reach over with my left hand while driving to pick anything up from the cupholders. En the 07 the cupholder was beside the gear stick, not behind it and the armrest was in a comfortable proximity to the seat; 4) the door handle, 07 design was a closed handle so if I wanted to drop a small item - paperclip, Tylenol, whatever, for ease in grabbing quickly - is open now so NO tiny, convenient little door storage.\n\nI realize all these may seem petty, but they made enough difference in my daily travel routine that I will NOT be purchasing another Ford Edge not do I plan to keep this one for any length of time!","90":"I have owned this vehicle for 9 months. First off, I love how this SUV drives like a car and handles very well.  The acceleration of the 4-cylinder turbo is superb here at high elevation in Colorado, whereas a lot of other 4-cylinder vehicles are lacking in power.  I purchased the SEL with leather and both power driver and passenger seats, automatic liftgate (which I love), upgraded sound system etc.  The rear legroom is plentiful and it's awesome that the rear seat reclines (Although, I have small children and am not able to recline it yet).  The AWD is great; my vehicle handles way better in the snow than my Jeep that I traded in.  Around town I average about 25 mpg per tank.  I recently went on a 3000 mile road trip to Georgia and averaged around 27-28 mpg sometimes.  The seats were comfortable on the trip up to about 10 hours of driving in one day.  The interior is very quiet and the vehicle has a smooth ride. The safety of the vehicle is top notch, which I can attest to being involved in a 9 vehicle accident on the interstate a couple months ago.  An SUV pushed a pickup truck into the back of my Edge.  It felt like a hard impact but I only had a tiny dent on the plastic rear bumper cover which people don't even notice (The pickup's bumper was hanging off). The only con I had was shortly after I purchased the vehicle and a rattling noise was coming from the driver's side door speaker.  It seems like over time it has resolved itself. Overall, the new Ford Edge is a pleasure to drive.","91":"The EDGE Sport has lots of bells and whistles including Front\/Rear climate controlled seats and terrific safety features (blind spot, peripheral collision warnings, front\/rear cameras, parking assist).  Surprisingly excellent, effortless and smooth acceleration from a 4cyl.  Sleek body style, keyless entry, remote start and comfort's a plus.  Ford's SYNC system is a little daunting to setup, because of the 400K possible voice commands controlling entertainment, climate, comm, and nav systems.  The spectacular panoramic moon roof stretches the length of the vehicle.  Roomy lighted cargo area with rear seats up (including electric rear seat controls accessible near the hatch) and handsfree lift gate that sounds a safety alarm when opening and closing.  It would be nice to have a handstrap on the gate for manual operation and a bumper step, otherwise, it's solid.  Lots of USB and accessory ports!  \n\nThe only downside is Ford's 60K warranty.  Doesn't cover all electrical.  However, I found that the extended coverage was price negotiable. \n\nOverall a pretty good value for the $42K price (incl TTL).","92":null,"93":"I had my Ford Edge Edge towed to the local Ford dealership here in Idaho Falls, ID on November 23rd. It is now December 24th and it is sitting at the dealership under a couple feet of snow. I have just made my car payment for my reliable Ford vehicle. Two modules went out that control the remote entry and the push button ignition. I was stranded in the middle of winter with no heat and had to call for a tow. The dealership has been horrible with communication. I was sent to my regional customer service representative who said he would work on  getting the part here faster. I was told the part would be here on December 17th. I finally called that evening to find out that the weather has slowed the shipping and it should be in on the 18th. Apparently the mule they are using walks very slow cause the shipment came in last night. It is now almost 11:09 am in Idaho and they still have not located the part.  No vehicle for the weekend! Repairs made this year on my Ford Edge:\n-Main system that runs my climate and radio had to be replaced.\n-Rails on panoramic roof needed replacement.\n-Alarm stopped working on automatic tailgate stopped working.\n-Brake Booster tore. Known problem.\n-PTU seal leaking and stinks up car. Known problem \n-Two modules went out on remote entry and ignition. This caused my battery to fry and needed replacement.\n****Please read the car complaints forum's before you buy a Ford Edge***** I would not recommend this vehicle to a friend or family  member!","94":"The Edge is absolutely awesome! I have owned three Toyotas (Sienna, Rav4, and Camry). After one month ownership of my Toyotas, they were just cars. The Edge impresses me more every day. I just love the Edge. It is easy to get in and out. The Edge handles great and you always feel in control. The workmanship is first class. On another note, my sons wanted me to buy a BMW X3 or X5. I am so happy I bought the Edge instead of either of those!","95":"I have had Ford Edge Sport for the past 2 months. These words come to my mind: Solid, Fun, Sporty and a delight to drive.  Blind spot monitoring, Lane Departure Warning and gentle nudge back to the lane, excellent blue tooth are all technological pluses.  Steering, handling are top class. Very quiet inside, very little road noise. Quite roomy especially the second row and adequate cargo. Overall, quite impressive.","96":"Redesigned for the Gen 2 the 2015 is really fun to drive. \n\nI was less then impressed with the previous version of the Edge, so I was skeptical taking a test drive. Wow they changed this vehicle, comfortable, design and what they used.  Some thing I would have made standard is every model should have the LED rear red Light Bar, Power mirrors with integrated blind spot mirrors , also every version have intelligent access with push button start, I have this partially I have push button start and the rear gate is intelligent access but not the doors.  Every model should also include the front and rear parking sensors.  Other then that everything else could be optional. \n\n2.0 EcoBoost AWD in Magnetic, black interior, Rear inflatable Seatbelts\n\nPros:\nComfortable\nAmazingly a lot of power\nLow road noise\nvery nice controls\n\nCons:\nEverything I mentioned that should be be standard.","97":"Mechanical: \n\n1) The 2.7L twin turbo V6 puts out some serious power at 315 HP and 350 FT LBS torque. The technology in the engine is shared with Fords Powerstroke Diesel in that the engine block is made from compacted graphite iron. It is quiet as a sewing machine but does make some nice sounds when you put the go-pedal down.\n2) Two small turbochargers vs. one large one equate to virtually undetectable turbo lag. This is a very good thing.\n3) The Sport has a very dialed in suspension for a stock vehicle. In all honesty this crossover thinks it is a sports car.\n\nInterior:\n\n1) The suede\/leather in our Sport is better quality than expected. Seats are very comfortable and interior is mostly devoid of the cheap plastic feel I abhor in many vehicles (think GM). \n\nFit\/Finish:\n\n1) Our Edge is the black metallic. It looks great and I have gone over the car with a fine tooth comb and everything is spot on. I am a Toyota guy (Edge is my girlfriends driver) and do not suffer manufacturers that produce poor fit and finish. I am impressed with the Edge. \n\nValue\/Competitors:\n\n1) Thus far the Edge Sport has been worth every dime of its cost. My girlfriend originally wanted to look at the Nissan Murano and I started looking at other crossovers for her to consider as the Nissan CVT transmission has a far less than stellar reliability rating and resale value leaves a lot to be desired. Both of us agreed that the Edge Sport is better looking, way better performing and overall a better value than the competition. No GM vehicles were considered, several other manufacturers were.\n\nSummary:\n\n2500 miles on the vehicle and thus far 100% happy.","98":"have had 4 weeks. It is a Titanium AWD with 3.5  V6 .Carpet material and mats  poor quality, lint sticks to surface and vacuum struggles to extract.\n Trunk light location poor. Put in 1 bag and light is hidden.  Navigation control cumbersome.  Visibility good except when entering tight space, hood design is high obscuring front side view.  The trunk cargo cover design is poor. Does not sit high enough to stack 2 pieces of luggage. Have to remove cover  to get more luggage in trunk. Not very helpful when travelling and you need to park in a lot for a break. Instrument display OK.  Tach display is very poor. Indicator data points hide actual RPM display. Display is too small. sits right next to fuel gauge and requires deliberate focus to see, cant just glance for view of RPM\nI exhaust tailpipe is bent and dealer cant fix. Dealer has not suggested how it will be fixed.\nToo early to judge gas mileage. So far around 22 overall for distance driving, 17 in city. Performance not bad. Still going easy on acceleration but not a zippy as our 2012 Santa Fe.\n Love new adaptive cruise control, waited 4 months to get this feature.\n Ride and comfort excellent. Panoramic sun roof is very nice at this time of year. Car does feel big when driving in tight spaces. Operating door locks is still confusing, touch control isn't consistent in operation. Touchless trunk opening also vague. We have the tow hitch so swinging leg has to be done with caution or your shin is in danger. Overall we are pleased with our purchase so far.\nUPDATED 6\/4\/2016. We have added around 8000 miles. The driving and comfort are still excellent. MPG has maintained 22\/24 and better dependent on load and speeds, had some long days cruising at 80 mph and still got 21+ mpg. Also had quite a load on board, 2 occupants and 300-400 lbs of luggage and gifts.\nThe engine has loosened up and is still a quiet cruiser, the transmission likes to drop a couple of gears when climbing mountains which can get noisy, I have found dropping the cruise 5 mph eases the stress as it will change up a gear. I have found that there is a second Tach' which displays automatically when selecting the S mode for the transmission, it is also accessed when going through the menu for instrument display. The touchless tailgate is easier to use with some practice, nice feature. The adaptive cruise control is \"SIMPLY Marvelous \", wont buy a car without it from now on. On 600 mile sections of our  journey I hardly used the gas pedal, and it works down to 25 mph, great when  the speed limit in small towns drops to 25 and then quickly goes back to 75. Just used the cruise to adjust, very easy on the back and legs. Have gotten used to the Navigation, a bit quirky but the voice control works quite well and the search quality has been very good at finding Seattle's Finest. Had the first oil change while in ND, nice and quick. So far no problems, very happy with our purchase.","99":"I just leased my 2015 SEL in October.   I love the way it drives and handles on the road.  However; it has been in the shop twice with electrical issues in a month.  The first time was when I tried to turn on the heat and no air came out.  It turned out being a faulty pin according to the dealer.   The next time was an electrical issue that prevented the car from starting and just about every warning light came on in the process.   I'm beginning to question the reliability of this model.   I traded in my 2013 Focus for the Edge, thinking that I was getting a better made vehicle , as I had electrical problems with the Focus, as well.   \n\nTo add insult to injury, the dealer (Lester Glenn) has a ridiculous  loaner car program where there is a two week wait and only about 3 vehicles, according to the service manger.  Are you kidding?   Perhaps if there is that much volume in the service department, the dealer should invest in more loaner cars.   Also, they should give priority to customers who purchase vehicles at the dealer.  FORD= Fix Or Repair Daily!","100":"This is one of the best prices vehicles for all its options. I literally was able to get every option I could think of (outside a heated steering wheel) and most car brands didn't even OFFER all these options or wanted $10k more for all of them. I exceptionally happy with the mpg, handling, and technology. They are truly putting Out their best effort and my consumer confidence is rapidly climbing. Go Ford!","101":"We bought our Edge 4 weeks ago and we have enjoyed the car immensely. Today I drove our Edge up to Big Bear Mountain which is 30 miles and an elevation climb from 1500 feet to 7200 feet. I was concerned about the power of the turbo 2L engine, but I am happy to report that our Edge powered up the mountain equal our better than my V6 Acura TL. We have been able to get 30+MPG on the freeway and average about 24 MPG combined.\n\nLove the remote engine start this evening with the outside temperature at 20\u00b0F.\n\nLooking forward to our next trip in 2 weeks on Pacific Coast Highway between Carmel and Morro Bay.  We will update on the car after that trip.","102":"We bought the SE and there are two things that I don't care for.\n\nIf you leave the fob in the Edge and lock the doors with the lock on the door they will lock, the same as locking the keys in your old car.  With the electronics they should be able to prevent this or give a warning when the fob is left in the Edge.  My Edge has no keypad entry.  They give you a key but that is probably at home.\n\nI do not have the auto stop\/start feature.  Wish that I had gotten the auto start\/stop feature.","103":"Waited from May order until September build and October delivery  in order to obtain Drivers Assistance package on a Titanium Edge with 3.5 V-6. After a five hundred mile freeway trip, I am very glad I did. It is a wonderful workload reducer and safety feature. Really a fine enhancement to a comfortable driving experience.  Also like the blind spot alert and the drivers wheel alert shudder when straying out of lane. Got 25.1 mpg on the freeway and looks like it will be about 19-20 overall. The car is a comfortable five star that was over my initial budget, but glad I went for it. We have aged up and now need safety and comfort more than value.","104":"So I am a 24 year old and have had my 2015 Ford Edge titanium with the 2.0 eco boost 4cyl in the guards green color for a bit over a month. So far, very satisfied with the car. The color is awesome, almost like a Greyish-green. Great ride height, good visibility of the road. The 4 cyl, in my opinion is enough power for the car. I would imagine the 6 cyl version being terrible on gas mileage. I drive mainly city, stop and go traffic in Brooklyn and I am averaging 16.2mpg for approx 1200 miles I have already put on the car. Interior is extremely comfortable. A lot of technology!!! Bluetooth is very easy to use and responsive. Touch screen display is excellent as well. I have ambient lighting in the vehicle as well which I love. Another feature I find my self using is the foot activated rear lift gate. Very useful believe it or not. Also the auto start fuction from the key fob is excellent. Use it almost every day, I anticipate using it daily once the winter hits the north eastOverall I am very satisfied with the vehicle and deffinetly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxury SUV","105":"I was originally going to buy a Taurus SHO but decided the Edge Sport would be more practical for my specific needs. I have owned many cars over the years and put a lot of miles on some pretty bad roads in all types of weather, unfortunately I can't comment on the Edge's winter performance yet. What I can tell you is that this crossover is absolutely great on the highway and very pleasant to drive in an urban environment.  It's quite, and soaks up bumps and irregularities in uneven road surfaces like a big luxury car. What it doesn't do is have a ton of body roll or wobbly feeling like a lot of vehicles in this segment. I suspect this is due to the stiffer springs and bigger anti sway bars on the sport model. Cargo storage and access is very good, the stereo is better than average, the navigation system is pretty straight forward and loads fast, visibility is also good, however I personally find the inability to turn the lane departure system completely off rather annoying as I don't always use turn signals so that little shudder it sends through the steering column when I'm passing is a bit distracting.  Yes, it has bunch of bells and whistles but the real reason to buy this thing is the engine. The 2.7 v6 twin turbo is absolutely incredible. The power is very linear and triple digits happen in the blink of an eye. The thing is you never realize how fast your accelerating until you look at the speedometer or the line of cars in the rear view mirror and it does it so smoothly and quite. It's not a Corvette or Porsche 911 but I can assure you an X5 or Lexus is going to be embarrassed  if they challenge you on the 4 lane. My point is to find the level of technology and performance you find under the hood of this thing you would have to spend a lot more and it will be from Europe.","106":"First I have a 2015 SEL 3.5L (which is not listed) \nI traded my 2013 for the 2015. The ride felt better, looked better and handled better. 2 weeks after I bought it I noticed after it rained, there was moisture in the rear center reflector and tail lamp lenses. It went away a\nfter a couple days. I washed it in a touchless car wash and the moisture \nreappeared. Willowbrook Ford agreed that there was an issue, they took \npictures and emailed them to Ford. \nFord authorized replacing the rear \nlamps and center reflector. After \nWillowbrook Ford repaired my Edge \nthey washed it and I picked it up. When \nI got home I noticed moisture in rear \ntail lamp lenses again.  I will update this \nreview...\nUPDATE; 5\/5\/16 After taking pictures multiple times and having Willowbrook\n Ford take them twice, Ford has \nauthorized the rear lights to be \nreplaced again. This time they have a \nTSB indicating a torque procedure. In \nthe last month the TPMS light has come \non for the right rear tire. The display \nread --- after the tires were rotated. It still occurred at the right front now. Ford replaced both right side sensors. Otherwise the vehicle has performed \nwell and is very comfortable. Towing \n(2300 lb boat) with the Edge is good \nand MPG are 13.8, towing at 70mph.","107":"Traded in our 2012 ford escape for the new 2015 edge. We actually own a SEL 6 cyl. (But the review wouldn't give me the option). It's a responsive engine, Doesn't feel sluggish. We still aren't getting great MPG. But I suppose that'll come the more we break it in. Has a few blind spots, but that's to be expected with any vehicle... it's still easy to maneuver. Easy to see out of. I test drove the hyundai santa fe sport and it doesn't even come close to the edge! The edge feels more sturdy. I feel it'll last a long while! We have a 4 yr old and it's easy for her to get in and out of the vehicle, she has plenty of room in the back and she loves the cup holders that come down from the back middle seat. We unfortunately haven't taken it on a long drive that's over 2 hrs. But so far the front seats seem comfortable for both me and my husband. We are loving it! Love the close tailgate button.. very handy for me only being 5'3. My only concern is the material they used around the cupholders. It seems to scratch very easily. But other than that, we are very happy with our purchase and plan to keep it for years!!","108":"2015 edge SEL AWD now has 25,000\nContinues to Drive like a Lexus but more European tight steering. The car is firm and feels solid.\nNo squeaks tight and firm truly remarkable car for the money.  24 mpg per gallon respectable for mid size SUV.\nWent through a tough winter with much snow and handled it very well. I would definitely buy this vehicle again.","109":"The Edge is a comfortable, quiet car with good pickup and a smooth ride. I like the technology, it was easy for me to learn. I'm still getting use to the backup camera, this is a great feature but does take some getting use to. So over all I like the car and I am looking forward to many years of service form it.","110":"So I traded in a Focus Titanium for an Edge SEL with all of the extra options. I'll start off by saying I absolutely love the look, the ride quality is great, and the 2.0 has great power. I'll start out listing the pros; the hands free lift gate is a really nice feature to have and my wife loves the panoramic sun roof. The Edge drives really well and the base EcoBoost motor has plenty of pickup. The leather inside feels high quality and my wife and I have I issues with the seats as some other owners were saying. Now for some of the cons; the Edge has some noises inside. I have not yet gone to the dealership to ask them to fix the issues but the biggest one is the drivers side door has an air leak somewhere up by the drivers left ear. It's a squeak once you are driving a certain speed. Another noise inside the vehicle is the back seat. The bottom bench cushion has two clips that rattle non stop even when the vehicle is just idling and not moving. I luckily did not have the water leaking like some other owners but I have noticed the hood moves and shimmies sometimes while driving. The only other issue I am having is with a bubble in the drivers side door in the paint. Again, I have not gone back to the service department yet so I cannot comment on how quick ford will help with the issue. Overall I am pleased with the purchase and will be extatic if the issues get resolved through the dealer.","111":"The \"Edge\" is very comfortable.  I rented this model to go on  a trip from NC to Tennessee.   Car did great until we encountered the curves in the Tennessee mountains.  The rear of the car felt like it was coming up to the front when going in to curves.   Rear traction very unstable.  Tires had correct air pressure, only 2000 miles on car.  Navigating through the electronics (via the up and down, left and right arrows, on the left side lever) is terrible.   The Auto Traction function is (in my opinion) useless.  I Definitely like \"the ride comfort\" but, the traction and instability in curves turns the \"Purchase Option\" off for me.","112":"We traded in our 2013 Edge SEL and opted for the 2015 Edge Titanium. We are very impressed with the new design both inside and out. Our new Edge is as quiet if not more than my mother in laws 2015 BMW X5. The ride quality has improved even with the optional 20in Tires. I know people gripe about the My Ford Touch, but knock on wood we have never had any issues. The push button controls are a nice alternative to My Ford Touch. The engine provides more than enough power for us in the hills in and around Pittsburgh. We are still under 5000 miles, but continue to be pleased with our purchase. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.","113":"I recently leased this 2015 Edge Sport. The list price was just over $48K. Because I wanted the 21\" wheel option, my dealer traded for my vehicle with another Ford dealer in a neighboring state. So the first time I saw my vehicle was at delivery. In the euphoria of new car purchase, I failed to recognize what I discovered the following day upon closer examination. I was disappointed to find the following quality shortcomings; carpet fit poorly to expose raw floor pan, loose panel on console, loose door trim, poorly fitting driver side door, poorly fitting hood, damaged and ill-fitting window trim. The quality of this vehicle is jaw-dropping awful. I'm embarrassed to be seen in it. It appears to have been assembled by third world slaves. My wife's 2009 $15K Honda Fit is of light years better quality than this piece of crap. Can't wait for my lease to end. I may end it early - it's that bad. I should have bought the Murano despite its ugly front end - it at least was screwed together with better quality. No more Ford's in my future.","114":"Very car like ambience, ride quality and handling.  It feels like the center of gravity is much lower than it actually is with flat cornering and a composed ride.  Impressive NVH suppression in Titanium edition despite the bigger wheels.  Wait for 2016 and Sync3, as the current touch screen is often counterintuitive and as slow as molasses.  Good connectivity and power supply options available except USB below center stack is almost impossible to reach.  Hands free lift gate leads to cavernous and well finished cargo area.  Back seats roomy and with easy ingress\/egress.  Not sure about structural build quality as you can watch the hood sheet metal vibrating a bit along the power bulges stamped into it, but the cage structure seems quite stiff and protective.  Flashy lighting and upscale features.  A very good Ford.","115":"My new Edge has the ecoboost 4cyl with trailer package. My experience is that it does everything well EXCEPT FOR...... (see below). \nIt provides a comfortable confidence inspiring ride.  The interior is well done. Road noise, rattles etc. are negligible.  Fit and finish are good. It tows VERY well. Gas milage is very good; 14mpg towing 3,000 lbs and 23mpg otherwise.    \n\nEXCEPT FOR ......   The front seats are not comfortable. They appear to be designed for children and Twiggy. I am an average person, 5'9\" 170 lbs, the seat is too narrow for me. Someone got carried away trying to put a racing type car seat in this model. The seat bolsters on the side of the seat are too pronounced without adequate room in-between. The result is that there is not adequate room for you butt. The side bolsters squeezes your bum together just like a pair of too small shoes  squeezes your toes together.  My front seat passengers have also complained of this condition.  As I like this car, I will take it to an automotive upholstery shop and have the seats redesigned. \n\nI wish the steering wheel would be more adjustable - - my wife's Dodge Caravan adjusts wonderfully.  But I don't  think I can swap that out :-) \n UPDATE AUG 2016   I am a little more comfortable with the seat - all my other comments are still actuate.  ANOTHER ITEM BUGS ME --> the speedometer's midpoint, at the 12 o'clock position, shows 80mph !  When the speedometer needle is straight up (12 o'clock position) It should be 50mph or 60mph NOT 80 ! The end point of the speedo is 160mph !  This car would have be dropped from a satellite to get to 160mph.\nUPDATE Feb 5 2017  The seat feels a little better - I absolutely HATE the speedo set-up (funny how little things can bug you) I overstated towing mileage --> I'm getting 12mph when towing --> overall VERY GOOD CAR","116":"The late model 2015 I have is really the new 2016 new model.\n\nWhat I find very dangers is the kick under bumper rear hatch close and open. It only opens when the sending unit is in your pocket, so you have to remember to take it out or it will activate it. If you reach in to get something to far the hatch comes down on your head.  This has happen many times and, I asked my dealer if they could disconnect it and was told they could not. I reached in to get my fishing poles out and the hatch started coming down, had to move fast. \n\nNo protection on the top of the rear bumper so the paint gets chipped taking things in and out","117":"This is my fourth Edge since 2007. As the years models changed over the car keeps getting better looking. We use our Edges for trip to FL around 1200 miles and have no problems. All cars have not let us down. Smooth ride and great colors.","118":"I love the exterior look of the new Edge, and the interior design and layout is top notch, rivaling the European luxury brands. \r\n\r\nHowever... Almost immediately after my purchase, my Edge Titanium was spending more time in the dealer's service department than in my garage, due to either a manufacture issue or a design problem that caused a very annoying noise on the driver side (and now the passenger side) of the cabin. \r\n\r\nFord didn't care enough to offer any assistance, and the car does not (yet) qualify for buy back per CA definifion of the Lemon Law.\r\n\r\nI am very disappointed in my first Ford experience. My advice is to stay away for now, or, if you must have one, proceed with caution! ","119":"The new Edges is a great vehicle except for the plastic base of the front seats. Bolstering is good, but the plastic base sides prevent flexibility in the seat bottoms and prevent comfort on extended trips. Big miss for a great new design ","120":"I test drove the Edge and loved it right away. I have the SEL V6 and most of the packages. I test drove a Toyota Highlander but it was noisier and I did not like the steering feel. I wanted to test a V6 Outback but there were none within 75 miles. This is my first vehicle with electronic steering and I liked it better than a CRV that I drove. The vehicle is quiet, smooth, comfortable and has plenty of headroom (I'm 6-02). I can't rate reliability. I've owned four Fords with no major problems. The Edge drives like a heavier sports car with a nice solid feel. Ford has stepped up their game when it comes to refinement.","121":"After having my new 2015 Edge for about 6 weeks I am overall very pleased. The 4cyl turbo charged engine is more powerful than the 6cyl that my 2008 Edge or 2013 Explorer had. It has great acceleration. The braking is much improved and does not have that mushy feel that many Ford vehicles have. The new exterior design is sportier and more sleek than the previous Edge. I love the new two tone leather interior giving it a higher end feel. I miss the power lift gate that my Explorer had and wish it was a standard feature. The interior cabin is much quieter than my last two vehicles.  There are also more display features for fuel economy etc. ","122":"I have complained to Hyundai that the 2017 Santa Fe SE has a passenger side wiper that is too short at 14\". It leaves a 1\" space between the two wipers that leaves a V-shape between the blades that interferes with driver and passenger vision in rain or snow. I replaced the blade with a 15 \" blade and all is fine now. Hyundai did nothing for me in fixing the problem except offer to pay for the new blade. This is a safety problem that should be a RECALL on all the new Hyundai's that have this problem. Disappointed that with all the technology and teams of designers that such a problem wasn't found and corrected before the SUV hit the market.","123":"My wife and I are well into our seventies and have reached a point were ease of entry and exit has become important when it comes to our main transportation. Many of our friends have had knees and hips replaced and are a \"little on the heavy side\" and they like wise have the same needs. With this as a back drop we realized we needed a SUV. Our last car was a 2013 Toyota Avalon a tuff act to follow for the average SUV when it comes to driving dynamics,performance and efficiency. Spent more time researching,driving and comparing vehicles then we ever have in our lives. Looked at SUV's,when comparably equipped to this car cost upwards of $60,000 and kept coming back to the Santa Fe. Wife liked the size of the Lexus RX350 but we both thought the styling was hideous especially the front end and so it went as we one by one eliminated the completion for this vehicle. Yep in the end we just liked this thing the best The fact it was the best bang for the buck was just frosting on the cake. After following the manufactures break in recommendations to the letter made our first trip to see our grand kids. As you can imagine we have made this trip many times. Expected mileage would fall well short of our Avalon but was surprised to see a average of 27.3 MPG going down in windy conditions and 29.5 mpg coming back. Our Avalon averaged around 30-31mpgs. Amazing. Seat comfort was outstanding the seats fit us like a glove. Ride comfort was just the way I like it firm but not harsh and well controlled. Fair share of hills and turns on our route and the handling was very Avalon like once you started to trust it and drive it accordingly. Loading up the Grandkids and the their parents for a short trip got rave reviews and youngest who loved the climate controls in the third row and dug the simulated Surround Sound of the killer 12 speaker \"sound system\". Son in law was amazed how favorably the vehicle compared to their new Acura. Found every feature easy to use and love the old school buttons and knobs verses the latest touch screen menu drive stuff that is the current fad. GPS is a snap to program easier the the Avalon. Almost as good a my Garmin which is still my favorite over all. Hard to fault this car but here goes. The drivers seat has a noticeable ripple in one of the panels in the bottom edge of the seat. Might go away with a little use but if not I will talk to the service manager and Hyundai about it. That's about it for complaints.","124":"We were looking for a mid-sized SUV to replace our 2004 Toyota Highlander which we loved. We test drove the new Highlander and thought that was hard to see over the dash and the engine lacked power. We investigated the Honda Pilot but it looked huge, was really expensive and the dealer wouldn't budge much from MSRP. The dealer actually bragged about the fact that they sell near MSRP. So we decided to try the Hyundai Santa Fe even though we had never owned one before, based on internet and Consumer Reports reviews. I had previously driven an older Hyundai Santa Fe model as a rental and had liked it. So we picked out the Santa Fe SE with the Premium Package based on features\/price and found a local dealer in Massachusetts. They gave us a great quote over the Internet, just a bit over invoice price. You can still figure out dealer invoice prices using a site like MSN Autos. Don't bother using sites like True Car, they basically give dealers a lead on your business and not the best price for you. We did much better looking directly at dealer sites.  The Hyundai dealer was great, very helpful in all aspects of the purchase. All the features we got with the Santa Fe would have easily cost $10K more on the Honda Pilot. We've had the Santa Fe about 3 months now through the NE winter. The AWD is excellent in the snow and the V6 is really powerful on the highway. It cruises at 85 mph easily. We've driven to northern Vermont, and Maine. It has a very comfortable quiet ride. Not sure why other people were complaining about wind noise I haven't heard it. The rear and 3rd row seats split to allow you to put skis in, very useful as you can still get 5 people in the car with skis. Kids in the 3rd row only though. The ride is not super sporty but it has a good road feel. The safety features are excellent. Rear view camera and proximity warning systems on the side mirrors work great. My only minor complaints are that the electronic dash system is a bit complicated, the front seatbelt clips are a bit low and I don't like the feel of the leather steering wheel. Also, you can only listen to the radio about 10 minutes without the engine running, the it shuts off. I think I will get used to all these issues over time. Overall the Santa Fe is an excellent SUV choice, I definitely recommend test driving one.","125":"This is a perfect SUV, it's not overly big or too small.  It's large enough for adequate storage yet doesn't take a lot of space when parking.  The look is also very sporty looking.  The ride is smooth and we've been VERY happy with it.  If there was one thing that I would have added it would have been to have the option of having the back window to pop up instead of having to open the whole door when getting groceries.  But, the back door opens and closes automatically; it even opens on its own when you're hands are full of groceries and can't get to your keys.  GREAT SUV all around.","126":"Great vehicle in every respect, love the advanced technology package, Hyundai Santa Fe rules!!","127":"Only 2000 miles, but so for it's been great.","128":"This is a great car. It looks nice, rides nice, and has great features. The only thing I would say is that the navigation system seems a bit pointless with Carplay\/Android Auto and you can't get some of the more advanced features without spending thousands on navigation. Other than that, I am happy with the vehicle. The seats are comfortable, power is nice, ride is smooth for a SUV crossover. I have no complaints. There is very little room for cargo if the back seats are up but that is to be expected.","129":"Its been 3 months since i won this car. The features are really good for the price compared to competitors.I really like the smart cruise,sunroof and DBL features. And the warranty is reallly good. Below are the areas it needs lot of improvement 1. Navigation : worst navigation system, half of the address are not found 2. Noise, there is considerable road noise coming from behind, which leads to bad ride experience. 3. Lowest fuel economy in this segment. 4. Cargo space is less compared to pilot\/highlander","130":"I really like the Santa Fe so far, have not owned a Hyundai before, have had Toyotas and Hondas, so thought I would give it a try.  This is a nice SUV for us, not too big, not too small, so easy to park, but still hauls all of us and our stuff.  I added a Curt trailer hitch myself and this was very easy to do.  The Santa Fe has a lot of options for the money.  I really like the surround view camera, I do use this often when parking.  Good visibility.  Have a few rattles from back seat and will have dealer check that for me, seems to be coming from passenger back seat.  I had similar small rattles from Toyota Venza I had before, and Chevy Silverado before that - usually it's a cable rubbing, or a piece of trim that needs a little shim or a small piece of felt, so we will see...Also will see how things go with more miles, I do like the long warranty From Hyundai.  Other than the small rattle, this seems to be well built, very logical controls and layout of the interior.","131":"My second Santa Fe.  Had first one for 8 years. Highly recommend.","132":"We looked at the Mazda 9, the Toyota Highlander, the Ford Explorer, the Chevy Traverse, and the Honda Pilot.  Nothing came close to the Santa Fe as far as value for the dollar. We had a 2007 Santa Fe that gave us very little problems and that followed a 2006 sonata that was equally as reliable. Some of the other vehicles had some aspects that bettered the Santa Fe but in its entirety the 2017 Santa Fe bested them all.","133":"i am in the market for an suv with 6-8 seat my option were the Hyundai Santa Fe, KIA sorento, Toyota highlander, and the Honda pilot. I first went to see the santa fe and it looked really nice the drl made it better looking than before so the sales person let me take it for a test drive. as i got out of the dealership and on to the main road it felt like it had power to hit 40-50 mph. but as i was trying to slow down to make a right turn i felt the car just bogged down as i try to accelerate to enter the other street that to me seemed pretty dangerous because the if there was a car coming i could of gotten hit. so the sales person made me turn to another street where there was a lot of bump so i drove around 40 to see how the suspension would perform, and honestly it was the worst ride as i heard loud thump as if the the rear struts were bad or something, any little thump could be heard very clearly, it was far worse for my parent that were sitting in the back because they said that the car didn't even cushion any of the bump and that they were bouncing the entire time we were on that road , it felt like riding a horse. also the brakes are a little mushy for a 4000lb car i would expect the suspension to be somewhat decent . i have a versa and a old 98 town car and the suspension is 5 times better than the santa fe. i felt sorry to tell the salesperson that we weren't interested in the car because of the ride quality.","134":"Worst navigation system on the planet.  It locates about half the destinations I've tried to input.  The system makes no suggestions; just says it can't locate the address.  Even my home at 6200 ***** street, built in 2009 can't be input because the nav system only shows street numbers up to 6199. Haven't been back to dealer yet to have it checked but maybe I got 10-year old software.","135":"This mid SUV has all the bells and whistles for a very good price. Go in and do a test drive. The second row captain seats make this vehicle super comfortable for 4 adult riders. Small adults and children can easily sit in the third row which has it's own A\/C control and USB outlet. When you fold down the third row you have a great amount of space. If you want to flip down the second row captain chairs (which you can do from the rear hatch) the space is massive. The controls are very understandable and with Infinity speakers this car has a very nice sound system. The Hyundai Bluelink for remote start, Google location search and monthly health reports make this vehicle easy to maintain and get to where you want to go. It even has Android Auto and Apple Car Play for the ultimate in getting text and replying to text messages using your voice. Bought it for my wife and she absolutely loves it.","136":"We went through the process of driving all the crossovers that compete with the Santa Fe but went with Santa Fe because of a few facts that are undisputed...\n\nOf all the Crossovers we test drove (GMC Acadia, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer and of course the Santa Fe!) this one by far had the best color choices, best warranty, top of the line safetly features and for us ranked as good as the Pilot in Driveability. It was also the most bang for your buck by a wide margin. We purchased the LTD Ultimate with the Tech package. This is similar to all the most premium models for other brands. I would say that we paid an average of $7000 less than the others which is unbelievable. The Pilot was $10,000 more for the same features!\n\nI love the sunroof that goes all the way to the 3rd row! I have never seen something like this before! I also think that Hyundai Santa Fe is by far the best looking crossover and beats all of its competitors in looks as well!","137":"...Or, let's talk about the Santa Fe Sport's poor brother\n\nDisclaimer - this is a review from a Hyundai owner for Hyundai owners. If you're looking to compare with other similar vehicles, your mileage may vary.\n\nPreviously owned - 2002 Mitsubishi Diamante, 2010 Sonata, 2013 Santa Fe Limited.\n\nIf you like me have been fascinated by Hyundai's 2013 Santa Fe (long base, not Sport), you like me have been charmed by its many qualities and irritated by its few quirks. \n\nOn the quality side - amazing design, amazing bang for the buck. Performance, acceleration - everything was pretty much as it should be. \n\nFor the 2013 model (the first of the series) though, there were a few annoying issues. To name them - a convoluted equipment level choice (you HAD to have the captain chairs on the back if you wanted a panoramic roof), and, probably the one and only real issue - a rear suspension which was too soft for its own good (probably a straight port from the shorter wheelbase Santa Fe Sport), which was ok when driving alone with a light load, but not ok at all with a full house.\n\nThis has apparently addressed prior to the 2017 model discussed here, so if you drive a 2015 for example - this might not apply to you. If you have a 2014 though, it probably does.\n\nThe other issue was that you would probably have test driven an entry level model (same engine and suspension), but once you opted for the limited you had to chime the larger wheels (19\") in, which would make the ride even harsher (why on Earth would all brands decide that \"Luxury\" rhymes with \"larger low profile tires\" is beyond me).\n\nOther than that, the 2013 Santa Fe was pure joy all the way.\n\nEnter the 2017.\nAs mentioned - it's pretty much the same, yet not the same vehicle. So I'll just point the differences:\n\n- It is very easy to mess up a good design, and just like Infiniti did it 10 years ago with the FX, Hyundai has been able to do the (few) subtle changes that changed the design for the worse between the 2016 and the 2017 models.\n\n Compared to it competition the Santa Fe is slightly narrower. In the previous versions this has been nicely compensated with a design which emphasized horizontal lines - including for the lower part of the fender and the fog lights which were horizontal. The 2017 Santa Fe Sport ALSO has horizontal fog lights, which make it look wider a wilder. Not so for the Santa Fe. The vertical fog lights (I'm quite sure someone was very proud with that choice) manage to \"close\" the horizontal line of the car's fascia and to isolate it between two vertical lines going up, making the whole vehicle look narrower and taller. \n\nAlways wondered why the 2017 Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport don't look equally dynamic seen from the front ? Now you know.\n\nOn the back, a change as subtle as inverting the position of the backup lights (on the bottom part of the taillight on the 2017 rather than on the top part in the previous models) is enough to disrupt the lines of a behind which, already by design, is heavier, and different from the perfect behind of the Santa Fe Sport and thus very, very easy to mess up.\n\nLast but not least - the absolutely perfect design of the 2013-2016 Santa Fe alloy wheels in Limited trim, combining elegance and dynamics to perfection, has been updated to a bland, smaller looking (if not smaller physically), average Joe alloy wheel design.\n\nNow that we bashed the exterior, let's enter the vehicle, shall we ? \n\nThe other reviewer's remarks about the interior's plastic put aside (I wouldn't know, have not compared with other brands), I found the 2013 dash close to perfection in design, and almost so in ergonomics. The large central volume radio button (Limited with navigation) was perfect and easy to find, and the rest was up to speed. The navigation has always been probably the most intuitive to use in the car world. \n\nSame for the huge, easy to find fan control button. The only real faux pas were the stupid Plus \/ Minus temperature control buttons, which should have always been rotary buttons (like on my 2010 Sonata, which - behold - had rotary temp control buttons but a linear Fan control button. Eeeeh... they'll get it right for my retirement year...)\n\nIn 2017, the Fan controls are the same or almost (good and bad), the radio is a banal two small rotary buttons setup (bad). The navigation and the head unit have more possibilities, but somehow the navigation screen doesn't look as clean, there is no way to switch between connected phone units while driving, little things like that.\n\nThe front seats are just as beautiful as the previous ones (very, very comfortable for whoever likes german like seats, or \"made of soft wood\", as the French call them). The seat's ventilation is genius. Beautiful thing.\n\nFinally, memory seats. The easy entry\/exit feature I'll discuss later.\n\nNow, let's drive.\n\nOr not. Apparently, space is limited. Let's see if we can add another review...","138":"Buy from a proper dealer who cares for your business, and make sure it was not a smoking Vehicle","139":"This is a good looking, roomy, well appointed SUV with plenty of room for \"cargo\" and passengers.   The two front seats are extremely comfortable...the back seats are nice and roomy but not as plush as the front seats (fold down seats never are no matter what you buy) and the third row is fine for a couple or 3 kids..adults should drive a second car if it comes down to it.   I LOVE the car...it's got 290 HP with the 6 cylinder..runs smooth and strong...power to spare if you need it.  My grandson is a baseball catcher and we go to Travel Ball tournaments all over the place and have enough space in the back for his humongous catcher's bag, a cooler,  folding chairs, a tent, and luggage for 4 on overnight trips.   I've got 28,000 miles on it with NO problems...tires are 19 inch and wearing very well.  Smooth ride, easy to enter and exit even at age 70... and I plan to keep this one!","140":"does not hold there value at all","141":null,"142":"Life with this car after purchase revealed some annoying features. So would you like to leave the sunroof open while you run in the house or store quick? Nope can't do it...you cannot turn the car off and lock it if the sunroof is open. Need to quickly close the trunk because of driving snow or rain? Nope you can't do it...you need to wait for the automatic gate to do it slowly while you wait. Did you put something in the cubby below the radio and then park the car? Good luck getting it out if it's a bulky item because the shifter will be in the way.  Do you plan to sit in the front passenger seat occasionally when you're not driving? The seat adjustment controls are nothing like the driver seat, and as a matter of fact, you'll sit a few inches lower on the passenger side.  Ever drop something between the driver seat and the center console? You'll never get it out without going in from the back seat underneath the seat because it's so narrow you can't even fit your fingertips in between there. Good luck vacuuming the carpet in these spaces because there are plenty of narrow spaces where things can fall but no ability to vacuum.  This car handles well and drives well and has a nice warranty but if you're looking for the basic comforts of a busy lifestyle with kids look somewhere else.  Hyundai needs to ask consumers where they can improve for future model redesigns.","143":"My  2015 saved us during a massive accident. An 85 year old man had his second accident of the day by pulling across out multilane divided highway at just the wrong time. We hit him at something less than the 60 mph limit and both my wife and I walked away from out totaled Santa Fe. The airbags worked so well that I didn't even have bruise marks from my glasses. The only downside is that Hyundai, and everybody else, I suppose, puts the horn button on top of the steering wheel airbag. I wonder how many other people suffer my injury: my hand-on-the-horn got blown back into my chest. It took almost two months for the pain to fully subside, and another month for my hand to regain most of its strength.\n\nTow rating was important to me. If you buy the PIO (port installed option) trailer hitch package, the Santa Fe Limited (and SE) have a 5000 lb tow rating. According to the owner's manual, even with an aftermarket hitch it is only rated for 2000 lbs. After the accident, even though the force of our connected travel trailer impact bent the \"stinger\" 90 degrees into the bumper, but the Hyundai hitch structure seemed undamaged. The impact was so severe that even the trailer was totaled.\n\nAfter the accident we had time to reflect on a replacement car. We felt so well protected by the car and had enjoyed all the features of the Ultimate package that we got the identical car in the 2016. Right away, both of us independently thought the 2016 was substantially quieter; I think they've added insulation and maybe fine tuned the suspension. \n\nI've seen a lot of negative comment about the third row seating. With the SE bench seat it might be a problem, but with the Limited's captains chairs it isn't much of a deal to get into the third row. Just for grins, my wife and I let our daughter and her 6' 5\" husband drive and we rode in the third row for a six hour day trip. Grandsons in the middle. We're both 70 y\/o and it was perfectly comfortable. Having the panoramic sun roof almost reach the third row makes it much nicer.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that Hyundai hasn't incorporated Apple's Carplay into the display system. The existing nav system is nice, but not as good as Google Maps or Apple Maps, plus I have to pay an annual $50 fee to Sirius just to get traffic information incorporated into the nav system. Carplay was supposed to begin showing up in another Hyundai model in 2015 so I figured the 2016 would definitely have it: Wrong! The BlueLink \"turn by turn guidance\", which is $100\/ year is not compatible with the navigation system. Go figure.","144":null,"145":"\"We traded in our 2014 Santa Fe Sport for the bigger 2016 Santa Fe. We love the Ultimate package.. it has everything we could ever want...with bang for the buck.We shopped for the Kia Sorento, Honda Pilot,Nissan Pathfinder and going back to Hyundai was a no brainer. We spent about 10k less than similar cars with similar packages. Owning a Hyundai today is definitely not owning a Hyundai 10 years ago..they are doing an awesome job of keeping up with the competition. I mostly drive around my kids with it..they absolutely love the captains chairs.Going grocery shopping is easy with the automatic gate lift. The navigation is easy to use. Having the AWD has been awesome in the snow. As for reliability.. My old 2014 Santa Fe Sport only went to the dealer for oil changes..never had a problem with it.. so I am very confident with this one. We have gotten many compliments on it's looks.\n\nStill going strong! I still love everything about it. It has only gone to the dealership for oil changes.","146":"Update 3\/12\/17:  The battery discharge warning issue is more persistent and annoying than ever! My original review follows. \n\nIn this review I want to focus just on the one big problem I have with my 2016 Hyundai Limited Ultimate SUV which I wish I had known about before making the purchase.  In general I agree with other reviewers that this is a good vehicle overall and a good value. It does  most things you'd expect from a modern SUV quite well. However buyers should be aware that you cannot  sit  in the vehicle and listen to the very excellent sound system in this vehicle without the engine running! If you do you will get a loud beep sound every two minutes or so along with a warning that you are discharging the battery.  This beep tone is just as loud as the music so you cannot ignore it.  So You cannot enjoy your music in this vehicle in ACC mode knowing you will be hearing this annoying beep every two minutes or so.  The dealer has  advised me that this is so you don't discharge the battery which of course is important. However why couldn't they have designed this car so that something like just listening to the radio could be done without having to run the engine?   On the side of Hyundai, if the battery does go dead there is a Lengthy restart process to get all of the technology reset back to where it was before the battery died.  I could see where this could potentially generate additional service calls, but for someone like me ( and plenty of  other folks I am sure ) who just likes to sit in their vehicle and listen to  their music on that excellent sound system this is a huge issue and unacceptable.  There are plenty of  vehicles out there with equal or more technology than this one  which do not have this problem. This is a design error on the part of Hyundai.  If  I had known this in advance I would NEVER have purchased this vehicle.   I am  NOT looking forward to the next five years of this!    Hyundai is fully aware of this issue and if it  gets enough attention  I am hoping they might take some kind of corrective action  in future models.  I am still holding out hope there may be some future firmware update from Hyundai which may resolve this issue or at least diminish it somewhat on their current offerings.  If not being able to use the radio and other accessories in this vehicle without the engine running is not an issue for you then I think you will be quite happy with this vehicle.","147":"Purchased new 2016 Santa Fe  SE AWD 8\/31\/15.  Added on the Premium Package which offers numerous features. Ride is very comfortable with 19\" tires and very positive steering. This is my first SUV, but searched the market place comparing it to other SUVs with options, price, dependability, and warranty. The Santa Fe had them beat. The 3rd seat is really for the grand kids.  The V-6  has plenty of power for expressway entry and for passing. I have heated seats and wanted air cooled seats, but Hyundai has them with an additional package including a Panoramic Roof which I didn't want or need. I wish they bundle the heated\/ cooled together.  I took a road trip and put on 5,000 miles (averaging 26mph could be better) with no problem.  During the trip stopped in El Paso Texas for an oil change. The dealer treated me very well like I was a local resident. They knew I was from another state, but that didn't matter. Hyundai has a good thing going for themselves. Time will tell how well they back their warranties.","148":"This is the third Santa Fe I have purchased and by far the best!  The comfort, ride and amenities are great.  The new Santa Fe Ultimate is larger than previous vehicles and four adults can ride comfortably.  The third row seating is great if you have little ones.  Your front seat and backseat passengers can control their own heat\/cooling, which is great - I like it warmer and others like it cooler, so everyone is happy.  Haven't had the chance to drive in the snow yet, but, if it is anything like the previous Santa Fe's, I won't have a bit of trouble.  Weather in Denver can get nasty in the winter, but the Santa Fe's have always taken on the cold and snow like a champ.  My only complaint would be the tires.  I usually replace them, as they don't seem to have the tread for winter weather; other than that, I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a larger SUV.","149":"big but not too big,  fabulous acceleration, great price,","150":"I believe this car is the best value, most overlooked, and totally underrated in the three row segment.  It is smooth, quiet, has a nice V6 engine, the interior ergonomics are well thought out, and it is pretty solid to drive.  The cargo space is extremely usable.  I have owned Honda's, Acura's, and Volvo's.  This is by far my favorite car I have ever owned.  There are really only a few things that I do not love about the car.  The headlights are not very good, even with the HID's from the factory.  I upgraded to a better bulb which helped but sideward visibility could be better.  I think they may have fixed this for 2017.  I wish the transmission shifted a little quicker and crisper.  It's a little to laxed for my taste but it's not so frustrating that I hate the car.  I wish the engine was tuned for a little more low end torque rather than high end horsepower.  This would help with everyday fuel economy which is about average.  Lastly I think visibility around the side mirrors and A pillars is sub par.  Having driven Acura's and Honda's forever they really have that down.  Otherwise the car is an exceptional value for the money and the recent 2017 refresh makes it even stronger.  This car will be overlooked by many because it's a Hyundai.  I took a lot of grief from people for going from an Acura to a Hyundai.  Then they ride in it and are blown away.  It is truly 95% of the car for about 75% of the cost if you shop around.   It really has changed my whole impression of Hyundai.","151":"This car is mainly my wife's car. We both really enjoy driving the vehicle as it is fun and comfortable, but riding in the passenger seat gets uncomfortable pretty shortly. I have noticed several others here on this site have complained about the passenger front seat. Some of which have helped the discomfort of it by placing a cushion on the seat, my wife also sits on a cushion while riding in that seat while I am driving.  I have tried using the same cushion while riding in that seat but find it to be very annoying and do not find it to work very well for me. \n\nOur big issue is that when you spend the kind of money required to purchase this type of vehicle you should not have to purchase a seat cushion, or be uncomfortable while riding on the passenger seat, and\/or expect  your spouse or other passenger to ride uncomfortably. \n\nThis is not our first Santa Fe, in fact this is the 5th Santa Fe we have owned and none of the others have had this problem with the front passenger seat. Hyundai should realize this is an issue and resolve it, please! I don't know exactly what the answer would be to fix the problem, maybe they could attach another base etc. to the seat that is already in the vehicles to give them more height, I don't know for sure but I am sure that Hyundai has some engineers that could find a fix for the problem. I sure hope they have made changes to the passenger seat for the 2016 models.","152":"This is my 3rd Santa Fe, my last was a 2006 GLS. The exterior styling makes this SUV stand out in the segment. I was amazed at the high level of interior quality and the standard features in this model. My ONLY complaints are the small glove compartment and that the height of the front passenger seat is too low and not adjustable. I remedied this by installing a front seat cushion (made for automobiles) for my wife. There are plenty of interior storage places. I like the storage bin under the rear floor that also includes a roll up storage compartment cover.\n\nThe ride is very comfortable. The engine is quiet, very powerful and works well with the transmission. The middle row and rear seats are easy to lower and the floor is virtually flat. It's a vast improvement over earlier models where I had to remove the 2nd row head rests to lower the seats.  I make frequent trips to a home improvement store and it's hauled everything I load into it. I really like the A\/C vents for the middle row seats and the heating and A\/C controls for the rear. seats.\n\nThe best car I ever owned.","153":"I went from a 2011 Buick Enclave to the Santa Fe.  It's the perfect size for us.  I like the looks, comfort, overall performance and economy.  Road noise somewhat greater and road comfort not up to the Enclave.  However the real annoyance is the front passenger seat is not height adjustable , this is a real problem for my wife.  In fact had she ridden in the car before leasing it, we would not have leased it.   I've ridden in the seat also and agree with her, it's annoying and neither of us are short people.  She sits on a cushion when we travel....can't understand the design not including height adjustment.  \nThe other shortfall is the nav. system....we loved the OnStar system in the Buick.  This one is OK, but not nearly as user friendly as the OnStar.","154":"It is one of the better 3 row crossovers in the segment.Smooth ride,great handling,refined engine and transmission.Reliable electronics and cool features such as  panaromic sunroof,Heated and cooled seats,heated rear 2nd row seats,smart liftgate and good comfort overall.If there are some weak points it has to do the front seats not height adjustable(my spouse doesn't like it),Brakes not so effective especially under full load and suspension that bottoms out under full load of passengers.","155":"I shopped them all.  Price, within reason, was not an issue.  I really like this SUV a lot.  It rides well, it's quick for a heavy vehicle, it has every feature out there that I wanted, and it seems bulletproof so far.  In mixed driving I got 24.4 MPG in the first thousand miles.  Love the way it looks, the huge sunroof, the power lift gate, the sliding driver seat, the onboard computer control, the solid feel when driving ... Just everything about this vehicle is excellent.","156":"I owned a 2014 Santa Fe Limited for 3 days.  I was t-boned at an intersection, resulting in all but the front air bags deploying and the rear axel snapping in two.  The EMS at the scene kept repeating to me that the air bags and design of the Santa Fe saved my life.  I replaced that Santa Fe with a 2015 Santa Fe Limited Ultimate.\r\n\r\nI had been driving Chevy Tahoes since 1999.  This Santa Fe is a breath of fresh air! It drives like a dream, holds the road well, and the safety features are awesome.  I greatly prefer the navigation system to OnStar.  \r\n\r\nI will be replacing all my company vehicles with Santa Fe's as needed.","157":"i owned a 2011 Santa Fe limited awd and traded for this same model 2015. It's incredible. Everything is laid out really well. I enjoyed the captains chairs for the second row and the third row. I really think the panoramic sunroof is a great feature. However, the most important aspect is the drivability. I would say that the ride is a little stiffer than the previous Santa Fe, but it is miles of an improvement in terms of overall ride quality and luxury feel of the vehicle. I would highly recommend the Santa Fe. ","158":"I traded a CR-v for this Sante Fe.   The CR-V was much more solid, with absolutely no rattles.  From day one, the Sante Fe has had a very annoying rattle in the back end which I cannot locate.  Road noise is more noticeable in this vehicle than in others I have owned.   I am very disappointed.\n\nUpdate:  As of August 2016, I surprisingly still own this vehicle.  Other than the item noted above, there has been only one additional issue.   The molding above the rear passenger window has developed an annoying leak.  Although water does not enter the vehicle, the leak seems to contain some oily or sticky liquid which leaves the window and the door marked and which requires constant cleaning.\n\nUpdate as of Feb. 2017. - After a little more than 2 years, things have settled down a bit.  The rattle mentioned previously is less noticeable and the window area leak is also not as prevalent.  All in all, I like the car.  I especially like the way it handles (steering) and the pick up it has.  Given the number of issues that most new cars have these days, I'd have to say that I am satisfied.  It would be nice if the paint quality was better.","159":"Love the new 2017 Sorento. We now own two Sorentos and have been thoroughly pleases. The 1st one's features and dependability is the reason we purchased the 2nd one. Would recommend this vehicle highly.","160":"We have now owned our Sorento EX Touring v6 for almost exactly one year.   It is simply an amazing car, rock solid in 22k miles.  I have owned Audi, Infiniti, multiple Porsches... And this car's refinement is as good or better, hard to believe.    We cross shopped the XC90, GL 450 and this has all the features we wanted at literally half the price!  We rented a loaded Volvo for a week and couldn't wait to give it back, so many minor annoyances.    Kia is tops with CR and JD Power, and the safety features are top shelf.   If you have a family, you simply have to test drive a Sorento.  Tons of safety features, powerful v6, super comfortable ride and whisper quiet cabin.  Much quieter than the XC90, 7db quieter than the Q7.  Put up the rear sunshades and your toddler will be out in no time !   I honestly don't know know they are making money at the prices these are selling for.     Lastly I will say this,  the Sorento and Cayenne sit side by side in our garage.  If one of us needs a car..... with or without kids, the Kia gets chosen 100pcnt of the time.  Porsches are incredible machines - that's the highest complement I can give the Kia. It is the closest thing to a perfect CUV you will find.","161":"The 2017 Sorento is a great SUV. I have the LX AWD model and it has everything that I need. Love the Apple CarPlay. I have had it for a year now and I still look forward to taking trips in it. This is my 3rd Kia, and while the reliability of the other 2 was great, the quality of materials and fit and finish in this one is much better than in the past. The Sorento should NOT be overlooked when shopping for SUV's.","162":"Great ride, very quiet.  Handling is good but if quick acceleration is your thing go for the v6.  The vehicle has the feel inside of a much more expensive car and you can really tell it when you shut the door- very quiet.  This car has the best warranty in the business and the overall impression of this vehicle is very positive.","163":"Test-drive similar models of luxury SUVs, then give this Kia a spin. Excellent value for the money.","164":"This Kia is everything you could ask for. It is comfortable. Quite. Classy looking. And most of all I feel safe in it. They have done a great job with all the safety features. It has excellent power and all the controls are easy to see and get to. You won't be disappointed with this Kia !","165":"Owned the 2017 KIA SXL 2 weeks now. Traded in a 2015 Toyota Highlander Limited. This was the second Highlander we've owned before trading. First of all the KIA has twice the warranty of the Highlander, This Kia is not a cheap car, in fact, I could have bought a comparable Highlander for about the same monies. But this KIA is every bit the vehicle the Highlander was, in fact, I'm more impressed with its quality build.","166":"I intended to buy the 5 passenger Turbo 4. I drove one and it was excellent. This vehicle is for my wife and it was difficult to find a 5 pass , turbo 4 that had all the \" needs \" on her list. The dealer made me an offer I couldn't turn down on this 7 pass , V-6 and we are extremely pleased. The most difficult thing about senior citizens like us when buying a car is learning all the new features especially the audio \/ navigation and electronics. We owned the car for 4 weeks and have put 1200 miles on it. Our last trip was 386 miles of interstate and mountain driving. We got 27 MPG on this trip,","167":"Bought the 2017 EX with Tech and Touring packages two months ago.  Didn't get navigation, since Apple navigation Maps will show on display if Iphone plugged in.  (But Waze is not compatable).  I  like that I can use Bluetooth, so I can use Siri for calls, emails etc. without picking up the Iphone. Car verbal commands will play AM and FM stations, but will not recognize commands for XM stations -- instead it goes to FM station (strange). Good handling in twisting roads; I like power, acceleration and downshifting for Colorado mountains.  DON'T  like the electronic steering!  I'm used to hydraulic steering where once you get it \"on tract\" it stays there even if you touch the wheel either way.  With the KIA on highway at 60+ mph, you have to constantly make micro adjustments to the wheel to get it back to neutral.  No it's not alignment.  3 dealers have done alignments and it's perfect.  One dealer said that's just the way electronic steering  and other new cars are to save weight and for fuel economy.  KIA: Thanks for making those saving and the expense of easy driving.  (I wonder if Audi and BMW steer this way).  So drive it on straight  highway at 60+ and see if it bothers you before buying.","168":"you get a lot for the money w\/ the premium and touring packages.  actually, you get a lot for the money for the vehicle.  good acceleration.  smooth ride.  decent noise suppression.  would have liked the opportunity to purchase the EX w\/out the third row seating (and have that be additional storage).  excellent mileage for an suv.","169":"This Sedona did not come with your safety and comfort in mind. First of all you cannot have the recirculated air on at the same time as your fan. So you have to endure car exhaust fumes if you take any trip. Second which is even worse, the seats are uncomfortable for traveling and there is no remedy for that because you cannot use a cushion or seat cover. If you use a seat cover or a thin pad, no matter how much you weigh it turns off your airbags making your safety at risk. This was not a smart deal. I called Kia to find out how to turn the airbag on at all times. They said you will just have to live with it.","170":"My wife and I just got the 2017 Kia Sorento SX V6 loaded with options and we absolutely love this crossover.  The refinement and driving feel is luxury car like and it's so comfortable and quiet on the road.  We have driven Lexus, BMW and Acura and this vehicle is just as good if not better in many ways, especially for the price. Time will tell with reliability but so far we are in love with this great car.","171":"I had only driven Hondas for the past 17 years.  Kia has won me over!  This vehicle has everything I could ask for, with a 10 year warranty and a great price!    I couldn't be happier!","172":"A KIA had not been on my radar screen, but I was very impressed with the Sorento's look, feel, and handling.  Additionally, I liked the 10 year warranty.  I only have 650 miles on the car, but I have enjoyed the ride and enjoy the added features this car comes with.","173":"Nothing negative from my vehicle so far.The most impressive is the engine.Almost 300 hp propels this SUV down the road quickly and effortlessly.At 80 mph it is barley working.Ride and quiet much improved.I owned a 2012 and a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe and the improvements in the 2017 Sonota are very apparent.Gas milage at 75 mph is about 25.5. I would expect thirty at speed limits.Regular gas no problem.We love it and cant wait for our first road trip.","174":"Purchased First KIA, 2017 Sorrento 11miles because of the look of the body and safety reports. Took it for a road trip and it handled the rain, first winter snow  and slush very well. One thing I was not happy about was the passenger seat indicator did not come on when the passenger took there seat belt off. This is a safety issue in which should come equipped in all vehicles. The seat belts didn't have much resistance when the breaks was given a lot of force to stop. Very happy about the many air bags. In which I am having the dealer take a look at ASAP. I love the Sorrento very smooth ride and great on GAS. Do not care for the satellite to much, The signal is not good. The radio system is great with my Teenager as well as the USB hook ups.","175":"I purchased it from Fette Kia and everything was great. The dealer and sales rep both were very accommodating.    I'm very impressed with the Kia brand. they have definitely come a long way. I've always been a Honda fan but decided to give Kia a try because I was getting all the things i wanted the 6cyl - AWD the convenience package for a very good lease. they worked with my budget.","176":"After shopping also shopping the Highlander, Pilot, and CX-9, we found the Sorento to be the most comfortable, quietest, and second-best handling and looking. (The CX-9 was our top choice in those categories.) When you added in the fantastic warranty, the strong CR reliability ratings, and the zero APR, the Sorento was a no-brainer for us. We opted for the SX with the Advanced Technology package and couldn't be happier. Highly recommended.","177":"Amazing value. Traded in my BMW for financial reasons and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and overall ownership experience. Absolutely love this vehicle. Rock solid in every way.","178":"I've got about 1500 miles on my new Sorento so far, and there are SO many things that I love about it.  It seems to be a great value, a very comfortable car for the  money.  There are some items that make me scratch my head: The so-called third seat...REALLY?  That is crazy in every SUV I have been in.  Give it up, people.  If you want a third row, get a mini-van.  For the Sorento, getting that third row not only gives you a couple of seats that only an 8-year old could sit in, it also loses you some handy storage bins!  How stupid!  Another poorly designed feature is the power rear hatch.  The Sorento has a great feature that allows the hatch to raise just by approaching the car...that is cool.  What is NOT cool is that the hatch will open up while you are in the garage and then bang your hatch into your garage door.  If that happens (say, your fob button gets pressed by your other keys), then you go out to the garage and open your garage door, causing hundreds of dollars of damage!  This is not a problem with only the Sorento, but I never thought of it until I owned an SUV.  Beware!  A feature that I am having trouble with is the Automatic Forward Braking system.  It's supposed to monitor traffic ahead and warn you or apply the brakes if needed to lessen a collision.  A great safety feature...that turns off dozens of times each trip...about once every four miles!  Accompanied by a \"ding ding!\" I feel like it's going to be Christmas all year round!  It's going back to the shop tomorrow, so we'll see if they fix it or not.  My next whine is the leather seat warmers.  Why would the switch have to be engaged every time I start my car??  And why have a switch that requires multiple taps to cycle through the options, instead of a two-or-three position switch?  My other cars with this feature have an Off-Low-High toggle switch, and when you a running errands the heater comes on to the last setting.  But the Sorento has to be turned on each time, and then you have to push the button repeatedly to go from high to medium to low heat.  Now, after that list of complaints, I still LOVE how it drives.  A powerful engine (a little too touchy on the gas pedal), smooth tranny and ride, tight turning radius, great visibility.  I am happy, but I do wish those things on my list were not so puzzling.  Another oddity about KIA is that accessories cost twice as much if you wait to get them after the sale.  Seems to me that a posted price for an accessory should be the same whether the item is installed at the dealer or at the port.  \n\nAnd another thing???  Hire someone who actually knows English to write your owner's manuals!\n\nUPDATE:  The Forward Braking problem is already a service advisory from KIA.  So the good news is they are on top of it.  The bad news is the fact that it was not done properly to begin with, and now the part is on order.  I'll update this again as the repair process proceeds.","179":"Leased this SUV for 3 years this past week. I choose the snow white pearl with merlot leather interior. I traded 2 other vehicles in for this one as my wife and I didn't need 2 since we are retired. I have leased over 20 vehicles in the past 20 years including BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Lexus. The Sorento is one of the best vehicles I have ever leased. I have the SX with Advanced Technology package which includes Lane Departure Warning, Advanced smart cruise control, Forward Collision Warning Autonomous  Emergency Warning and Electronic Parking Brake. I added remote start and Home link rear view mirror. The build quality is exceptional, doors close with a solid thud like the German cars, and interior quality is as good or better than Lexus RX350. Interior noise levels are exceptionally low with no tire hiss being heard in the rain which makes listening to the very good 10 speaker Infinity sound system even better. Heated and ventilated front seats are great along with the heated steering wheel. The 3rd row isn't that roomy but I will probably not use it that much but cargo room behind the second row is very good. If you will use the 3rd row often this may not be your best choice. Reliability isn't known yet since I only have 650 miles on the SUV. I hope this helps anyone looking to purchase an suv.","180":"This is a beautiful SUV standing or going down the road, great features, interior and exterior finish is a class above. Quiet and smooth. 3.3l V6 has some true bite to it when called upon. This is an excellent vehicle for the price! Already looking ahead to 2018 for a new one..","181":"Great SUV.  Beautiful in and out. Excellent quality, performance, design, features, room, comfort, warranty.  Great Value Too!","182":"Our first Sorento was an LX back in 2012 then we traded for a 2014 EX V6 and just last week traded that one for a 2017 Limited.  The wife loves the fact that the Sorento can be outfitted with 3rd row seats and I love the features for the price, notwithstanding great dealer support and warranty.  Our previous Sorento's have always been dependable.  I almost traded our 2014 for the 2016 but it was the 1st year of the re-tooling and dealers were getting MSRP pricing plus it didn't have auto braking with the front collision warning system.  Our dealer had a great price on a brand new 2017 limited and we traded.  I chose the limited for several reasons: to get some of the same features our 2014 EX had (such as ventilated front seats) we had to go to the limited trim.  But I also liked all the other features the limited offered so we chose this trim level.  You can't get any additional options on this trim level as they are all included, except for any extra dealer options (like a cargo net, mats, etc).  There are a number of great features on this car.  To begin with, the sound deadening glass and underbody makes for a really quite highway ride.  The interior redesign is very functional.  The power seat on drivers side has many new features on lumbar support and leg extension support at front of seat.  The LCD display and Navigation\/Audio\/Bluetooth\/Climate displays are much more user friendly.  It seems there are on-screen prompts to almost all functions to help you.  The audio system is outstanding.  The menu choices have been broadened and are extensive: you can download Yelp, Pandora is included, SirusXM Traffic, Apple Car Play and Android Auto just to mention a few.  You still have the UVO system (download POI's you create on your own Smartphone or PC and Parking Minder).  We love the new Android Auto.  You hook up your phone via USB and you basically have Google maps and voice support at your command via the car's system. The Lane change warning is a nice feature.  You still have Blind Spot monitor which we loved on our 2014.  Adaptive Cruise control is really neat.  You set your cruise speed and if you come up on a slower vehicle your vehicle automatically adjusts its speed to the vehicle ahead until you move out of the lane and pass which time your car goes back to the speed you originally set.  The surround view cameras give you front views, backup camera with obstacle warning and cameras on underside of each outside mirror give a computer generated image of a birds eye view of your car.  This is nice when parking in a tight space you can see on the screen how you are fitting between two cars or other obstacles.  There is an electric parking brake on the Limited which automatically releases as you drive forward.  There is also a feature called Auto Hold which when activated allows you to take your foot off the brake when waiting in a line of cars at a light or a stop sign.  Once you come to a complete stop the \"auto hold\" holds your car just as if you have your foot on the brake, but you can relax your foot and as you step on the accelerator to move forward it automatically releases (part of the electric parking brake system).  The full ceiling panorama roof remains a great feature.  And of course with the 2017 model you have auto braking in advance of a frontal collision situation.  Haven't tested out that yet as no way to really simulate it in a situation without risking it not \"seeing\" the potential frontal crash.  You also have 1 USB connection port and 2 additional USB charging ports as well as 3 12v ports and one 110v port. Sunshades are on the 2nd row windows, the V6 is the only engine to go with in my opinion, and in the Limited you have heated\/cooled front seats and heated 2nd row seats as well as a heated steering wheel.  Yes I know that is a lot of features which some are just 'luxury' items, but at $46,000 MSRP with most dealers discounting off that, you would be hard pressed to find another vehicle with V6 and 3rd row seats with all those features at such a good price.","183":"My Wife and I just purchased this Kia Sorento V6 AWD with the SX trim level in a beautiful red.  This was a demonstrator with about 2800 miles on it so we got a great discount from the $45,000+ price.  We originally were talking with the dealer about a lower EX trim level model but we were able to negotiate for this higher trim level at about the same price as the lower EX trim because it was a demonstrator.  This is a fantastic car with the safety and technology packages on it.  One of the coolest features is the smart cruise control which maintains the distance from the car in front of you even down to a full stop.  The lane keeping alert is also very helpful.  The UVo voice activation feature is nice so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to tune the radio or make a call.  The ride is very comfortable and quiet even on rough roads and at high Interstate speeds.  The leather power seats have multi position adjustments which are quite comfortable and these happen to be heated and cooled.  The only nitpick is that there is no daytime running lights feature and the lights don't come on automatically with the wipers.  Kia engineers should fix this.  Otherwise this car is great.  It gets high ratings from Consumer Reports, Kelly Blue Book and J D Power.  The Kia warranty is an industry leader.  The value Kia puts in this vehicle is tremendous.  The features on this car can be had on vehicles twice the price.  This is the first NEW car we have had in our 40 year marriage and we are very satisfied with it.","184":"I have owned several [6] suv's in the past 12 years. all were 4 cyl  this is my 2nd sorento. the 2015 model was very good, but this is better.","185":"I did my research and test drove almost every mid-size SUV under $50,000. After a year of looking, I kept coming back to the Kia Sorento SX Limited AWD. It fits my needs like a glove made just for me. It's sporty, sexy, luxurious yet still has the power to tow 5,000 lbs and cargo space to help a friend move or bring lumber home from the hardware store. The Sorento has the best turning diameter out of all the SUVs - do a donut (slowly, of course) and feel the difference it makes turning into a parking space! I'm a little short and if I had two wishes to make it better - it would be to reduce the height of getting in and out of the vehicle and changing the driver's seat headrest, minor details for such an amazing SUV.","186":"This 2017 KIA replaces my 2012 KIA and is much improved over the 2012. The 2012 is the very first 4 cylinder that I had ever purchased and it exceeded my expectations for performance particularly speed increase. The 2017 is every bit as good if not better.","187":"Well Worth the Money and RIVERSIDE KIA was Amazing  and they were great to deal with, so with that said:                                                                                                                                                                          PROS: Many PROS LIKE PRICE AND WARRANTY, STYLING IS VERY NICE, interior is pretty nice for the price, Headroom is good as I am 6' and it works well with my daughters car-seat :-)  It has pretty good storage room but but could use a little more :-)                                                                                                                                        CONS: A 3\" SCREEN for Radio and CONTROLS ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!  You cannot see the screen most of the time due to the angle and glare from the sun\/window it is HORRIBLE and I MEAN HORRIBLE come on KIA you can due much better then this!!!  The sound system is OK nothing to brag about!                                                                                     ANOTHER BIG CON IS NO AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS and I forget to shut them off all the time thinking they will off automatically like most other older cars and most if not all NEW Cars!  ANOTHER VERY POOR CHOICE ON KIA'S PART!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                  FUEL ECONOMY is not that great right off the bat as I got the car with 8 miles on it and it now has over 600 but not over 700!  I really have to watch what I am doing driving  wise to get 19\/20 around the city.   I got the SUV on 8\/31\/2016 so most of my driving is around the city as I am retired :-)                                                                         I REALLY LIKE THE SORENTO DESPITE MY CONS, WHICH MANLY ARE PET PEEVES AND KIA SHOULD HAVE DONE A LITTLE BETTER IN THESE AREA!","188":"My 2014 EX was a big jump up from my 2011 EX.  My 2017 is an even bigger jump!!  Great looking in and out!  Drive is smooth and (mostly) quiet.  Mostly everything has been improved over my 2014 (which I loved) except a couple of things.  First, my 2014 was 100% free of squeaks, rattles, vibrations...noise.  My 2017 has a couple of rattles on bumpy roads that can get a bit annoying.  I get rattles with the sunroof but on very bumpy roads the rattles become vibrations and then it's very disappointing...like various sections of the roof get loud vibrations...kind of kills the ride.  I also get a little bit of rattle coming from around where the center console meets the dash board.  I took everything out of the car like coins, phone\/GPS wires, other stuff to make sure it was not any of my loose stuff.  Although not consistent...I did get rattles from that section on bumpy roads.  So that \"noise\" is also disappointing and kind of ruins the ride...when it occurs.  Everything else is fantastic with this car.  I thought the 2014 was a little small (aesthetically) for my 6'4\" tall frame...a little girly is how I put it.  But, this 2017 which is only a few inches longer feels like it fits me much better and I feel great (cool) driving such a nice car that also seems manly for me to drive...while still being very stylish.  This car looks great from all angles inside and out...very proud to drive it and be seen driving it.  Except for the rattles...all other fit-and-finish seems high quality!  Materials are all good.  Everything is like you'd find on a more expensive model\/brand....dear I say mid-entry level Mercedes.  The only thing knocking this car down a peg or two is the rattles and vibrations...which is a big deal to me...especially since my 2014 had none.  I also noticed that my cargo area doesn't seem to be as wide as my 2014.  I would get my mountain bike and my dog crate side-by-side easily into my 2014.  My 2017 those two items are squeezed right up next to each other...seems a few inches narrower than my 2014.  On the other hand, it seems the cargo is a little deeper so that helps.  Also, even though the 2017 V6 drives great (better than '14)...I do think that since it is heavier than the '14...Kia should seriously think about upping the V6 power by about 25hp and maybe get a 7 or 8 speed automatic like the competitors are doing.  I do think my back up camera parking assist guides are not calibrated like my '14 was.  I could drive my '14 backwards all over town just by looking at my dash video...the guides were very accurate.  I knew if my guide lines were touching anything on my camera then I knew my car wasn't going to hit anything.  It was excellent for parking backwards in tight spots and getting out of tight spots...I relied on it a lot...TRUSTED it!  My '17 guideline seem off so I really have to rely on my mirrors to see the parking lines and be extra careful.  If I just followed my camera I'd likely side-swipe cars parked next to me.  The camera lines don't match up with the real parking lines...so that isn't cool.  Might have to ask my dealer about that.  So, overall, I'd give my 2017 a 4.5 stars and not a 5 because of the occasional rattles\/vibrations (Kia should have ironed out for the 2017) and the backup camera guides aren't calibrated well...not as easy to park or get out of tight spaces as my '14.   Otherwise...I LOVE my 2017 EX V6 Sorento!!","189":"I did a lot of homework before my purchase.  By far the Sorento has the best quality, interior, and technology.  The navigation and blue tooth are very user friendly.  In addition, the vehicle is so so quiet, it is hard to believe as there are extra insulation and acoustic glass.  Kia engineers hit a home run on the build quality.  The more I  drive this vehicle the more I really enjoy it and can appreciate such great quality.  Even the electric steering has great road feel, since Kia placed the motor on the steering rack.  This is the first Kia I have owned and I never thought I would buy a Kia, but I am sold now.  Kia hired an engineer from Audi and he has really upped the quality.  I would put this crossover up against Lexus any day of the week.  The front seats are very comfortable and supportive so you do not get driver fatigue.  You will not be disappointed and you must include this vehicle on your short list if you are in the market.","190":"We compared several mid sized SUV's by test driving and pricing them out with similar features\/packages and the Kia was the best value that we found.  We were also very impressed with the ride and the safety features (autonomous braking, lane monitoring, blind spot monitoring and a great back up camera).    The basics of the vehicle are great as well - a smooth and surprisingly quiet ride and solid acceleration with the 3.3 V6.","191":"NOTE IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING TOWING WITH A 2017 SORENTO --- 2016 Kia Sorento AWD 6-cylinder with tow package: towing capacity 5000 lbs with tongue weight 500 lbs (Owner's Manual p. 5-104). 2017 Kia Sorento AWD 6-cylinder with tow package: towing capacity 5000 lbs with tongue weight 350 lbs (Owner's Manual p. 5-113). Separately, you might also be interested to know that to change the oil it is necessary to first remove a cover plate with 17 bolts before you can access the oil drain plug. Consequently, most will end up hacksawing an access hole in the cover.","192":"Assembled here with US engine and US transmission. Best warranty in the market that I have seen. Rides and handles well. Slightly underpowered accelerating onto highway smoothly with 4 cylinder standard engine. Smallish rear window.","193":"My new Sorento SX is loaded with goodies and I love it.  The goodies are better designed and easier to operate than my Wife's new Lexus LS460.  The nav. is much more \"Americanized\".  The ONLY PROBLEM that I have is, I'm a big guy and the driver's seat if very uncomfortable due to the very hard bolsters.  They are very hard and gives me hip pain when I sit in the seat.  After much searching, I found a cushion  that makes it much more comfortable to drive.  It takes a little more effort to get seated as I have to try to adjust the cushion when I get in.  I guess they design these seats for small Korean folks with small butts.  If you have a large rear end, ya better be careful before buying this car.","194":"The V6 is very responsive.  In general, the car feels sturdier and more solid than previous years.  Gas mileage is better even though it is a V6 - averaging between 24 and 25 mpg.  Great car, good value.","195":"We liked vehicle, but had problem from start of lease with poor shifting at 40-50 range. All dealer would respond is that no computer errors show.","196":"Loaded with safety features , rides and handles good , so far 19mpg (only 350 miles) plenty of luggage space","197":"Overall, I think it is a great car, but it has one MAJOR flaw that upsets me.  Being designed in Korea, most of the folks there are small and those seat bolsters hold them in place nicely I'm sure.  Due to cancer meds, I have gained some weight and no longer have a little butt and as such the seat bolsters are very hard and jab me in the hips making it very uncomfortable.  I didn't notice this during the test drive, but after the purchase and the 100 mile drive home I realized that I had made a bad decision to purchase this auto.  If you don't have a big rear end, then this is a great car, but if your behind is above average, I suggest you not purchase this car.  KIA should make the bolsters softer so that they don't jab a person in the hips.  I mentioned the discomfort to the dealer and they indicated that they were sorry.UPDATE:  while not perfect, the seat feels much better. Just don't have a big butt!","198":"Make sure they are happy with a slightly smaller 3 row SUV.  It is driving great.  Only minor issue is that a side view mirror popped out when I was folding it in.  I was able to easily replace it.  It doesn't pop out if I'm careful when I fold it in and make sure not to touch the mirror itself.","199":"Third row carpet seam is easily visible and staples show even around the carpet mat.  2nd row would be better with captain chairs.  There is not a lot of space to get into the back row seats.","200":"Kia has outdone themselves with new Sorento. It's a perfect size crossover - huge trunk in 5 seater configuration and always available fairly comfortable 3rd row to haul up to 7 adults. Very blunt front and rear minimize exterior dimensions to assist in parking, while providing the same interior dimensions as much larger Highlander. Comfort on the top trim SXL is rivaling premium crossovers from Japanese and American carmakers. Compare Sorento with Lexus RX, Lincoln MKX or Acura MDX and you will find that Sorento matches them feature by feature, seat comfort, road noise isolation, technology and ride. All while costing $10K less MSRP. Considering that KIA & dealers are also providing very aggressive discounts from MSRP, you can easily save $15K by forgoing the prestige brand logo. Sorento's Adaptive Cruise Control is also considerably better then competition - keeping distance reliably and supporting full stop & go traffic where most of the competition cuts out below 15mph. Ride quality is excellent - assertive, yet soft enough to forget road imperfections. Acceleration for V6 Direct injection engine matched with 6-speed automatic is excellent too. Starting up hill or overtaking cars on the highway is piece of cake. Fuel consumption could be better, but at least the listed specs are very conservative. My V6 AWD trim is rated 17\/23\/19 combined and so far in the first 9,000 miles of mixed driving with plenty of traffic and AC on I am averaging 21mpg. 2017 model adds Adaptive headlamps that swivel in the curves to provide better illumination and Autonomous Emergency Breaking that keeps an eye on the traffic ahead and will apply brakes automatically if it feels that collision is imminent. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also come standard and greatly enhance available infotainment system. Otherwise 2017 is indistinguishable from 2016 redesign model. Huge panoramic sunroof goes beyond second row of seats and provides great sky views for passengers in all rows. My only pet peeve with it is that it is controlled by single lever. So if you want to just open blind, but leave the sunroof closed, you can't. Once you push the button to open the blind, the roof starts to open automatically and you need to go back and forth to achieve what you want. Another perplexing omission in US is absence of DRLs. There is an LED brow light on Sorento that acts as DRL in all regions outside US, but in US it is can not be turned on without full headlight. So you either drive with your lights off, or you need to turn on main headlights. It's a mystery why KIA decided to disable this feature in US.","201":"A very comfortable, quite, well mannered SUV.  I get better than EPA mileage, and the car is very quiet on the road.  Very comfortable seats with plenty of adjustment for even this back surgery veteran.  The 4 has all the power you need for today's driving for the average driver but won't win any races...if you find yourself in that position, go off road!  Lots of storage space in back.  Update:  had to drive the new car a 1200 trip unexpectedly and we got as high as 30 mph on the AWD 4 cyl.   It appears city driving around 24 and 28-29 hwy...I'm still extremely pleased.","202":"Does have blind spots.  Seems to have some air leaks that make it noisy on road trips.  Handling is great.  Turns are sharp.  Bluetooth connection works great.  Offers Sirrus.","203":"This model comes with lots of extras, but each one seems a unique mix.","204":"My wife and I where rearended at a stop light and our Kia's bumpers held up to the blow. It just split the bumper in one spot and did nothing to the frame or alignment I can't give this car enough stars!!!","205":"I have a 2016 Kia, EX-V6, leather seats, etc. and front wheel drive.  What a great car.  On the highway, I have averaged as high as 34mpg driving at 70mph.  The acceleration is excellent, comfort it great, interior close to perfect.  I have the 3rd row seating, yes, a bit tight, but still useable.  The only thing that should have I done was to have bought the AWD option.  But with only FWD, the car handles well in the snow.  This is my second Sorento. The Sorento is close to perfect for my needs.  Just a side note - I also have the 2017 Sportage, LX, AWD.  That too is an excellent vehicle, especially in the Lake Effect Snow Region of Pennsylvania.","206":"Sold a 2014 ford flex that rattled like a war wagon kia is quieter and built better,have owned 14 months no trips back to dealer for repairs ,will buy more.","207":"2016 sorento with 25000 miles  (bought new 2015)  The overall performance is very good but the steering is awful. When your going straight down the road and you move the wheel a very small amount there is resistance then you feel a click type release. The car moves quickly in that direction and you have to move the wheel back, this makes it dangerous to drive at 60-65 mph. Kia told the dealer they have had some complaints of this but no fix.       MY LAST KIA____FIX THAT   Joe","208":"Very well taken care of","209":"Goal was to find a reliable, well appointed, 3 row, mid-sized AWD SUV to replace a 2000 Honda Odyssey (200K miles).  After considerable research I narrowed the search to a 2016 Kia Sorento 3.3V EX (with premium packages),SX\/SXL and the 2015\/16 Toyota Highlander XLE. Test drove both a 2016 Kia Sorento EX and a 2015 Toyota Highlander XLE within minutes of each other. Was surprised that the 2016 Kia Sorento had the better ride as well as safety features not available on the 2016 Toyota Highlander. Now with new car prices over $40K sought out to find a under 20k mile used\/certified vehicle. Again Kia had the edge here since the 2nd owner receives the balance of the 5 year, 60K bumper-to-bumper warranty vs the Highlander 3 year, 36K mile warranty. Wanted to be sure that MPG gas mileage was equal\/better that 2000 Honda Odyssey 21 mpg. Government gas mileage ratings for both cars were very close overall - 19 Kia\/20 Highlander. Was fortunate to find a used 2016 Kia Sorento SXL AWD.  I am pleased to report that after 9 months and 11,000 miles of driving our Kia Soretno SXL the overall mpg is to 24.5. On a long trip from Boston to Washington D.C. the 2016 Sorento averaged an incredible 32 mpg in both directions.  As for the features love the incredibly quiet and smooth ride, large back-up camera, wife's favorite is the heaated steering wheel for cold winter morning driving. side mirror land departure sensors, heated and cooled seats (front & back), no hands tailgate lift, small turning ratio. Everyday I drive am more and more pleased with this vehicle purchase.","210":"There is a lot to like about the 2017 Kia Sorento.  Unfortunately, the seats are really hard and uncomfortable.  After owning the car x 2 weeks.  I'll never buy another Kia!","211":"The value the Sorento offers is amazing. You really get a lot for the money when buying. However the biggest problem with KIA is the resale. We bought ours one year old with 20 thousand miles on it. It already took the big deprecation hit. A new highlander or pilot will be much better if you buy new and plan on selling in a few years. They also cost more out of the box. We have no intention on selling so resale isn't a big concern to us.   First I'll start with the engine. It is plenty powerful. We live in the south so we got the front wheel drive model. It really is overpowered for the front wheels. If it kicks down a few gears it will torque steer. Fuel mileage has been as expected. We average 23mpg between a mix of city and highway.  One of my biggest gripes are the brakes. When I am doing a lot of city driving the brakes do start to fade in stop and go situations. I can noticeably feel the pedal travel get further. Kia should have gave it a little bigger brakes from the factory.  The other gripe I have it the seat material. Ours has cloth seats and the material just isn't great. I do not believe it will hold up great over the next 5 or so years. Time will tell.                 Other than those gripes which are minor to me the Sorento is a great SUV. I tow a trailer which weighs about 2500 pounds and it takes it just fine. It is comfortable and easy to drive for extended periods.  The third row is usable. The highlander and pilot had more third row room but the Sorento's third row is fine and usable for children or small adults. I'm 5'8'' and I can sit back there fine. Anything over 5'10'' or so is going to run out of head room.  With the third row up there is very little room for storage.      Overall I am very happy and my wife and I love it. Very glad we chose the Sorento.","212":null,"213":"This car is excellent in value and price","214":"Now i previously owned a KIA Sorento 2010 i bought this new one BIG IMPROVEMENTS !! ROOMIER !! comfortable !! most of all reliable !!","215":"Major engine issues at 60,000 miles.  Kia will not honor warranty.  Warning. Do not buy from Kia","216":"Coming off of a Lexus RX, I was concerned that it wouldn't feel as luxurious. Although it's stiffer and less \"designed\", I fell in love with the Sorento immediately upon driving it off the lot. It's tough but not trucky, comfortable but not couch-like, and big but not cumbersome. It has great pick up and drives like a car, and I happen to think it looks pretty darn cute on the road. Having said this, the reason I'm writing this review is that I was in my first car accident in my 38 years just this week. I was T-boned, and before I knew what had happened I realized the car was flipping. SUV's by nature may be more likely to roll, and that may be a deterant to some, but in this instance I think it was a blessing. I believe the roll helped lessen the force of the hit, which struck my child's door. As I understand it, T-Bones can be very catastrophic, especially to the person in the receiving seat. Between the airbags, restraints, and general contour of the car, when the car came to rest we were completely unscathed. Completely. The moment I can, I will go get another Sorento and will feel safer than ever. And thank you to the designers of this car for helping me walk away with my son!","217":"I have owned 65 + vehicles- luxury to economy cars, high performance cars, SUV's, and Minivans. The Sorento has gotten more things just right than any vehicle I have ever owned. The push button start works perfectly, headlights give you the right options, controls layout is excellent, the ride\/handling balance is very good and the engine and transmission perform flawlessly in sync. The engineering to get the amount of space and passenger capacity in a vehicle only 187 in. in length is a real accomplishment. Most other competition is 7 to 10 in. greater in vehicle length. With this space efficiency, comes weight savings and the strong V6, so it has good performance for a vehicle in this class. We got 24.7 mpg on highway trip.  At this point of 2,500 miles, we could not be happier with our decision.","218":"The only reason I am getting another car is , it is to fancy and too much technology for me. Not a thing wrong with it.","219":"I purchased this car because of the value and the bells and whistles the car has to offer.  Everywhere I go:  work, pleasure, people stop and admire my vehicle.\nI live in the Tahoe (California) area, where we had an epic snow season last winter.  The vehicle was just gliding thru the snow covered roads, no sliding, no worries. I do highly recommend the vehicle.","220":"We bought this beautiful, expensive car specifically for the added safety features. From the start, we have had ongoing problems with the blind spot detection system. It randomly fails. This happens under all types of road and weather conditions, without warning. The system sometimes spontaneously resets itself, and sometimes it does not. Our smart key entry also failed once. We could not enter the vehicle with either of our smart keys...we had to pull out the manual key to get into the car. On another occasion, the entire sound system failed! This lasted until we turned the car off and restarted it. Needless to say, our vehicle has been in and out of the dealership service area many times...with absolutely no resolution to the problem. This is the most beautiful, most expensive, and most unreliable car that we have ever owned. KIA should replace the car with a reliable one!","221":"The Kia Sorento EX 6\/AWD is a fantastic auto.  I had had my mind set on a GMC Terrain, but there is no comparison, not even close.  Our Kia is so quiet yet so powerful.  There are no more bumps in the road, and it handles almost as well as my Honda Accord did.  It came with third row seating, heated leather seats, the back-up camera, lane warning, and power liftgate, all of which i strongly recommend, oh, and all those electronic thingies.  With the flat folding rear seats the cargo space is huge, and they are easy to operate.  It has a power passenger seat and even the second row reclines (separately left and right).  Our ride from NJ to Maine was actually enjoyable, plus we got 25 mpg at 80 mph!  We put $5000 down and are leasing at only $300\/month for 36 months.  With 5000 lb towing capacity it will be a breeze towing our boat up to Maine in July.  We are thrilled with our decision.  Gotta deal with Tom Brennan at Sansone Jrs. in Neptune, NJ.","222":"I should probably wait to write a review as I've only had the car for a couple of weeks and haven't driven it that much (I think it still has less than 500 miles on it).  Regardless, I'm delighted with the car as it handles and performs far better than I expected it would.  There are places where the fit isn't what a top-tier car should be but, then, it's not a top-tier car.  However, from someone who has owned 8 Mercedes-Benz, this car performs right up there.  Some of the things I especially like:\n1.  The Hyundai Lambda engine is an excellent match for the car.  It's very responsive and the relatively high butt gears gets you off the line with a nice snap.  No, this isn't a muscle car V8 but for a small SUV, it's damned decent.  I don't complain about the fuel economy though my children might disown me for not buying a hybrid.\n2.  Exceptional braking with virtually no loss of control - even in hard braking maneuvers.  Granted, I'm not too aggressive with the brakes right now as I'm letting them 'break' in gently but the car still stops in a very short amount of distance.\n3.  The navigation\/entertainment center is very easy to use - it all makes sense.  I've owned cars where I was continually searching through the manual to figure out, \"How do I make it do . . . \" whereas on the Kia, it's easy to find the features I'm looking for.  Even the more esoteric features that aren't used much, they're easy to find.  The sound system is excellent.\n4.  I absolutely love the self-leveling, HID headlights.  Since I'm an old man, my night vision isn't what I'd like it to be.  With these headlights, I can see everything in front of me clearly.  Good news for you who drive near me at night!\n5.  Consumer Reports rates the car as having an excellent frequency of repair record.  I'm hoping they're right.\n6.  I like the looks of the car.  Subjective, I know, but it's better than driving a car that I think is ugly.\n7.  My brother-in-law, who likes to point out everything what's wrong with everything I do, said that KIA stands for 'Killed in Action'.  Actually, Ki is Chinese for energy (sometimes transliterated as 'Qi').  They added the 'a' to stand for 'Asia', despite the fact that the car is built in the USA.  Now that I own one, I see them all over the place.\n\nThere are three things that I don't like about the car:\n1.  No Day Time Running Lights.  I could turn the headlights on during the day but that leads me to Dislike Number 2.\n2.  There's no warning chime, buzzer, etc if you leave your headlights on, shut off the engine and open the door the door.  I think that's been a feature on virtually every car made in the last 40 years!  Granted, the electrical system will shut down everything if the voltage gets too low - nice feature - but that's hard on batteries if you like to have the car lit up during the day and aren't warned that you're leaving your headlights on.\n3.  Our trim line uses a hard, black plastic for parts of the steering wheel, the window control trim and the center console.  How much could have it cost to do those pieces out of a nice wood?","223":"Compared to numerous other makes. Got the best band for the buck with the KIA.","224":"Great value for the money.  \n\nAttractive interior, very roomy and handles well.  I love the 3rd row seating that folds flat.","225":"Great car the handling is very responsive when turning and it's very good when you have the blind spot detector.","226":"looked at several others including the Honda crv and the Subaru forrester and couldn't believe the additional size and value in this car. I have 2000 miles on it since it was leased and I love it. the interior materials are not cheap but very soft and rich looking. the controls while incorporating touch technology still have a lot of buttons and dials which I personally love. great sounding satellite radio and the noise level from outside is minimal. I have the 240 horse turbo and was concerned with the low milage epa estimates for the car thinking I would be lucky to get 22-23 miles per gallon. I changed the selection for the engine to echo mode when I drove it home and it has been there ever since. I have the awd and I have consistently averaged 25 + miles since new. I have not had any lack of power in this mode and will continue to leave it there. back seats very roomy and had three adults back there going out to eat the other night with no issues. back storage area very large also. another nice feature which I haven't had to use yet is the locking hub mode for deep snow etc. great car at a wonderful price.","227":"Never would have thought I would have chosen a Kia, but after weeks of comparing, test driving all the options out there and comparing some more Kia was the clear choice. Not a small 4 cylinder econo box and not as big as a the full size 7 passenger SUVs, just right for usually 5 passengers with option to flip up to get 7 seats. Ride is quiet and comfortable. Visibility is good. Technology works well with clear displays and easily understood controls. The only minus is the steering. It is way too loose. We have to always select the sport option or the Kia wanders on the road. Overall a great buy.","228":"Good performance and value.  Excellent functionality and quality.  So glad we have it.  Great buy.","229":"Updated after 10 months -  Bottom line - The Sorento is still a quality ride.  My biggest knock is the UVO electronics has had to be reset several times after locking up and the KIA service department we've dealt with SUCKS!  At 5K we took this vehicle in for a front passenger door rattle and were lectured by the service manager about how if they find a penny or something similar in the door we'd be charged $105 per hour for repairs.  In fact if they found nothing we'd be charged for their troubleshooting time.  After dealing with GREAT hassle free Honda service it blew my mind how the KIA service manager treated us!  Just can't beat Honda service, pretty sure we'll go back to a Pilot or maybe scale down to a CRV in 2018. \nORIGINAL REVIEW - This Kia is a really nice mid-size SUV!  I'm a Honda guy, my daily commuter is still an Accord.  My wife is the primary driver of the Sorento and it replaced our 08 Pilot.  We really research major purchases like this to death and tried out most of the SUV's in this class, minus the luxury brands.  It took us 2 months to make a decision and it came down the Sorento and the Pilot.  I honestly don't think we'd have went wrong either way but after 3 months of ownership we're still happy with the Sorento.  We love our LX but our only regret is going cheap with the LX.  In hine sight the larger touchscreen, some of the active safety features and the fog lights would've been well worth the extra cost.  We'll probably drive this Sorento for 2 or 3 years and upgrade, probably only looking at the Pilot and Sorento at that time.  Things I like about the Sorento:  Power, the V6 is a beast.  Comfort, very comfortable passenger compartment.  Front and middle row are every bit as good as the Pilot, third row comfort goes to the Pilot but we don't use the third row much.  Fuel economy is pretty good we're right around 24 mpg overall.  Quiet, comfortable ride.  The warrenty is huge, it was the deciding factor in our decision.  The only knocks:  Small infotainment screen, this is my fault for going cheap.  Lack of storage when using the third row.  Overall we're very happy with this Sorento!","230":"This is my second Sorento. I traded in a 2014 and there is a world of difference. This vehicle is quiet and smooth as a babie's behind. We have the 3rd row (for emergencies) but the seats are folded down. The back is huge. Maybe not as big as the Pilot, but neither is the car itself. All I can tell you is to go take one for a drive. They range in price from $25k - $45k. Mine is the LX V6 AWD with convenience package and 3rd row seat. MSRP was $33k. They have several incentives like active military, veteran, student and combinations. Your mileage may differ.","231":null,"232":"If considering the premium package, definitely consider the touring package. \n\nYou get a much better screen (Nav\/multimedia) and the glass roof (panoramic sunroof) is unbelievable. In our case the cost difference was only $44 \/ month payment wise. So, we got the touring and have not regretted the purchase.","233":"We drove Chevy's, Ford's, Honda's & Toyota's and liked the Kia Sorento the best.  The car is rated higher than the rest in safety & reliability and has a far better warranty as well.  The comfort and passenger room in the front seat is far better than the other brands.  My wife did all of the homework, drove and rode in all of the other brands and Kia got the sale.  If you don't believe it, go drive one and see.  Now we have 6,000 miles on the Kia 11\/3\/16 and all is well, my wife still loves it.  Have had it a year now and there are things I don't like.  I don't like the console opening from the front instead of from the drivers side.  If you try and get anything out of it while driving, it's difficult.  I really don't like all of the electronics they put in cars these days.  I am really tired of having to break out the manual to find out how to change the clock or do most anything.","234":"You would have to pay $1000s more to get same features in an Acura, Audi, Lexus, Infiniti, BMW or Mercedes.","235":"Traded in a 2013 Sorento for the redesigned 2016 EX V-6. Outstanding vehicle. Quite, plenty of power, excellent handling. I will definitely keep this one. Also have a 2011 Kia Optima EX fully loaded and love it. Traded in a Hyundai XG 350L in for it. Have 79,000 miles on it now with no problems. I will continue to buy Kia's.\n\nUPDATE: Had the vehicle now for 10 months, 14800 miles. Still completely satisfied. Get around 26 city\/30 highway. No complaints. Would definitely buy another. Extra alarms like the back up warning and cars in your blind spots are very nice features.","236":null,"237":"I disagree with the Reviewer's Cons:  That the\"  2.0 Turbo lacks punch from a standstill \".  I have to feather the gas pedal at a stop light to avoid spinning the wheels!  This engine has plenty of punch at any speed, I promise you-especially after the engine is broken in.  I have about 13,000 miles now.  Coast to coast from sea level to 9,000 feet in the mountains.  The great thing about the Turbo is you don't loose power at higher elevations.  The EX is so quiet and comfortable I can drive 800 miles and still go dancing!  To date I have had zero problems with this car.  I ditched my 2014 Honda CRV for this car as too noisy, slow, bad handling\n and uncomfortable for road trips.","238":null,"239":"Hands down, the most comfortable, quiet, refined ride of any car I have ever driven. The styling is great, the car just sounds solid when closing the doors, and the thought Kia put into the design shows throughout. We went with the top model and the extras that brings makes long trips really enjoyable.  I have driven Sorentos as rental cars over the past 7-8 years but vowed I'd never own one due the the fairly harsh ride. But the 2016 is a true game changer!! It's the first time my wife has ever said \"I love this car\"!  Me too!","240":"Loving my new Sorento and still have money left in my pocket! Looks great and drives great. This new remodel turns heads. Everyone on my block and at my kid's school has been asking about it. Sharp looking interior, well thought out with lots of cargo space plus additional storage bins underneath. Rear back-up camera, bluetooth, UVO services (voice command), heated seats, AWD, parking sensor, USB ports everywhere, power adjustable driver's seat and many other bells and whistles. Compared to Explorers, Highlanders and Pilots, you get so much more bang for your buck plus a far better bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranty. I now jump at the opportunity to run out and get something, anything, just to get me in my new 2016 Sorento!!","241":"I have never purchase a new vehicle so quickly.  I have been driving a 2010 SRX Cadillac Premium Collection for five years.  Who would have ever thought I would buy a KIA SUV?!  I went to the dealership to drive the Volvo (which I literally hated) but I had done some internet research on the 2016 Sorento so when the salesman said you really need to drive the Sorento, I said ok.  That's all it took, I fell in love with this automobile.  The quality of the interior with it's Napa Leather and the ease of the instrument panel and the large viewing screen and the beauty of the drive won me over at once.  Now all I had to do was decide just what I wanted and the trim package, the color Titanium was a given.  Well I wanted it all ....a SX Limited.  The dealership had to locate one in Missouri.  It was exactly what I wanted color trim etc., and lo and behold when it arrived it had several other perks, like a tow package, gorgeous side steps, remote start, cross bars and several niceties.  People said you are going from a Cadillac to a Kia and my reply is hell yes.....it truly is a much better car, much more comfortable, the seats are the most comfortable I have ever had and the black and white interior is stunning.....people can't get over the look and quality.  The visibility out the front windshield is vast with very minimal blind spots.  There are so many bells and whistles on this car I couldn't begin to comment on all.  Let's just say, it's right up there with the Lincoln MKX (much cheaper), BMW, and other luxery vehicles.  I read this was Kia's goal to put forth an SUV that would possibly attract these luxury car drivers to the new Sorento and yes that's exactly what is happening.  I have been driving mine for two weeks and I'm still so much in love with it's gorgeous body stye and all it's safety and wonderful amenities along with the quite, high quality interior.  The ease of the voice activated navigation and the very simple bluetooth hands free telephone along with the Xeon lighting, the full panoramic sun roof, the roomy storage, the thrill of having an actual spare tire (Cadillac had a pump), the very peppy takeoff and getaway, the quietness of the ride on highway and the nifty red and blue lights on the interior at night make this very quick purchase of the 2016 Sorento one of the happiest and best decisions I've ever made.","242":"Had my LX V6 over a year now.  Great ride. Nice finishings. Gas mileage almost always EXCEEDS the 18\/26 posted.  On highway, I usually get about 30 mpg- wirh a V6 engine!  Car insurance is starting to go down but it can be pricier than other SUV in its class. Something to keep in mind.\n\nDriver seat is nicely shaped but slightly firm.  The wing-up edges can pose a challenge for those with mobility issues requiring help getting into the 2 front seats.  \n\nPlenty of leg room in the front and back.    I enjoy driving it a lot but I have a list of a few things KIA could do to really spruce things up:\n\n1.  Please add adjustable brakes.  Brakes are a little mushy if you're a light-footed breaker.   \n\n2.  Please, please PLEASE add the option to silence that annoying alarm that rings when it's 40F outside.  It's annoying and startling at times!!\n\n3.  It's hard to wash the top of the back window with that fin in the way- esp with the squeegee.  Can that fin be reshaped or removed?\n\n4.  It's annoying that you can't change the radio station when the backup camera is on.  Really?!  Also, with the wheel radio control, you can only change the radio position one station at a time.  Would be nice to be able to hit the button 4 times and actually go up or down 4 presets.\n\n5.  Please, please, PLEASE, KIA add the Global Open-Windows feature to the remote.  It would be a god send for people like me with heat intolerance.  PLEASE!!!\n\n6.  Daytime running lights on L, LX models, please!\n\n7.  Would appreciate a rubber cargo mat for 7-passenger cargo area when seats are folded down rather than the less-than-helpful carpeted cargo mat available.\n\n8.  Automatic up and down driver window feature is nice but it takes a lot of finessing to adjust the auto-down if you need interrupt it.\n\n9.  UVO system is OK on LX- nothing spectacular.  KIA- please make the 7\"\/8\" navigation system standard.\n\nThe Sorento is a good value and a nice drive, despite my little nit picks.  But I think it's the little things that separate good cars from the great ones.  Sorento is not a disappointment but a good car that has the potential to be a really great one with a little attention to details that make the driving experience even more of a pleasure.","243":"I started looking for cross over SUVs with the AWD, and a third row. I used to drive a 1996 Honda Accord LX (Manual transmission) I really wanted a Hyundai Vera Cruz but they stopped making the vehicle in 2012. Then I thought about the Mazda 5 (manual transmission) but it looked like mini-van car.  I ended up focusing on the Santa Fe and Mazda CX9. I got a consumer report magazine and added the Outlander and Sorento to my research radar. In concert with a good friend I test drove all vehicles 3 months before I purchased. My friend road in the back while I test drove and used a check sheet to document wind noise and backseat comfort ability etc. By the end of the day I narrowed it down to the Mazda and the KIA.  I purchased a 2016 LX Sorento with 3 miles on the odometer.  The ride is smooth, I feel like I am riding in luxury without paying the price.  The vehicle is not too big and able to do all the things I need it to do.  Cargo room is great; however not when the third row is in use.  I only have two issues the Bluetooth tends to spike in volume when a call comes in and that can be startling EVERY time and I never feel completely confident when parallel parking.  I feel as if visibility is limited.  I am overly satisfied with my purchase and the price.  I may consider upgrading to EX in a few years.\n******Update*****\nIts been nearly two years and I am still very pleased with my vehicle.  I have a little over 10k on the odometer and it is in tip top shape.   I have no complaints and highly recommend this vehicle to those who are looking for more bang for their buck.  I am exponentially pleased.","244":"I bought the best KIA available and I have not been disappointed.  I drove nearly every similarly sized SUV in existence and nothing compares in terms of value.  I definitely recommend the V-6 version, its much more fun to drive and, I believe, much safer.  As an added bonus, I was treated like a human being at the dealership and it was a pleasurable experience compared to some to which I have been exposed.  If there is a downside ...it will probably take quite a while to master all of the technology in this car.","245":"After a lot of shopping for SUV's with a 3rd row, I made the decision to purchase the Kia Sorento.  The car looks and rides like a $50,000 SUV, but at a fraction of the price.  I am typically drawn to European cars, but feel this car offers all the luxuries I am accustomed to with the backing of a 100,000 mile warranty. One additional selling point for me was the large amount of usable cargo space.  Many of the newer SUV's have a significant sloping to the back window, which is not practical for 3rd row occupants or dogs.  The Kia Sorento gives my 3 furry friends significant head room in the back. There is also an air conditioning vent in the 3rd row so my pups can stay cool.  My kids love the car too.  They have always been spoiled with their rides and this car is no different. We are very happy with the fit and finish of the car.","246":"We\u2019ve had the Sorento 14 months, and our impressions are some good and some not as good.  We have not had to take the car back to the dealer for a single problem--which is probably the single most important good thing about the vehicle.  It is a well built vehicle.\nFirst the good things:\n1. Love the body design and overall exterior and interior look of the vehicle.\n2. The ride is very smooth and quiet, with ample power for passing and hopping onto the freeway.\n3. Gas mileage is above what they rated it to be.  We\u2019re getting over 25 mpg on highway and 21-22 in the city.\n    and that's in the 7 passenger, 6 cylinder, 3.3 liter SX \n4. It has a very short turning-radius for that long a vehicle.\n5. There\u2019s ample leg-room in all 3 rows of seats, but the headroom (with a sunroof) is a little too low in the 3rd row of seats.\n6.  I like the manual shifting capability.  It makes driving on winding mountain roads a lot easier on the brake pads.\n7.  The blind-spot warning and reverse warning systems work well to assist in driving.  The visibility when backing up is not as good as we'd like, so the backup camera and warning system help in that regard.\n8.  I like that the leg room along the \"hump\" (console area) next to your right leg is much better than in many of the other vehicles we test-drove--like the Nissan Murano and Infiniti  QX30.\n\n       Some of the not so good features are:\n1.  Entering and exiting the 3rd row seats is a slightly difficult.\n2.  The front seats are a little too firm, and the power lumbar is slightly noticeable even when fully contracted.\n3. The steering wheel position could be allowed to go lower and farther out.\n4.  I liked the CVT transmission on our traded in Murano, so I do miss that smooth, quiet shifting.","247":"I have test driven 4 different Kia Sorentos and I recommend skipping any of the 4 cylinder models.  I went over to the Nissan dealer after trying those models and almost didn't return.  The 6 cylinder is pure driving joy.\n\nThey have a $32,000 model with the 6 cylinder, leather, satellite radio.. And no sun roof..  For me this model  would have been perfect except the radio really sounds lousy and it's virtually impossible to upgrade.  This is a $10,000 savings over other  similarly equipped three row SUVs on the market. \n\nSince I really care about my music I would've had to upgrade to the $38,000 model  which adds a panoramic sunroof gorgeous rims and larger tires plus an infinity sound system.\n\nThe drive is very nimble and sporty while-being smooth enough for those of us who like a little tactile communication with the road.\n\nOther three row SUVs on the market feel much more cumbersome, heavy And over bloated by comparison:  while the 2016 Kia Sorrento feels lean, agile, youthful and fun to drive.\n\nIt feels like a precision machine:  very well put together.","248":"Recently purchased a 2016 Kia Sorento SX after thorough review on this site and several others. Opted for the SX trim since we really wanted the UVO navigation package and other features that came standard at that trim package. Very impressed with the acceleration of the V-6 3.3L engine, smooth handling, and solid suspension.  I think that there is incredible value in this vehicle and that it compares favorably with luxury SUVs that command prices 10-20K higher. \n\nOf the very few criticisms that I've read regarding the 2016 Kia Sorento, one was the limited available interior space with the 3rd row. I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a mid-sized SUV that is not intended to constantly haul 7 people around but rather provides you the option of extra seating when you're in a jam.  \n\nWent for a test-drive at Cowboy Kia of Conroe and was very impressed. I was able to negotiate a great deal and am a highly satisfied customer and new Kia owner.","249":"If I told you about the past three cars I had before my Sorento, you wouldn't believe my bad luck. I still walk out of the store and thank god \"Black Betty\" is there to greet me. We bought this car less than two weeks before moving across country. We went with two rows. Just my husband and myself, and a bunch of fur babies. We looked at every car out there. New\/used. We stayed away from anything 45k and above. We had about 10k-12k to put down. Our options were open. Initially my husband test drove the Sorento. While I was impressed\/size with the appearance I was favoring the sleek and sexy body\/look of the Nissan Altima. Obviously the two cars aren't a like at all. We did need space. I went over the Pros and cons. I'll share them with you now. \nPro: Space, the large trunk offers much more space than most SUV's without removing seats. \nThe body is sexy, it looks nice. People are always caught off guard by the brand.\nThe interior is really detailed. I love the two tone. Black and tan with tan seats and black carpets. \nEven the 4cl has some kick when you want it to move.\nIt rides so smooth. Not as great as my Lincoln, but come on it was a Lincoln!\nInterface has many options to choose from\nMode for gas: eco, sport, regular\nEase of getting in and out. My grandmother loved how you could just slip in and out. \nMany options for power, you can all have your devices plugged in at once. \nThe seats are comfortable, you don't feel stiff and unable to move freely. \nThe backup camera, something I never thought I would use, is very useful.\nLeg room for passengers is always a pro. The movement of the second row allows people in the backseat to relax and not feel stuck.\nGas is pretty good. We drove over 4000 miles from South Carolina to Washington State, making stops in both Arkansas, and Illinois. That's not an easy drive in any car. With 6 animals. I wouldn't have chosen any other vehicle to have done it in. we got 27.8 miles per gallon. I'll take it. \n---\nCons\nThe wind with knock you over, no really if it's windy let off the gas. \nI feel like for a brand new car the headlights lack in visualizations. \nThe speed on the windshield wipers is not up to par, in fact I consider them almost dangerously slow. \nThe sound system could be better. I will have to have it replaced with a better system at some point. It's lacking in every way.\n(The Sounds system for years it seems on Kia models has come with issues, you have to reset it with a pin (pointed object, being inserted into a tiny hole) Or there will be no sound, from ipod's cd's ect..\nFront grill isn't east to clean. Took many car washes to get the bugs off of the grill. I spent almost $30.00 just trying to removed them. There is still residue. \nIf you have pets HUGE annoyance \"You can't leave your keys in the car and lock the door, thus leaving the air on.\" If your keys are in the car your doors will not lock. \nAuto lock doors. Great for when you run in a store and forgot to lock your doors, not great for when you run back into the house to grab your purse. \nMostly the cons are dumb things that are more annoyances that come with learning more about your car. The first three are my only real gripes.\n\nOver all. I think we went with the best choice. The price was worth it. Not over priced, not over sized. I like the kia community. We have had a really great experience with out service provider. Our car is nice enough to feel luxurious, but not well known enough to be targeted. As silly as that sounds. When you're from Chicago you learn the little things are important. It's great that it can fit into small spaces, tow a camper, lug 25 2x4's. Or just move a family across the continental United States. It handles nicely, it rides better and smoother than most SUV's I've ever been in. Mostly I feel safe when I take her out everyday. Nothing feels better then knowing not only am I in a car with great crash test ratings, but if she breaks down Kia has my back. Take a chance, invest in a Kia.","250":"The new Sorrento has a more grown up feel....bigger and more of a presence.....like the Borrego of 2009.   That SUV is now one of the most sought after used SUVs in the market.  I love my Borrego and wish Kia would have continued the large SUV format.  At least this version of the Sorento is larger and has a substantial road presence.   I was torn between the new Pilot and this version but the warranty and past Kia performance convinced me to continue my Kia loyalty.  I hope the Teleride is released soon.....it looks like the awesome full SUV that Kia needs.","251":"Edited After owning this for 4 months: I should not have bought this vehicle , Feeling very bad for throwing money down the drain. \nThe Vehicle Suspension is very bad. Took to Dealer they said everything is fine as per specs. \nI noticed that the Vehicle is deteriorating very fastly. In Just 4 months - It shakes as if roller coaster and no suspension is there and too much vibration. Gear shifting is not smooth. Ride comfort is not there , Cornering is not good. and engine has become noisy. Also noticed Wind noise is not acceptable - it is getting worse now at 50 miles Wind noise is too much.\n\nI am already hating my vehicle within 4 months.\n----------------------------\n\nI own my 2016 sorento Lx for just one month now. Though I was very happy initially now I feel there are areas of improvement like air and road noise at higher speeds like 70 mph. And vehicle suspension is smooth but left-right bumpiness is too much that is annoying and continues for a long duration - I always owned sedan and this is first SUV so not sure if this is normal. \nRide is smooth.\n3 Mirrors and rear view camera All have different zoom ratio which is very confusing and needs real improvement.\n\nOverall I am happy.\nI always owned Brand value cars like Honda. Trusting Kia as they have shown serious improvement. Hope they don't fail me on my first Kia. The warranty of 10 years 100k is what made me trust Kia.","252":"This car is hands down the nicest car in its class. It handles like a dream with superior suspension and clean, tight handling. Seven seats and way too many features to list here. This is a rock solid, high performing SUV. You won't be disappointed. All wheel drive. Awesome. Test drive one for yourself.","253":"This car is just what we needed for our family of 4. We had a minivan and was looking for a reliable car that we could take on long trips that would hold our luggage\nand be priced for a family budget...The car is roomy  and has plenty of cargo space. It looks great and rides comfortably. It is not too big or small just right in size.","254":"Go test drive and look at the SXL-I have the 2 row one, I didn't need 3 rows. I got the 2016 almost as soon as it came out after poring over many crossover reviews, test drives etc. I wanted as much in terms of features and comfort as I could get for a decent price.This was by far the best deal for the money I could find. VERY comfortable, great features- LOVE the heated steering wheel.Extremely sharp styling both inside and out.Mine is black on black and even in deep south, was very comfortable last summer in very hot weather. Only thing I didn't get was the very top technology package with the front camera-I do have the rear camera, lane change warning,cross traffic rear warning, navigation, blue tooth, satellite radio, huge sunroof etc. Many usb ports- first 2 oil changes\/services very affordable.After suffering through Mercedes Benz after warranty services I will never get one of those German so called luxury vehicles again. A BMW or MB crossover suv with these features would've run about 30-40 thousand more and it truly looks just as good side by side and is wonderful to drive.","255":"I have had a 2010 Hyundai Veracruz replaced with a 2013 Santa Fe Sport Turbo.  Price drove me to Kia for the value.  I loved the Turbo in the Santa Fe and was worried about a non turbo 4 cyl Kia Sorento.   However price of a lease was the major factor.  I was ready to accept less as the Santa Fe Turbo had some very nice features.   To my surprise the 2016 Sorento has impressed me more than I could imagine.   First is it solid, totally.  Closing the doors it has the feeling of a tank. The ride is the best of all the Hyundai's by far.   The loose suspension of the Veracruz is gone and the somewhat hobby horse feeling of the Santa Fe Sport is gone.  I assume the longer wheel base is the reason.  It rides solid and smooth, the steering is tight and responsive.  Yes the 2.4 litre engine is not the Hyundai Turbo but it has what it needs to do the job.   The car is the LX model with the convenience package.  A great car at a very reasonable price  and we get more cargo space and leg room then the Hyundai.  I could not be more happy.   5000 miles later all is well. No Problems at all. Went to the dealer for a Oil Change and Tire Rotation and they performed 2 computer programming upgrades and a tail gate latch fix what was a problem on some but not mine.  I have finally have a complaint.  The AM radio section of the Radio is terrible.  I mean really horrible.","256":"My wife and I were looking for a practical road car for our extended weekend getaways, with lots of room and creature comforts. This car definitely meets all of our expectations, but also works well on my daily commutes to the office. The quality and workmanship are outstanding, and the ride is solid and capable.  Great car. UPDATE AT 20,000 miles- Very happy with this car, no problems or concerns to date.  Lots of compliments on the ride from passengers.  Great Value!","257":"Purchased in Dec 2015. Road trip from S\/Diego to S\/Francisco. Two thumbs up.  Quiet smooth and comfortable. Avg 28mpg.  Have the LX , ,V 6. With 290 hp, it can get up and go. Raced a Porche Cayenne for 3 miles but for smart and backed off. I COULD HAVE DUSTED HIM, but my darling wife got nervous.","258":"Awesome car and great dealer experience at Keffer Kia in Mooresville, NC","259":"I just bought a loaded 2016 KIA Sorento SXL with the Technology Package and the 3.3 peppy V6 . Having owned a Lexus RX before,  luxury SUV and KIA was simply not on my radar until I inadvertently came across an online article about this Sorento that piqued my interest. So after 18 hours of online research and watching YouTube video reviews, I was amazed to read the many glowing written reviews and hear the positive video reviews of this newly designed seven seat Sorento. A trip to the KIA dealer ensued and I am so glad to have went. This 2016 KIA Sorento SXL blew me away when I saw it up close and drove it. Rick Jacobs at Fucillo KIA knew this SUV  inside and out, he answered every question I threw at him.  With the Sorento's luxurious curb appeal, the way it handled, its numerous safety features, its voice activated navigation, long warranty and beautiful two tone ivory and black Nappa leather interior, I was hooked.\n\nAfter 6 months of driving my Kia Sorento, I am completely satisfied! It is everything I had hoped and expected this SUV to be. There have been no issues at all!!! Incredibly quiet cabin and comfortable Nappa leather makes driving this Sorento a pleasure.  Would definitely encourage others to buy this vehicle!!!\n\nMy KIA Sorento is now a year old and still the BEST SUV I have ever purchased. Have had no problems whatsoever!","260":"After months of searching for a crossover\/ midsize SUV, I've finally found it with the Kia Sorento!! I've looked at Hyundai Sante Fe Sport, Nissan Murano, Nissan Rogue, Ford Edge and the Lexus RX350. I was on the fence with all of them until I decided to check out the KiA Sorento.  I fell immediately in love with the Sorento. The interior is luxurious with a lot of well appointed materials. I got the SXL AWD 2.0LT with the  merlot nappa leather interior with glossy black exterior. It's a sexy looking SUV !!  Plus that panoramic moonroof...OMG...amazing!!! The drive is smooth, the seats are very very comfy with 14 way adjustable seating along with 4 way adjustable headrest.  This is a very reasonably priced car with all the bells and whistles. I wish Sorento had a lever to automatically fold up and down the second row seats though but that's ok. My only regret is that I didn't get the technology package (adaptable cruise control, surround view and a few others...) . Nevertheless, I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually look forward to driving to and from work now :-)","261":"I never in a million years thought I would buy a Kia. The car is so roomy for my giant husband. The seats are comfortable for my delicate back. The ride is smooth-I must watch my speed as I find I do 80 because it is so quiet and my speed creeps up on me. I  thought I was going to get a Subaru Outback. They were giving me a poor trade in on my Cadillac and not offering a deal in any way and I was not in love with the car. I actually am not a lover of cars as many people are but, I love my Sorento. As far as trade in value, who knows and who cares. We tend to just keep them until they die anyway. I am still getting used to the bells and whistles.","262":"No storage with third seat. Everything else great.","263":"Traded a 2013 Sorento 4 cylinder in for the 2016 Sorento V6 Ex premium pkg. Absolutely love the redesign. Extremely quiet, plenty of power, very comfortable. Also own a 2011 Optima EX with the prem\/tech pkg and absolutely love it. No problems or complaints with either vehicle. Actually loved the 2013 Sorento but needed the V6 for towing. Plan to continue buying Kia's.","264":"I must say, i own this car for over 2 years  now and I have no complaints about it. I have a little over 22000 miles and no problems at all with the car. My wife and I like to take weekend trips all the time and we are always pleased with the smooth drive and the comfort. Can't wait till next year to get a new one!!!\nIf you think to get one don't hesitate go for it. Is definitely worth the money!!!!","265":"WOW ! Never expected so much usable power from the base L 2.4  4 cylinder. First new car in 15 years and I shopped them all hard. Rav 4 boring , small and oil burning issues. Honda CRV  CVT transmission farce, vibration problems. Escape too small. CX-5 smaller and no reclining seats, cheap feel and vibrating engine. Rogue CVT junk. Equinox rough feel poor cornering.\nThe Sorento  blew these all away in my test drives and feels even better after 1000 miles.  22 MPG in city driving, excellent cornering when pushed hard and pretty smooth ride. Very quiet on highway . The other car makers are losing so many sales due to Kia product  and their own mistakes (see above comments and google it ) .Japanese coasting on reputation and counting on buyers whose parents had a great Honda or Toyota. I feel even better with my decision and would have had serious regret with several of the other choices available in this class. The kids love the far reclining rear seats and a LARGE dog kennel fits in the back (5 seat model).  Interior quality, feel , comfort and intuitive controls and beautiful dash.  I like the L base because of price and I don't need to add weight or complexity. The 6 speed transmission shifts nice and you can manual shift ( without it up or downshifting on its own except at stop it goes in to first gear) Lots of torque and power from down low 2000-4000 is sweet and engine is never strained .","266":"I bought my 2016 Kia Sorento on Oct 31 ,2015 shiny Red Apple exterior and beige interior , wood trim on doors and shift knob,,it looked like a very expensive import Suv,,,heated front seats ,etc...well the tires pressure was 45psi  and I was surprised because on the side wall of the tire says 44psi max but the mpg was 32 for the first few days, ride was very bumpy and I could feel every single imperfection of the road, so I decided to lower the tires pressure to 40 psi ,, ride improved a lot much smoother and quiet but mpg went down  from 32 to 25\/26  and that caught my attention very much,,I kept that psi for 2 weeks and mileage was very low,,so I went back to 45 and \" Wow\"  my mpg went up again !!! Now I keep 42psi on the 4 tires and mpg average 26\/27 , still good because 39 dlls gets me a full tank of gas for 1 1\/2 week of driving..my only concern now is a very weird jolt on the transmission when I come to an stop, it launches forward lightly when I am waiting at the stop light and when slowing down to stop the shifting is lil bit abrupt,  not smooth as it should be in a brand new car,,,engine is dormant in Eco mode ,,but very alive fast and powerful in sport mode, but every time the engine is turned off  driving mode goes blank meaning you have to set Eco or sport mode again and again....overall I am happy with my Sorento I will take it to a Kia dealership to have the tranny and engine checked, but the Sorento looks are great ,comfort is superior if tires are kept at low psi,,noise is lil bit high at 60+ mph and you have plenty of room for long legs ,tall people and  lots of hide away places under the rear back seat if you carry expensive items...and I am a happy owner of this gorgeous Suv..Sorento LX 2016","267":"This is a very nice car. An exceptional value. I bought the base model, it's all I could afford. For under $28,000 I think it's a steal. I like the size, the ease of handling, the smooth ride, and pretty much everything about the car. The Sorento I bought is the base 2.4 liter 4. This engine is all you need unless you are planning to race it. If I could have afforded the higher payments I may have bought the V 6. This 2016 Sorento with the 2.4 engine will run circles around my 2014 Honda CR-V. And they both have a 2.4 liter 185 horse power engine. They both have a six speed automatic tranny. they both cost the same. The biggest difference to me is the highway. The Sorento accelerates effortlessly on the interstate. The Honda is much slower. The materials in the two cars are day and night difference. The CR-V, also a base model has base model interior. The Sorento has far nicer seat upholstery, the dash, doors, carpet and so on are much more attractive, and in fact to me do not look like base model interior. The Sorento rides smoother and over all is ore comfortable. To the Honda's credit I have had a few close calls with it, and the braking and emergency maneuvering to avoid hitting deer were very good. Over all for every day driving, trip, touring, and so on I would chose the Sorento Over the Honda. Gas mileage is the same on both Please don't get me wrong, I like the Honda, and have no plans on trading. What I'm saying is that for the dollar I think the Sorento is a better value for your money. And the hundred thousand mile warranty is unbeatable .","268":"Bought this Sorento 8 months ago, and we've driven it every day around town and taken it on cross-country touring.  We're very, very pleased.  This is no 1990's Kia.  My previous car was an Audi A8L - a very premium car - and I'm actually more comfortable in the Sorento.  I know these two cars are not really comparable, but for what it's worth, the Sorento is a quieter, smoother and more enjoyable vehicle.  (OK, so it's not as fast, and it doesn't take corners the same; but it does what I need it to do, flawlessly).  A non-quantifiable assessment that's perhaps most germane:  This car makes me smile.  (And not just because it cost half of what I paid for the Audi).  It is a really nice piece of machinery.  \n\nThe little engine has ample power for an SUV; and I saw 27 mpg overall in our cross-country trip, including short stop and go forays in several cities.  (Around 22 in town; averaging almost 24).  \n\nThe huge panoramic sunroof is fun.  \n\nThe longer we drive it, the more unexpected positives we discover.  The active speed control is fantastic; keeps distance from car ahead and slows to a full stop if necessary, then starts again without touching accelerator (unless you're stopped more than 20 seconds).  Blind spot warning is flawless.  The lane keep assist warning is helpful.  Automatic opening hatch has been a real help when carrying groceries, etc.  The downloadable apps are useful.  The voice recognition actually recognizes words (a lot better than my Audi).  The sound system with the tech package is pretty good.  Especially down here in Dallas, the cooled front seats are a happy surprise.  \n\nObviously, I'm not swayed by those who insist on a luxury brand.  I deeply appreciate quality, regardless of its author.  Give me the genuine experience of excellence over a label any day.","269":"The SUV is awesome the driver door will work with the fab i have to crawl across the seats & console 8000 miles KIA Corp made would not give a rental and it is $45700.00 SXL V6 Napa Leather and Kia corp said how do we know until we look at it! they would not even send a roll back to pick up the vehicle i have spinal issues thats why my husband wanted me to have this SUV heated seats & cooled seats so i dont over heat because i have other health issues, then they offered $35.00 a day for 2 days rental we front the money. Kia does not care they showed that! We bought 3 new high end Kia's in 2 1\/2 weeks and they kick us in the face. To much road noise!","270":"Test drove this vehicle today with my wife as she is looking to replace our 2001 Honda CR-V SE. Dealer did not have the lower priced model we wished to drive (SX V-6), so we test drove the SX V-6 which listed at $40+k. Less then 5 minutes into the test drive in a 55 mph zone at 55, my wife said take it back. The wind noise was terrible!! And worse than in our 16 year old 97000 mile CR-V. The salesperson was polite and courteous; the vehicle was well appointed, great instrumentation, handled, rode, and drove well, and was well finished, but for their top of the line model, the wind noise was totally unacceptable. We buy our automobiles carefully and plan for them to last. Current daily drivers are the 2001 Honda CR-V and a 2002 Lexus LS430. My hearing is impaired due to firing black powder long guns without proper ear protection, but the wind noise bothered me as much as it did my wife. Prior test drives within the past couple of weeks have included both the 2016 Toyota Highlander and the 2015 Honda CR-V; both of which had no significant wind noise at 60+ mph and were well appointed. My low ratings are due to the unacceptability of the wind noise knowing that over the time we would own this car, it would not improve. Would not recommend if wind noise bothers you.","271":"I had a bmw 328i before and traded it in for 2016 Sorento Sx V6. Although I don't use the 3rd row often I have filled it up w 6 people including myself 2 on each row. My guests said very comfortable. My bmw was boring compared to the sorento. The value is great I got all bells and whistles for a lesser price getting the SX Fwd. Before sorento I was thinking of getting Tacoma but then I thought A truck with a bed I don't even tow 99% of the times! Sorento has excellent interior very upscale Kia. Kia is coming up nasty!","272":"i purchased a 2014 Sorento v6, and drove it for over a year, and really enjoyed the vehicle. Then i saw the lines on the 2016, and thought it was a big improvement on style, so I traded up. First time I used the GPS it took me to the wrong location. I also found that the font size could not be changed on the Navigation, and a lot of the street names did not appear, so it was a big mistake paying for that feature. I also liked the blind spot lights on the mirrors, but in 2016 they are smaller, and dimmer, and in sunlight almost useless. I could not believe that something that worked so well was changed drastically on the 2016. I mentioned this to Kia by phone, and the attitude was very poor.\n I did get the 4 with turbo, which is ample for me, but like someone else mentioned, the mileage is not that much better then the 6. The only other problem that has happen twice, is after starting the car, radio would not work, until you stopped the engine, and restarted. I have not had time to check with the dealer on that issue yet, but will on next visit. Yes on a long trip this summer, it was a pleasure to drive across the country.\n\n Did something different this year, a week ago saw the Subaru Outback, and after checking out features, and gas mileage, traded the Sorento in, was not happy with the blind spot lights on the mirrors ( not visible as well in daylight ) and still disappointed with the GPS, have had the Subaru now for a couple weeks, and so far get 29 mpg combined, and a much better GPS , and blind spot lights much better, so i do still like the Kia, with praise for the ride, but the safety features are a welcome addition to my driving with the Outback. I got the 4 cylinder engine 175 hp, and am happy with the performance.","273":"Great car!  Drives very smoothly, and the gas mileage is great for an SUV.  The interior feels very upscale.  It is quite comfortable.  If not for riding so high, you would think you were in a regular car.  I am very happy, except for the infotainment system and navigation.  First, you cannot change the home screen.  It automatically defaults to navigation every time you turn on the car.  I don't know about most people, but I'm not using navigation on a day-to-day basis, so I really don't need a map visible at all times.  So, every time I get into the car, I have to switch the view to the radio\/satellite screen.  Why can't I choose that as my default, Kia?  Second, there are 18 presets for the satellite, and you have to scroll through all 18 (or go backwards) to get back to the beginning.  Not the end of the world, but kind of annoying.  I ended up choosing 6 stations and programming each in three times so I can scroll through without having to go backwards.  Also, the volume function is not responsive--no chance of turning the volume up or down quickly.  You can spin it as fast as you want, but it still raises and lowers at the same speed.  Finally, the Bluetooth works great.  It connects immediately.  However, the voice-activated phone book is a disaster.  It rarely recognizes the name I say.  It's almost not worth using.  So, there are kinks in the infotainment system, but all-in-all, I am happy with my Sorento.","274":"Initial impression...very positive.  I have driven full sized trucks for a number of years and was ready for something a bit more economical while retaining some utility.  I was drawn to the size of the Sorento, not as small as other utes but not full sized either.  Similar in size to my father's Highlander but MUCH less expensive.  I am impressed with the fuel economy - 29 on interstate, approx. 22 in town...averaging 24.5 currently.  Back seat is roomy.  Back up camera turns with the car, nice feature.  Much more room and quieter than my wife's RAV4 with similar economy.  My only nagging item is a significant delay when using the Bluetooth phone dialing function.  I am going to \"resave\" some of my more frequently utilized contacts to see if that helps.  Phone clarity is good, just placing the call takes time.  The warranty was a selling feature and I got a really good deal at Fredy Kia in Houston, TX.  I have installed a Curt 2\" hitch but I have not yet installed the wiring kit or towed anything.","275":"The Kia Sorento SUV, V6, is my kind of car.  It is what I traded in to get another one.  It has get up and go when you need it.  It handles well and has amazing safety features.  I really love the blind spot sensors.  The car rides well and is very comfortable.  It will hold all 5 of my grandkids with plenty of room for their stuff.  Cowboy Kia in Conroe, Texas, has a wonderful Customer Service Department.  They listened to me and helped me find the car I wanted.  It took awhile to find light colored interior, but I got it.  I look forward to having this car for a long time and getting my money's worth out of it for sure.  I test drove both the V6 and Turbo.  The V6 had the power I wanted and that's what I got.  I am very excited about my new car!","276":"Buying decision came down to 2016 Ford Edge Titanium or 2016 Kia Sorento EX Premium. Actually preferred the Edge, but not to the tune of a $5500+ price difference. Driving feel is very good with ample storage and easy to use controls. Put 1100 miles on in the first 10 days without any issues. Hard to beat the warranty.\nAfter 1 yr of ownership, car runs well. Front seats are too firm for long trip comfort, and sound system is underpowered, but no major issues to date.","277":"This WAS a \"first impression\" review, and I advised: so take it for what it is worth. THIS is an update, and impressions have improved. We acquired our 2016 Sorento V6 AWD SXL a few weeks (one year, now) ago in order to accommodate towing a boat that we want to purchase soon.  The other 'driver' for buying an SUV is a very active daughter with many types of gear associated with her many activities.  \n\nMy first impression based upon extensive research, is that the Kia DOES live up to its promise of being trouble free\/high quality.  This vehicle has nearly every option, including lane-departure warning, cruise control with anti-collision technology, multiple setting for steering, AWD, touch-less rear hatch opening, etc. etc.  All of which have revealed themselves as easy-to-use, intuitive, and helpful.  This is a much larger car than my wife and I are accustomed to as we have both been driving Ford C-Max Energis for the past two years (also excellent vehicles and nearly gas-free).  Despite the increased size (over what we are accustomed to), the Kia Sorento is easily managed in town, and even more precise (perhaps the AWD at work?).  I'm quite impressed with how it tracks so well around corners and does so with little or no body-roll.  I find particularly useful in the narrow confines of my work-place's garage, and the recent wet, leaf-strewn condition in our city.  Tremendous confidence.  For updated impressions, I would also point out that the transmission's three modes: 'sport,' 'eco,' and regular are highly functional and very distinct.  Toggling into sport mode gets excellent grunt, power, response.  Econgets us 302-35 on the highways, and a welcome 27 MPG overall.\n\nInside, we went all-out.  We like comfort, but we do not like the Lexus\/BMW \"costs\" to enjoy them.  This vehicle has it all--heated\/ventilated front seats--heated rear seats, panoramic sun-roof, Navigation, satellite radio, integrated voice commands, streaming, endlessly-adjustable driver's & front seats, heated steering wheel (unnecessary, but now that I \"know\" this luxury--how could i have ever lived without it??;)), large and easy-to-use navigation screen which incorporates many other features, though the voice commands can be slow, reclining rear seats that scoot back and forth as necessary, good storage and convenient cubbies for electronics, excellent interior lighting, and two additional third-row seats when necessary.  I like to describe the Sorrento as an extremely comfortable and functional 5-seat SUV with a 2-seat bonus in the third row.  We don't think we will use the 3rd row much, but when not in use, the cargo area is more than adequate for the kid's gear, and the requisite swim-team equipment that we religiously tote around all summer for swim-meets.  The 3rd row is more comfortable and roomier than the Chrysler Pacifica's, and the Mazda 5's--both cars we've owned in the past.   \n\nAcceleration is perfectly adequate.  We don't buy into the idea that we need a 'fast' car, nor that we need to beat other drivers on the road, and have adopted a culture of conservation throughout our lifestyle.  So, a V6 and MPG below 45 is a compromise for us (My wife has averaged 138 MPG in her Cmax during the past two years since around-town we use only electric mode; i've averaged 79 with more out-of-town trips in mine).  The Sorento comes with an EPA MPG of 17 in-town with AWD.  Our first tank rendered 23.5 mpg.  That's better than our old Mazda 5.  Today, one year later, we are astonished at the Kia's efficiency.  Long drives up I5 consistently return 30+ mpg.  I marvel at the efficiency.\n\nWe hope our first impressions hold.  The buying experience was very pressure free, and we got some good incentives.  the final prices was more than 10% below MSRP, and the Kia processing was dignified--no high pressure efforts to sell us crud we do not need, and we didn't walk away from the dealership feeling like we'd been 'had.'  I think with Kia's high quality scores, these cars pretty much sell themselves.","278":"We purchased a 2012 Sorento LX a few years ago and loved it.  The wife used it for work and traveling back and forth from Houston to New Orleans several times a year. One tank got there straight through. It has held up quite well. No engine trouble due to regular maintenance. We just traded that 2012 in for a 2016 Sorento SX because when you take in every thing, they just give you so much for your money. Very spacious because we have boys with long legs, interior feels like a luxury car, they have cool alloy rims, panoramic sun roof, big screen Infinity radio with Navigation and a sub woofer. Leather seats, separate climate control, 19 \" tires and full size spare. The funny thing is , I own a 2013 Sportage and my son a 2015 Forte. We bought them from the same dealership because of the great service, and when go to get our oil change there as well. Even side by side against other SUV's , it stands out and stays very stylish and most of all reliable.","279":"Bought my 1st Kia over the weekend (2016 Sorento) and couldn't be happier. This car is beautiful inside and out and I'm just amazed on how much you get for your money. Thanks again Trevor at Gay Family Kia for finding me the perfect car for me and the great service.","280":"Love my 2016 KIA Sorento but,  a tree branch went through our windshield our first winter storm.  It has been almost 7 weeks now and our body shop has been unable to get parts. We have also been told that our local dealer does not have the proper equipment to test the electronics on the 2016 models! We haven't even had our first oil change!","281":"I started searching over a year ago for the best 3 row SUV that was affordable, great looking, and gas worthy.  I first liked the Rogue but quickly changed my mind on that.  It has great gas mileage but the third row was ridiculous.  The new Rogue has the second row raised as if you are sitting in a movie theatre.  I hated that and it felt really strange being higher up than the front row.  That was a deal breaker for me.  The Murano is over priced and so is the Pathfinder.  The Pathfinder was gorgeous but the base model doesn't have the basics like blue tooth and Sirius Radio.  The next trim model that offered it was 6,000 more.  The Pathfinder also received weak reviews for reliability.  I drove the Mazda 9 and loved it but the extremely low gas mileage (combined) is only 16.  That's unacceptable for a car like that.  One would think Mazda would make a car with better gas mileage.  I also drove the Highlander and it has a lot of room, but I felt it over priced and not very attractive.  I do remember driving a 2014 Kia Sorento and was not impressed back then.  However, I read the Sorento was getting a face lift so I went and checked it out.  What a surprise.  It is gorgeous and the fit and finish is great.  I read all reviews on all SUVs and took the time to finally select the 2016 Kia Sorento.  I love it.  It feels like a luxury car and it is very quiet.  Kia has come a long way with their line of cars and SUVs.  I have one in Black with a black interior.  I am a picky shopper and I am glad I purchased the new design.","282":"After much research & test drives of both the turbo 4 & the direct injection 6, we finally optioned for a SX V6. We did not option the Limited as we thought the extra cost for all the \"I'm an idiot\" driver aids are not warranted, After all , when your driving , shouldn't you be ....driving!. The SX V6 is comfortable car, SX comes with a panoramic roof & that is a major feature of the car, It has plenty of power, is very comfortable & can tow 5000lbs.  I am already a Kia owner & we had not had any issues on that so far, & the fact that this car has the same warranty is most re-assuring. It is great to be under warranty when the car is finally paid off!. I got a great deal using \"TRUECAR\" & also rcvd 0% finance too, The cabin is quiet, even at highway speeds & even with standard 19\" wheels, The literature states acoustic glass & this must help in keeping the noise down. The seat are comfy & driver's is power adjustable with memory presets, so great for the Mrs. The passenger is also power adjustable , but without added lumbar & thigh adjustability. Smart power lift gate, my personal favorite, with this option engaged, you stand behind the car with the keyfob in your pocket & after 3 seconds , the rear hatch opens, no waving your leg under the car with your hand full, such a great function. So far so impressed & so happy with the purchase.","283":"Do your homework.  The only things I miss in the technology area is a compass, the front passenger seat has no height adjustment, remote start is not standard equipment.  There is a lot of stuff I will never use.  We were looking for an SUV with lots of leg room in front and this has it, an impressive 44 inches.  Way more than others, even Jeep.  Another selling point was the 60,000 mile warranty.  Mileage is outstanding.  I drive mostly highway and am averaging 31-33 mpg combined in Eco Mode.  On my way home from the dealership I was in Standard Mode and got 31.8 mpg for the 75 mile trip. \n\nOverall we love this vehicle.  Comfortable and quiet.  Winter in Iowa will be the real test!\n\nUpdate:  It will soon be 2 years, we still love this Sorento.  No issues whatsoever.  I thought there was an issue with heater fan, took it in and the compartment was full of acorns!  Simple fix!  Darn ground squirrels!  Will keep it for a long time.","284":"Being a nurse, I needed a car that would be reliable enough to get me to work in all weather. I am beyond pleased with this car and saying I'm obsessed would be an understatement.","285":"we were looking for an economical lease and after test driving a Chevy traverse, mazda cx9 and the kia, we felt the kia had the best ride and most features for basically being a base model. the 4 cylinder is more than enough powerful and very good on gas.  This car was at least 100 dollars a month cheaper than the other options with more features.  as far as negatives go they are very small.....the trunk button on the key fob does not pop open the trunk,  it just unlocks it which is kinda annoying because with my other cars if you press the trunk release, the trunk pops open. other than that great driving car with great features at a great price.","286":"Everything is as advertised. Love the list of features. The problem I have is there is rattling coming from the passenger side of the sun roof. There were 2 areas rattling. Brought to the dealer and after 4 days the vehicle was returned. The say they adjusted the sunroof. It 90% repaired one rattle. Still appears when  the sun is on the roof  the other rattle coming from the area of the sunroof and passenger side. They did hear it. It happens when driving over rough  roads (which in Massachusetts are easy to find) after confering with the \"help desk of kia\" they told me it is a carteristic of this vehicle for a 46k$ Vehicle it is unacceptable beware of this problem. If you are looking at the sorento  test drive it first over rough roads.","287":"15 Months of ownership and my original opinion of the Sorento still stands.  Quiet, comfortable with no compromises.  Completely satisfied with my purchase!\n\n*****************************************************************************\nAfter endless hours of online comparisons, expert and consumer reviews, I finally narrowed my Premium Midsize CUV search.  We test drove MDX, RX, Limited Highlander, Platinum Murano, and Sorento SXL V6.   (Not a fan of domestic brands and European makers rides too stiff) In a nut shell all vehicle had attributes, but we decided on the Sorento for the following reasons:\n\nThe right size - perfect size for my family; with an emergency 3rd row as needed.  A full suite of safety and luxury amenities, that are second to none of the aforementioned CUV's.  Exceptional ride quality with a hushed cabin, second by a slim margin to the RX (which looks dated).  Controls are intuitive and uncluttered - equal, if not superior to the Murano (exterior too radical for my taste).  Exceptional warranty - Basic 5 Year 60,000 miles\/10 Year 100,000 mile Power Train; superior to all brands.  Thousands of dollars less than a comparably equipped luxury brand and sacrificed nothing...well maybe brand snobbery.  \n\nFavorite Features - Large Panoramic Sunroof, exceptional connectivity and Infinity sound system with clarify, Surround View Monitor, ride quality and Smart Lift Gate and Enhanced Smart Cruise Control.  No brand snobbery.  I could go on but no need.\n\nSmall improvements - Power tilt telescoping missing (manual only)  Forward Collision Auto Braking (Only audible warning)","288":"We just purchased a 2016 Kia Sorento SX V6 model and for the most part are really impressed with the vehicle. I could go on a write about great everything is but there are small details that I am really upset about. One of them being the lack of interior lights on the sunroof\/reading lights. They do not light up and can be very hard to see at night. I know it\u0092s small but when spend this kind of money that\u0092s something you would expect. My 2010 VW has it. The biggest complaint has to do with the Lack of Daytime Running lights. There are none. Your options are \u0093auto\u0094 which turns on everything when it gets dark, or you have to manually turn on your lights for daytime. Really Kia? No LEDs on a 20","289":"CONTEXT: Husband\/Wife in the market for 1 year | Previously owned 2 gens of Durangos |  | We're mid 40s | 1 dog | value: comfort, safety, reliability, styling | Our other car is a '12 Merc E350.\r\n\r\nCOMPARED: (over 1 year): Buick (heavy, boat-y drive), Highlander (perfect features, HORRIBLE boaty drive), VW Tourag (great drive, way over priced), Jeep GC (decent drive, great features, overpriced), Infinity Q (this was our 2nd choice; it lost out based on drive quality)....and 5 others. \r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE: We've had it only 3 weeks: Taken onto beach (sand, up steep hills; no traction loss), local mountain roads (handled great!), to work; -44 mile commute (PRISTINE comfort!!), DateNight (Luxury!)","290":"We traded in our 2012 SX for a new 2016 SXL with the turbo 4. The improvements are many and measurable. The ride quality being number 1. The ride is much quiter and it takes bumps and potholes so much easier. The steering feel is stiffer and feedback is noticable, way better than previous models.The inside is much roomier and way more comfortable. The display for the backup camera and navigation is brighter and much easier to see and read in sunlight. *updated* We have taken three long trips in this now and on the highway going 70MPH, we averaged around 27MPG with AWD..impressive and an extremely comfortable ride. This thing continues to impress. *update* We've had this vehicle for 2 years now and still love it as much as day 1. There have been a few recalls, but nothing that has effected our driveability or schedules. They have all been done during routine maintenance calls. They have also upgraded the sound system now to include Apple Carplay and Android Auto.","291":"This car is basically everything I was looking for. All the bells and whistles and practically new. Loaded with leather and panoramic sunroof, cooled seats, lots of room, etc.","292":"Larger than other comparable suv's. Bells and whistles are a lot of dollars and cents, so if you don't have to have them it's a great value of a car.","293":"I did some research on these vehicles before the purchase   and was surprised at the favorable reviews, I have owned it for a little over 2 weeks and I love it. I now am driving for Uber and I get many comments from my customers about it. I highly recommend this vehicle.","294":"I have had SUV's for more than 20 years ranging in different models except Ford.. ewwww. My most recent SUV was a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and I loved it but it was time to get a newer model and the price was a little out of my range so I decided to stop and check out the 2015 Sorento and I was amazed on how well it handled and the power that the 4 cyl produced and actually it performed better than my  Jeep. The comfort is great and I could not find anything that would stop me from buying it in which I did do. So with 32000 Miles on it I have the balance of the factory 5\/60 B2B  and 10\/100 on the power train was the selling point. I have had it now since Sept. 2015 and the only thing is the road noise but this may be due to the All Season Mastercraft tires I have on and depends on what kind of surface the road is.  Great gas mileage. This is 1 Great Vehicle. Update on the noise. I have since switched from Mastercraft to General Grabber STX and the noise has subsided and now even a smoother ride so 15 months after purchase I still love my Kia and have no complaints..","295":"Bought this used, has some warranty left.  Rides nice, but like most front wheel drive if you accelerate rapidly be ready for the initial pull to the left.  Six cylinder is a must, nice performance, quiet ride.  Interior is a bit on the cheap side, but has ac outlet for rear seats which is nice.  Third row is tight only for the emergency day carrying extra children, but then there is zero storage.  Also rear climate control is nice.  Heated seats a plus.","296":"Beautiful car inside and out.  It's fun to drive.  It's used with 36,000 miles but it does have a 5 year\/60000 warranty intact.  Priced well.  My biggest complaint is the fuel economy.  It has a 18 gallon tank and it goes through that really fast.  I'm thinking the 4 cylinder engine is just too small for the weight of the truck.  It just drags on acceleration.  I have to punch it to go up hills.  I get 16mpg in the city\/hwy is about 24mpg so the claims that the manufacturer makes are false (probably only best case scenario).  If you get one, buy the V6.  It's only a couple $$$$ more and probably worth the extra cost - I wish I had.","297":"I own three Fords (Ford 1999 V10 short bed, Ford 2005 Expedition and a Ford 2004 Escape) and one Honda Civic.  I was after my newer Ford Escape and was disappointed in it's lack of performance in the engine which is smaller and the smaller interior.  I was impressed by the Kia's fuel saving Economy (I bought a Hertz Former Rental 2015 Kia Sorento GDI), overall comfort with heated seats (came in really handy with our freezing cold snow), rear backup camera, and cargo space.  I have slid on black ice three times now and the Kia held to the road and navigated with ease even backing over my snow covered driveway.  I love the satellite stereo and blue tooth capabilities plus the window shades for passengers.","298":"This is my second Kia Sorento , my first one was a 2011 EX V6 which I liked very much and had very good luck with, not one single complaint. I put 36500 miles on it and it run perfectly for me gave me good gas mileage and no problems, it was AWD by the way and when it came time to trade I received good resale value. I take very good care of my vehicles, and by the way I dealt with two different dealers I bought my 2011 from one dealer and I leased my 2015 from a different dealer and will say that they both are top of the line dealers couldn't be happier, they are both excellent when it comes to service and getting things done. When I leased my 2015 which is a SXL AWD V6 I noticed that on rougher roads which we have a lot of them around here in NE Iowa especially in the spring time after the frost comes out, that it had a thumping noise like it was coming from the right front, like a strut or something that wasn't right, I could feel it through the floor even like it was metal on metal. I stopped at the dealer and told them about it so they had one of their experts ride with me on good roads and he even admitted that he could tell that it was doing it. So it was decided that when I brought it in for my 5000 mile maintenance that they would check it over and try and fix the problem which they did, and they also found a leak of coolant that they fixed. I was very happy and couldn't say enough good about the excellent service that I got there first class for sure. I liked my first Sorento the 2011 very much no complaints, I love this 2015 SXL what a nice vehicle for the money, and when you consider the warranty price and features for your dollar it is very hard to beat KIA. Only thing that I would like is just a little more room in back for my golf clubs it is a little tight, but of course KIA is one step ahead of me along comes the 2016 Sorento with the extra room, looks like I will need to update again soon.","299":"So, I felt I did my research on this vehicle, and for the most part I did.  When I read everyone\u0092s review, to include Edmond\u0092s review, I felt good about my purchase, initially! My major complaint is the road noise.  It is horrendous!!  If your town\/city roads have smooth asphalt\/concrete, then you won\u0092t mind\/notice the road noise.  However, the city I live in mainly has coarse (small pebble\/shell) asphalt roads.  I think it is important to note though the roads in my city are smooth, but are coarse.  The road noise is terrible.  The noise contrast is really noticeable when I drive over recently repaired (new asphalt) areas on the road.  ","300":"This is my 2nd Sorento (We had a 2012 also).  I love this car!  It was great when the grandkids visited .  The 3rd seat is meant for them.  We have the sx model with all the bells and whistles.  The acceleration of the V6 is very good and the quality of the interior is nice.","301":"This is my third actually. I had my 2004 Sorento LX for 10.5 years and it was more reliable than ANY vehicle I have ever owned. So I traded for a 2015. I've only had it for 2 1\/2 years and 14k miles but it's great! Average mileage running mostly city and in eco setting is 21. Still getting used to the back-up camera and some of the options I've never had before but those heated seats are wonderful!","302":"Our family is thrilled with our 2015 KIA Sorento Ex.   It is an absolute pleasure to drive.  The extra row of seats in back is a wonderful addition. Surprisingly roomy in 2nd row.  The responsiveness of voice program and sound system along with other techno gadgets are great! Incredible Steering..will turn as sharp as a motorcycle!!!  First week went on a trip, drove it a thousand miles through interstate and city traffic in Orlando and it got a hard to believe average of 26 mpg..Yes this is a keeper!!!!! To top it off the rear view camera makes handling the SUV easy as pie.  WOW I could say more. ..this was thoughtfully made --a great deal!  Thanks KIA! We are sooo happy!  Update..still agree with above just wished they enabled side beeper warnings to help with blind spots on all model and auto litigate on all their SUV","303":"the 2015 Sorento LX FWD is a attractive suv for woman. It's not really a mans suv unless it's a top of the line Limited model. It's very much so a plastic suv. For a $30,000 suv everything that's not a seat cushion shouldn't look and be hard plastics. The back up camera & sensors works great. The instrument cluster looks amazing with the red and white. The plastic wood look, looks great on the doors but not on the dashboard or on the center console. The gas needle and the range to empty doesn't really add up correctly the range to empty says 325 to E for a full tank but according to the internet I suppose to get 348 to E for a full tank. ","304":"Purchased a 2015 for my wife and after 1400 miles we are still only getting 14 to 18 mpg. Kia says it has a break in period and that we should be getting 20 to 27 mpg after 3000 miles. We only purchased this car because of the mpg's we thought we were going to get, should have just kept our 07 Honda CRV. After a few years we will be getting rid of this vehicle and won't look at Kia again. ","305":"I'm a loyal Toyota customer, but I wanted to see what other car makers had to offer. So I test drove a number or SUV's from Toyota, Mazda, Ford, Subaru & Nissan. And the 2015 Sorento impressed me so much that I stopped looking. It's the perfect size, it rides great (better than most other SUV's), very comfortable, great standard feature & options. Very good quality all around, great warranty and I'm getting about 26mpg city & highway combined. When you compare the price and quality of the Sorento to other SUV's. Sorento wins. ","306":"I really love my Sorento. Best car I have ever owned.\nAlways wanted one and now I got it.\nI am planning on buying a pontoon boat only 16ft.\nThe dry weight is 1620 without motor.\nThe maximum towing capacity is 1650.\nI wonder if that will make a difference.\nReally hoping it doesn't because I love my Sorento"},"thumbsUpDownCounter":{"1":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"2":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"3":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"4":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"5":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"6":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":7},"7":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":3},"8":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":14},"9":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"10":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":6},"11":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":12},"12":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":22},"13":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":19},"14":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":20},"15":{"thumbsDown":25,"thumbsUp":7},"16":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"17":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":0},"18":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"19":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"20":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"21":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":2},"22":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"23":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"24":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"25":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":2},"26":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"27":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":8},"28":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"29":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":2},"30":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":6},"31":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":12},"32":{"thumbsDown":37,"thumbsUp":7},"33":{"thumbsDown":14,"thumbsUp":13},"34":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":21},"35":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"36":{"thumbsDown":9,"thumbsUp":34},"37":{"thumbsDown":17,"thumbsUp":24},"38":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":39},"39":{"thumbsDown":11,"thumbsUp":30},"40":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":1},"41":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":14},"42":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":3},"43":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":3},"44":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":7},"45":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":9},"46":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":21},"47":{"thumbsDown":19,"thumbsUp":14},"48":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":14},"49":{"thumbsDown":10,"thumbsUp":3},"50":{"thumbsDown":7,"thumbsUp":35},"51":{"thumbsDown":6,"thumbsUp":9},"52":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":23},"53":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":19},"54":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":3},"55":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":30},"56":{"thumbsDown":8,"thumbsUp":8},"57":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":23},"58":{"thumbsDown":16,"thumbsUp":12},"59":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"60":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"61":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"62":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"63":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"64":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":0},"65":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"66":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"67":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"68":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"69":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"70":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"71":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"72":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"73":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":0},"74":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":3},"75":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"76":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"77":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":13},"78":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":10},"79":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":10},"80":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":6},"81":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":6},"82":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":0},"83":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":0},"84":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"85":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":27},"86":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":3},"87":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":1},"88":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"89":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":4},"90":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":7},"91":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"92":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":1},"93":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":39},"94":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":19},"95":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":11},"96":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":9},"97":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":20},"98":{"thumbsDown":8,"thumbsUp":6},"99":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"100":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":9},"101":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":22},"102":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":10},"103":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":14},"104":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":17},"105":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":11},"106":{"thumbsDown":5,"thumbsUp":24},"107":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":12},"108":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":24},"109":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":7},"110":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":16},"111":{"thumbsDown":11,"thumbsUp":15},"112":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":26},"113":{"thumbsDown":22,"thumbsUp":17},"114":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":20},"115":{"thumbsDown":8,"thumbsUp":23},"116":{"thumbsDown":9,"thumbsUp":31},"117":{"thumbsDown":25,"thumbsUp":16},"118":{"thumbsDown":13,"thumbsUp":45},"119":{"thumbsDown":6,"thumbsUp":24},"120":{"thumbsDown":8,"thumbsUp":41},"121":{"thumbsDown":15,"thumbsUp":40},"122":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":0},"123":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":12},"124":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":11},"125":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"126":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"127":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":2},"128":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":24},"129":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":12},"130":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":16},"131":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":10},"132":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":7},"133":{"thumbsDown":13,"thumbsUp":15},"134":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":6},"135":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":47},"136":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":41},"137":{"thumbsDown":15,"thumbsUp":34},"138":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"139":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp"
