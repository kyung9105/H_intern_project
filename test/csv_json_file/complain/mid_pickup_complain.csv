Next time in to dealer and they replaced the wiring harness that was part of recall. Seem to work fine for a while then started happening again.It appeared to be related to vehicle sitting out in the rain overnight so I made sure to park in garage when raining. Seemed to work but again problem has resurfaced without rain.Basically you enter vehicle as usual and press start button and the main display starts going through a number of error messages and the truck won't start. I turn everything off and try again. Same effect. And again. Same thing. Being persistent and having to get somewhere I continue to try and after usually a dozen attempts it starts. While fine then. Error messages still appear but everything seems to be function correctly. As day goes on, error messages seem to autocorrect and disappear and within an hour or two its like it never happened. It might be good for a couple of days or a month then bang, back to same issue.This last time I have tried over 20 start processes and still no luck.

Also if riding between 20-40 mph the vehicle rides at a very low RPM (~1100) and shimmies the vehicle like it will stall. Vehicle will also ""noticeably"" down shift while the foot is off the accelerator resulting in an unexpected change in deceleration. The problem seems to be getting worse and now the shifting is starting to jolt the vehicle. While driving at constant speeds the vehicle will randomly surge high in rpms then come right back down. The vehicle is presenting unsafe conditions. Took the vehicle to the dealer multiple times. 1st time they topped off the transmission fluid as it was low from the factory. 2nd time they are aware of the issue and others were having it as well and the transmission ECU was re-flashed. This still did not resolve the problem. Brought the vehicle back a 3rd time and they didn't see a problem with the vehicle. Brought it back a 4th time to be seen by a field specialist and the issue could be duplicated but there is no fix at this time because the vehicle is operating as designed.

The following business day after taking delivery I brought to dealer with the above complaints and was told that the computer needed to lean my driving style and it would take up to 5,000 miles. At one point dealership service tech, service adviser, and service manager acknowledged the problems and I was told that Toyota was already aware and working on a flash upgrade that they hoped would fix. I was told that I had no choice but to drive the vehicle and wait for the flash. Dealership personnel now deny any problems. I filed a claim with Toyota and dealer now refuses to try and fix the problems. This model is being shipped with very low transmission fluid according to the service tech which is certain to diminish the life of the transmission.

69,engine,piston_knocking,Puerto,Rico,Jan 01,"Automatic transmission-8,000 miles","2nd Complaint I've got on my ""new"" truck.Piston knocking/slapping when the truck accelerates from around 1200RPM @40MPH.First things First: I'm using 91 to 93 oct Gas since day 1.It started doing it uphill, since the transmission shifts too soon, sometimes when going uphill the RPM's drop
under 2000. When I step on the pedal to accelerate it . .. Piston knocking right away for a few seconds, then it stops. Whenever the truck goes under the 1200RPM and I need to accelerate again, it knocks. And I'm not confusing this sound with the valve sound (the sewing machine sound) that Toyota still saying that ""it's normal"". I know what piston knock/slap is and that sound can't be confused. At first I thought I was a casual thing, but it started to doing it even on the Highway.According to the advantages of an Atkinson Engine: piston knocking is virtually ""impossible"" or less likely to happen because of the Direct Injection system. When fuel injection happens inside the chamber it is supposed to cool it down to prevent pre-ignition due to overheating. I hope to got this right. Well, if it is not a matter of high temperatures at the combustion chamber, then could it be a too lean air/fuel mixture. And this could explain that hesitation feeling when accelerating/lugging the engine. We know now that there's an under power feeling due to the transmission shifting too soon to higher gears, but this might a stacking issue as well.Things I found weird....MPG. Frequently this truck is giving me more than 28MPG. That's weird. I mean, or something is f.ckd up, or the MPG calculations are wrong or the ECU just want to save fuel or run the truck with air only ?I took the truck to the dealer, and guess what ? They didn't find a thing and they've stated that my truck is on spec.

I was a little concerned so when I actually received the truck I took a long test drive and the truck was smooth as glass, no vibrations present. I figured that this must have been a few GMC sales guys posting. Turns out, I was very wrong and all V6 engines either have the vibration at delivery or will develop it down the road. Biggest regret and worst vehicle I ever owned.So where is the vibration coming from? Turns out, Toyota used cheap rubber engine mounts on this $41,000 truck. When the engine breaks in it settles and the vibration comes from the engine shifting between Atkinson and Otto cycles to save fuel. Ironically, Toyota took this engine from the Lexus which uses both electronic and hydraulic engine mounts.

93,engine,vibration_in_floor_and_steering,CO,US,Oct 08,Automatic transmission-10 miles,"My new 2016 Tacoma has a nasty, pronounced buzzing vibration in the steering wheel, gas pedal, and floorbed when accelerating through 2,000-2,500 RPMs. The buzzing vibration is best described as having your hands and foot on a powerful sanding machine. It is powerful enough to carry through to your skin and clothes. Now there are weaker buzzing vibrations in the steering wheel and gas pedal in other ranges from 1,000-2,000 RPMs. When you're driving through mountain or hilly terrain for long distances, the engine often works for long periods in the peak 2,000-2,500 range; the resonant vibration is so intense and uncomfortable that I find myself having to drive with two little fingers on the wheels, constantly rotating, and finding ways to put it in cruise control so I can get my foot off the gas pedal.I have had my truck evaluated by the service department and Toyota corporate multiple times since October. They say it's ""engine resonance."" The last update I received from Toyota Corporate claimed that, ""for now, this is a normal characteristic"" of the truck because others they evaluated had the same issue, though they concede to a lesser extent than mine. So the corporate logic goes something like this: most trucks have the same ""issue"" to some degree; ergo, it is not a problem but rather ""normal and characteristic""--a ""feature,"" if you will. Imagine paying $38K+ for a cup of coffee that started leaking all over you the minute you walked out the door. You go back in to the coffee shop to point it out. The barista tries another cup that also leaks (maybe it's a better cup because it doesn't leak so bad). The barista then logically concludes ""this other cup leaks so it's normal!"" Leaky is the new normal! The bottom line: that a preponderance of trucks exhibit an issue does not make it ""normal"" and erase the fact that there may be a serious problem.To make matters worse, I have test-drove many other 2016 Tacoma models that do not have a hint of this issue. I only found it on one of the many I test drove, and that one had it so minor no normal person would notice it. I'd be happy to have it at that level on my truck. So because this strong vibration is present on my truck and is a ""normal characteristic,"" the non-vibrating trucks are ""abnormal"" and ""uncharacteristic.""I had a 2014 Tacoma that never had anything close to this issue. It was awesome. I am disappointed by Toyota's carefully crafted and downplayed response to this issue so far and hope they do the right thing and fix this soon. For others considering the 2016 Tacoma, be sure to thoroughly test drive your truck before taking delivery. But also be forewarned that many others had it develop after a few hundred miles after driving it off the lot.

This equates to many of the freeway speeds of 70 or high 70's that you travel in my area and I travelled 250 miles from Flagstaff, AZ to Las Vegas and my hands went to sleep from the steering wheel buzzy vibration. Really noticeable in the 5th or 6th speeds in the automatic transmission, which are both overdrives. Took it to the dealer and the master Tech said he noticed it in other trucks of the same model, too. Said the problem may just be 'normal' for this vehicle. Agreed that it was not acceptable and thought Toyota would have to either re-design the engine/trans mounts or provide some way to dampen this. Have tested it around town and found it to be in all gears. Dealer recommended that I call Toyota directly as there is nothing they can do. This is supposedly a completely 'redesigned' model with a new engine and tranny. Checking on various forums, it seems that many people with automatic transmissions and 4x2's of any trim and 4x4's of Limiteds and Sport models have this issue in one way or another and the only model that seems to not have it is the 4x4 Off-Road model. I wonder if this is because the Off-Road has a different transfer case with Crawl Control, which is not present on the other models???This is completely UNACCEPTABLE in any new vehicle and I am hoping Toyota will address this soon. It sure takes the excitement of owning a new vehicle and throws it out the window. The truck is, overall, nice and fits my needs; however, I will not be able to keep it if the vibration can't be quelled. Trading it will lose me thousands of dollars.

From what I'm told the 2016 has a new engine in it, and it is not playing nice with the transmission. The vehicle is a bit jerky and seems to shift early, yielding a feeling of power loss and transmission misbehavior. It's hard to tell if it's an engine issue, a transmission issue, or if the new engine and existing transmission are not working well together. Either way it is extremely disappointing. Up until now I've had a T-100 for the last 16 years and, even with it's minor door, window and seat-belt issues, the engine has always ran very smooth.

When I'm parking in the garage it wants to lurch/surge occasionally. I'm modulating the brake because the truck just fits inside. (Trying not to go through the wall.)  The transmission feels indecisive and hesitant. It is very annoying when you take off from a stop then have to let off the gas when traffic slows ahead. When you get back on the gas the truck seems unresponsive for a couple seconds.

I have to back my truck from the garage and at this point it was really frustrating and worrisome. I once again went into reverse mode and this time pressed the accelerator a bit more. Truck lurched and engaged into reverse in a hurry. I had to press the brake hard in order to back off slowly since there is not much room in the side of truck with garage. I think it is a very dangerous situation just to press the accelerator so hard just to engage into reverse mode.

However, when you have your family in the truck, take that left turn at the light and just as you are halfway to being on that road you notice a vehicle attempting to keep you from turning so they have accelerated to 90 mph to get you to stop or scare you to death because they think the road is theirs and not yours. So you do the only thing left to do since you have too much of the truck on the road you are turning onto, you floor it. Now most people are used to an engine that, when you floor the gas pedal, it firmly plants the back of your head on the headrest you never use except in these moments. Now here is the problem.

I didn't think anything of it until I went online and notice thousands having the same issue. This is not just a one time thing or a chance occurance. There are several pending class action lawsuits against Toyota for defective wiring and engine components that are made of a soy based product that is a principal source of some rodents diet. This makes the engine components irresistible to rodents. Honda, Toyota and Ford have all been experiencing higher than normal issues with this since switching to this product. What makes this worse is that there is no solution to the problem. I cannot move or relocate because of the wildlife, squirrels are everywhere. Additionally, the dealership snickered with put some moth balls or make some homemade rodent repellant. Unfortunately whatever spray or toxic repellant you use around the engine, will eventually be breathed into the cabin which could become deadly. This also could affect drive that are in motion or could leave them stranded on the side of the road. Luckily for me, my car was parked and I was alerted by the check engine light and able to drive the vehicle to the dealership.

The buzzing vibration emanates through the steering wheel and gas pedal at a severity and pitch that causes discomfort, tingling in the hands, arms, and right legto an extent I become distracted when driving owing to the discomfort and use unsafe driving methods to avoid the steering wheel or gas pedal. when accelerating from 1,000 through 3,000 rpms, the steering wheel and gas pedal exhibit a resonant buzzing vibration. The vibration is powerful and worst in the 2,100-2,500 RPM range. Extreme cold weather temperatures (15 degrees or less) dampen it. the vibration only occurs when the engine is under load. It does not happen when the engine is revved through these ranges in park or neutral. when the vibration occurs in the 2,100-2,500 range, it happens at an intensity and frequency that causes clothes and shoes to vibrate. Moreover, one can feel the vibration in the skin and bones. when traveling for long distances on the highway through hills or mountains, the engine often settles in the 2,000-2,500 range. The vibration is constantly present in the steering wheel and gas pedal. After long exposures to this vibration via long trips, hands and feet begin to experience tingling. I constantly try to steer with minimal to no contact with the steering wheel and using cruise control to avoid the discomfort. This affects driver's ability to feel and maintain proper control of acceleration and steering. I find myself constantly trying to get out of this range when on long-distance highway travel.

169,accessories-interior,inaccurate_eco_fuel_economy_display,Paul,US,Apr 12,"Automatic transmission-5,000 miles","I'm a long-time Toyota fan and multiple vehicle owner. I'm writing because I'm disappointed with the inflated fuel economy that my new 2016 Toyota Tacoma Sport 4x4 is showing on the Eco display. At first I was extremely happy to see that according to the display I was getting 25-26 MPG. EPA ratings are 18/23. But then I measured it myself. Over the course of 4 tanks my actual was consistently between 20 and 21. This was not measured until about 4,000 miles and approaching 5,000 miles on the vehicle, so it wasn't just a first tank fluke. Having my Toyota reporting MPG that is inflated 20-30% over actual is disconcerting. Integrity, honesty and credible MPG calculations are important to me and what I expect of the Toyota brand quality. I am asking Toyota to please fix this --- for my vehicle -- and make sure that it is true and believable for all Toyota vehicles where it is reported.So far Toyota's response has been frustrating --- I have written emails, followed through on their requests to go in to the local dealer to have it checked out multiple times, and many phone calls.The local dealership's service department looked it over and did a reset of the computers mileage tracking and said maybe this would fix it -- and to use it and then check it again. I did this and am experiencing the same issue. It is still not working properly.Results are basically the same as before as I measure the miles per gallon (MPG):
18.535 gal 391.8 miles, 21.14 MPG
15.392 gal 320.1 miles, 20.80 MPG
Yet the trucks Eco display shows a reading for this similar time period of 25.2 MPG.I emailed Toyota and received a generic non-helpful email reply, so I called. Per Toyota's instructions I then went back in to a local dealer again -- this time for them to complete a Fuel Consumption Test they requested. They concluded:
Vehicle MPG does not drop when vehicle is not moving. Gauge only factors in fuel used while moving not while sitting still.""The vehicles MPG calculation is incorrect and very misleading. 
? The MPG calculation should be taking the total miles traveled divided by the number of gallons of gas used --- regardless of whether the vehicle is moving or not. 
? This is a very common standard and general practice calculation known and applied by many, including the car industry the U.S. government and general consumers.
? Per the U.S. governments fueleconomy.gov website (U.S. Dept. of Energy) on the page How to calculate Your MPG:
 Dividing the number of miles driven by the number of gallons it took to fill the tank. The result is the vehicle's MPG for that driving period.""
? My MPG is being inflated by this erroneous MPG calculationThis MPG calculation needs to be fixed on my vehicle, and on all Toyota vehicles where a similar calculation and reporting occurs. Among my concerns are:
? That I can no longer use this feature to reliably track my MPG or monitor my vehicles condition as I should be able to do
? When I bought my vehicle, I selected and paid for many features that I value so that I could benefit from them
? This error in the trucks MPG calculation is deceptive; it misleads me, and likely many others, to think that the Toyota Tacoma product is getting significantly better MPG than it really gets
? The value of my vehicle is significantly reduced due to this deceptive and misleading error, and more reduced to the extent that the product brand becomes associated with reduced quality, deception and/or being misleading
? This error takes away from the integrity, honesty and credibility I have come to expect as a fan of Toyota vehiclesToyota - Please fix this problem right away --- for my vehicle -- and make sure that it is true and believable for all Toyota vehicles where it is reported.I am feeling that I need this escalated to get it resolved as so far no one has been able to fix it. I have followed Toyotas instructions to help you diagnose and fix this error, yet it still persists.

This typically occurs on drives over 2-3 hours or heavy stop-go traffic.

Examples include downshifts from 5-6, 5-4, 4-3, and 3-2 as well as upshifts through those same gears. This presents a critical safety concern when the transmission malfunctions and the vehicle does not operate as intended. It places the driver in dangerous and potentially life threatening situations, whereby the driver is taking attention away from driving in order to apply significant pressure on the shift lever in order to get the transmission unstuck. Moreover, while maneuvering the vehicle through traffic or intersections, the driver and others on the road become vulnerable to major accidents caused by a malfunctioning Toyota transmission and the inability of the driver to safely operate the vehicle.

When driving through mountainous terrain at today's interstate speeds, there is recurring ""bumping"" that sets up when ascending long grades.

Traffic was moving at ~ 10 miles per hour due to road conditions and my wipers were on (medium speed if I recall correctly), traffic stopped suddenly and all of the snow from the top of the truck immediately slid forward and covered the windshield. At this point the wipers were essentially buried/ jammed due to the amount of snow and the windshield was completely covered while I was on the expressway. Had the conditions been slightly better I could have been doing well over 10 miles an hour and the result would have absolutely been a collision which could have involved many vehicles.

271,drivetrain,power_train,WI,USA,Sep 23,"13,451 miles","I live in a rural area with moderate hills and many winding roads and tree obscured corners. While driving at a moderate speed (30-40 mph), I experience problems with the vehicle's ability to downshift from overdrive to address the increasing incline. The vehicle will, despite normal increase in fuel pedal pressure, lose RPM's from approximately 2,000 to 1,000. As it approaches 1,000 RPM, the vehicle begins to ""stutter"" and ""lurch"" as the engine tries to cope with the higher gear. There are two ""fixes"" for this; pushing the gas pedal down firmly, which causes the vehicle to radically down shift and ""leap"" forward, or to drop the transmission lever to ""manual"" and manually change gears (without the ""leap"" seen in the first method). The end result of the non-manual approach is to cause the vehicle to accelerate radically in an environment of obscured corners and uphill driving. I believe this is a dangerous safety problem as the area is swarming with deer, bicyclists, pedestrians, etc. I have also had ""stuttering"" incidents when accelerating from low speed, to enter traffic, interstate, etc., although these have been intermittent in nature. I have noticed that the vehicle will also radically downshift going downhill without warning and seems to take a long time to up shift once it is on level ground - again an intermittent action. Fortunately no one has been ""tailgating"" me when this occurs (a common failing of drivers in this area). I have had the vehicle to the dealer twice for the failure to downshift for a hill and they tell me Chevrolet does not recognize a problem with the transmission, shifting, etc. A side note: This problem does not exist in cruise control, but use of cruise control on these back roads would not be advisable.-Warrens, WI, USA",Colorado,2016
272,drivetrain,power_train,Park,USA,Dec 07, miles,"Chevy said there are no fixes for the following complaints. Transmission is acceptable and smooth shifting under light loads. Under a need for downshifting for acceleration the down shifting is delayed or hesitates momentarily and then the truck jerks forward to a excessively lower gear & the upshifts to the gear it should have in the first place. The delay or lag in downshifting creates a very dangerous condition when needing instant power. There is much difficulty when merging into traffic when power is needed.. manipulating the manual shift can cover up this defect on some occasions when if you have time to plan for it. The transmission also shutters at low load many times resulting in no power until you downshift. Then this downshift is delayed and then becomes abrupt again. The shutter feels like the truck is going over small bumps in the road. The transmission shifting is certainly not correct and certainly results in unsafe situations. I should have test driven the truck under more conditions than I did and probably would not have purchased it. I hear that this problem can be fixed with an aftermarket computer update. Chevy probably dose not want to admit that in order to have the gas mileage ratings the transmission must bet this way.

292,fuel_system,fuel_propulsion_system,Valley,USA,Dec 26,"7,600 miles","This vehicle's erratic downshifting and upshifting of the automatic transmission causes abrupt changes in acceleration and deceleration that sets up sequences that force the driver to continually press down on, or let up, on the break and or accelerator to attempt to blend in with stop-and-go traffic. In very heavy traffic, present when entering or leaving large cities, the onset and continuance of this vehicle's performance worsens resulting in driver fatigue and extreme stress, brought on by the ever present necessity to be extra watchful and to maneuver to avoid hitting the vehicle in front, or being rear-ended. When driving through mountainous terrain at today's interstate speeds, there is recurring ""bumping"" that sets up when ascending long grades. It creates the feeling that either the transmission is attempting to downshift but then changes its mind, or the engine's RPM are about to increase but don't. this adds to fear of imminent failure and being left stranded. This behavior was present from the very first time the vehicle was driven. It's getting worse.this driver believes the unsafe operating performance of this vehicle as described above, is exacerbated by the combination of the small, 4 cylinder engine coupled to the 6 speed transmission, that requires the engine to rapidly downshift or upshift to provide the needed performance required in today's driving environments. Further, it is evident the software controlling the transmission's operating behavior was neither fully developed nor tested throughout its anticipated full operating range and as such creates a vehicle that is dangerous to operate on public roads attempts to have these issues addressed with the dealer resulted in being told..."" nothing can be done...the problems you are encountering are being are being experienced by many customers.

This is my second complaint about this vehicle's interior accessories/systems just a month or two after buying it, and otherwise I do love driving the truck and everything about its exterior and performance.
I know the manual says that the USB interfaces are only compatible with iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, iPod Nano, and doesn't specifically mention my old iPod Mini... but you wouldn't expect that the car would end up destroying the iPod!
The Mini actually worked fine for a few days, it played like there was no issue. I used the iPod's USB-to-wide connector cable that came with all Apple devices back then. So I left it plugged in the car to be used each time I took a long drive and automatically stay charged up. When the car is shut off the USB ports are powered down, I presume, so what harm can there be? And USB is a standard 5.0 supply.
Suddenly one morning I found that the iPod was totally dead, no life, wouldn't take a recharge even on a regular USB port or wall adapter. So I conclude that the car destroyed the battery completely or fried some circuit inside by overcharging.
There needs to be a warning in the manual of what will happen if you plug in the wrong iPod. Otherwise you only expect a device to not work with the car's USB port--you don't expect permanent damage! I hope that my car's USB port circuitry wasn't damaged as well.

313,AC_heater,AC_not_working_properly,Grande,USA,Oct 27,Automatic transmission-11 miles,"A/C turns on when fan turned on or turned up
I can't believe I'm the first person to complain about this. Since truck was new it showed this issue but dealer has not witnessed it on any other vehicle, nor can I show them the problem because it only appears the first time the truck is started after being off for several hours to a day.
When I turn on the fan from off to any setting, or turn it up from any setting, the AC comes on 99% of the time. Doesn't matter what the temperature knob is set to or how cold it is outside (and of course the AC is off to begin with).
Strange thing is that my car model has the lower option package for climate controls, i.e., no AUTO climate feature should exist (I don't have AUTO on any knobs), yet in one of the photos of the display I show clearly that the car is setting itself to AUTO mode sometimes when I start the engine. I can turn AUTO mode off by hitting the vent buttons, but cannot turn AUTO mode back on with any button so that makes me think this is a software bug. However, I don't believe that this AUTO condition is related to the AC problem since I've seen AC come on either way.
In short, AC should never come on in the model I have unless I specifically turn it on with the AC button. But it does! So I need to constantly be turning it off whenever I start the car in the morning if I turn on/up the fan.
I would love to hear from others who have this issue. I lodged a concern about it using the GM web site support chat, and as far as I can tell there is no acknowledgement of it being an issue from their end.

342,transmission,transmission_hesitates,Q.Old,US,Oct 13,Automatic transmission-50 miles,The transmissions on these trucks are programmed very very badly. They shift up really fast and try to hold 6th gear even when they really need to shift down to climb even a slight hill. It feels like a manual transmission in high gear when you floor it and it just shudders. I assume this is just to save on gas but it is absolutely undefined and completely embarsssing when you have passengers and your truck is shaking trying to get up a hill beciase it just won't shift down.I bought the trifecta performance Colorado advantage tune as someone else mentioned it on this site and while it did give the truck wayyyyyy more power and a better throttle response it still had horrible shift points especially when coming out of corners and accelerating. It shifts down too far so when you press the accelerator suddenly you jerk intil it upshifts. Basically just winds out the gears longer and won't shift into 6th until you are at interstate speed. Really just traded one extreme way of shifting for another.I gave up on the truck and I think GM gave up on that transmission as well because now they are putting 8 speeds in the 2017 models. Hopefully they are more refined and better programmed than the 6 speed.I traded the truck for a ram after only a month and half of owning it and took a loss. I have never been a mopar fan but after driving and considering a Silverado the ram was just smooth as silk.

352,transmission,not_shifting_properly,Grande,USA,Apr 10,"Automatic transmission-6,500 miles","I am adding my weight to this common complaint that I read here, that the 2016 Colorado does not downshift properly when more torque is required like going up (even small) hills. This is been happening also to me pretty much since I bought my pickup in the fall of 2015 but fortunately most of my driving is freeway so I'm not as affected as others are. Plus I'm learning to put the auto transmission more often into manual shift (or driver-assisted shift) mode which is the ""M"" position on the console. This way you have near instant control of the downshifting.Best is to put it in ""M"" when coming out of park or neutral; the problem I've found with switching to ""M"" mode during driving is that, contrary to how I would design it, this immediately causes the transmission to downshift, at least in my experience, and races the engine when you're not ready for it yet. I would prefer that switching to ""M"" keeps it in the same gear but simply enables the mode, and then the driver can use the thumb rocker switch to downshift/upshift from there.Basically I love the look and features of this pickup and the mileage on freeway but I've identified several things, including this transmission issue plus some accessory nuisances, that to me are all related to faulty programming of the CPU. For instance I'm the guy who's iPod mini got destroyed by the USB port (see other complaint), and my iPod touch is working fine but every now and then the audio system forgets it's plugged in to the USB when starting the engine and I have to unplug and replug it, and this does not always work. My point is this transmission issue could perhaps be fixed with a ""simple"" code upgrade which says to never let the RPM go below 1400 (or whatever) when the gas pedal is engaged. I, like many of you, are bewildered to see our engines lug around 1000 and we're stepping on the gas!Overly simple bottom line: GM could employ some better programmers and beta tester drivers before releasing their software to the factory floor.",Colorado LT 3.6L V6,2016

If you stomp on the accelerator it downshifts and jerks forward.I called the dealer at about 1,000 miles and told them about it. They said ""it will get better with time"" ---- NOT! I had them check it further at the first service visit and they all was normal -- NOT!! I then called Chevy customer service and they said a fix was being developed and they would confirm my call with an email --- NOT!!Based upon the large number of complaints reported online I certainly hope that Chevy has a fix planned. In the meantime driving this truck is a PITA!Update from May 4, 2016:I filed a formal complaint with the NHTSA and urge everyone else having the same problem to do so.  There dozens of people experiencing the same issue with the 2015 and 2016 Colorado/Canyon trucks.  This is what I filed with the NHTSA ---  ""The transmission does not downshift from a high gear (5 or 6) to a lower gear when slowing down from 45 mph to 20 mph (or lower). When the accelerator is depressed to accelerate the engine bucks, vibrates, and does not accelerate. The engine rpm drops to 1,000 rpm or lower. If the accelerator is quickly floored the transmission downshifts several gears lower and jerks forward. This condition happens primarily on secondary roads while driving along the road AND when pulling from one road into traffic on another road. The situation when pulling into traffic is dangerous because the truck does not accelerate as it should. This truck was purchased new and has 6,500 miles on it.

394,transmission,not_shifting_properly,S.Seal,USA,Sep 26,"Automatic transmission-5,788 miles","There's an issue with how the automatic transmission shifts gears and then loses the ability to accelerate (bogs down) in a couple of scenarios while driving.
Scenario #1: When going around a corner I'm noticing that on several occasions there's no acceleration coming out of the turn. The engine kind of bogs down as if the ignition has become retarded, or its as if the rpm's aren't high enough. 
Scenario #2: While getting onto the freeway if I accelerate to get into additional lanes, on a couple of occasions there's been no power. 
I've reported this to the GM Dealer and they indicate that the computer is learning the way I driver. My response is that they've created a bad profile and its shifting thru the gears to fast, and it needs to be fixed. 
Some additional tests I've performed.
1. At various times shift to manual. This will tell you which gear you are in. And I'm finding that the computer is getting to 4th gear as fast as it can. 
2. Switching on the Tow / Haul Mode actually activates a profile to keep the RPM's higher as if your towing. This actually works a little better for city driving and freeway traffic, but it doesn't solve the problem unless you like hi-revving your vehicle all over town.
3. Drive with transmission in Manual. Although this can be a work around to the issue reported, it requires that you perform all of the shifting. Which is a pain in the ass and not why I purchased the truck.
Don't get me wrong, I actually really am enjoying the Canyon and what it has to offer. I just had higher expectations for the drive train. I'm also disappointed in the responses from the dealer ship indicating that the truck is learning how I drive and there's nothing they can do, which includes they can't even tell you how to drive the truck to get the best response (so that's lame).
