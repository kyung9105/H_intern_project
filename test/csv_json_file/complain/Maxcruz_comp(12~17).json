The passenger pulled the shoulder strap out to pull around and buckle to the seat latch when the latch plate just slide right off of the belt. There was nothing securing the shoulder strap. It just came apart. I went to the dealership to have the problem checked out and fixed as I was certain it would be covered under the car's warranty. I was shocked to find out that I would have to pay a couple of hundred dollars to have the seat-belt fixed! how could the dealer\/manufacturer not be responsible for a seat-belt malfunction? I still have the seat-belt problem as I believe that Hyundai should fix it and not charge me. If this happened to me, then I feel that it probably has happened to other vehicle owners so I am trying to find out if this is a wider spread problem than just a fluke with me.-Kensington, MD, USA","1":"A passenger in the back seat went to put on her seatbelt and found that the shoulder harness just came apart making it completely unusable and unsafe. I went to the dealer, fitzgerald Hyundai and reported the problem, expecting them to fix it but I was told it was my problem and I would have to pay to have it fixed. I was shocked as I believed that a seat belt malfunction was a safety issue that any dealer would take immediate responsibility for. When I insisted that the I did absolutely nothing to cause the malfunction and the dealership should fix it I was told that they would have to check it out with a higher management level and would get back to me. I have had no follow up from fitzgerald. I followed up twice by email once using their own website form hoping that would get a response, but still nothing. I am now concerned that this issue with the seatbelt may be a problem with other Hyundai owners so I am reporting the problem. I do not use my back seat for passengers very often but nevertheless I feel a seatbelt malfunction is a safety concern of high priority and something that a dealer should take care of immediately and there should be no dispute!-Kensington, MD, USA","2":"TL- the contact owns a 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe. The contact stated that while driving approximately 35 mph and coming upon a red light, the contact attempted to stop the vehicle by applying the brakes. The contact indicated that while pressing the break pedal the vehicle initially slowed down but the vehicle would not stop causing the vehicle to crash into the rear of a second vehicle. No injuries were reported. A police report was taken at the scene. The contact also indicated that the airbags did not deploy during the crash. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired.

During interim 20 seconds, attempted to pull vehicle to left shoulder as I was driving in far left lane. I felt \"engine drop\" or a feeling whereas the car no longer felt powered, cue that the engine had went off. Power steering went manual along with other power assist devices like power steering. On dirt shoulder of freeway attempting with manual brakes and steering to bring vehicle off roadway. Vehicle restarted during maneuver. Still moving at safe speed attempted to merge back onto the freeway, having not yet decelerated enough yet to continue to pull over....clear and dry conditions in North la county. This vehicle however has always had \"overly responsive\" or \"very tight\" steering, for lack of better terminology. I leased the vehicle and did not fully realize, until some time passed, what this 'steering characteristic' would mean in the future, in an event requiring accurate and responsive steering combined with the ability to maintain control. The sudden engine power resuming, combined with, what this writer would describe as \"tight steering\" to begin with, made the vehicle roll. The vehicle, with what felt like a \"high center of gravity\" always felt like it would roll if one were to have to move quickly to avoid something in the road for example. I did not realize this feature during my test drive. Being a lessee I was obligated to keep the vehicle for 3 years. The vehicle rolled several times while crossing 3 lanes of an occupied northbound highway 14. A sudden jolt resulted in a fracture of L1 vertebrae. During roll, jack became undone from where it was factory mounted underneath lift up cover, and had never been removed. Flailing around in the vehicle now was this heavy scissor jack bouncing around in the vehicle compartment with me. I am glad to be alive.-Lancaster, CA, USA","5":"While stopped at a red light on an incline, vehicle did not move when gas pedal was pressed.

After pulling over and sitting for a while the car would go up to 30mph - 40mph: Over that and it would occur again. Per the dealer - drove it to them. On the way - this slow down occurred multiple times between 30-40mph, once while slowing \/ breaking - the car immediately accelerated (RPM over 2500) and I almost had a major accident. Dealer diagnosed it as a known issue related to tsb: 13 fl 002 (throttle body bore carbon fouling \/ P2106\/P2110 limphome mode \/ P0638 throttle actuator control range and that the break issue was due to excessive break booster air causing the throttle assembly to lock open. Dealer claimed issue was known but not seen often and never repeated. Had car all day to fix (finished: 07\/08). Asked dealer about other tsbs in the database and was told none of them applied or were applicable. 3) recent event: On 07\/08 after leaving the dealer, got 9 miles of driving when it occurred again after making a 25mph right turn and accelerating to 40mph [almost was read-ended by a truck]. dealer now closed for the evening.

At random, and when making a left onto a busy street, accelerating from a stop light, there is a hesitation and a very quick shut down when accelerating. It re-engages just in time to prevent a potential crash. I talked to the Hyundai mechanic about this. They test drove it, but since the problem is random, it would make sense that they weren't able to detect it during the test drive. The problem isn't major for now but all it takes is one event to make it so. I was relieved to see other complaints of the same problem on this website.-Sahuarita, AZ, USA","11":"The steering wheel makes a \"scraping\" noise when turned.

My wife and I own a second vehicle that is the exact same make and model and it does not make this sound. Since the steering column is critical to the safety of the vehicle -and includes the air bag components, etc., we are very concerned that this could cause premature detonation of the airbag and\/or some kind of steering failure. Hyundai refuses to fix the problem and we are concerned not just for our own safety but for the safety of all Hyundai owners driving with this problem.

My tire warning light came on two more times during the time period that proceeded the service. I filled my tire again with air the second time. Then the third time the tire was completely flat! I called roadside assistance the next morning and they sent someone to come and put the doughnut on the car. I then drove the car to charley's tire a local tire repair shop to see what was wrong with the tire. Sure enough there was a nail in my tire.

The treads on the other three tires are also at risk according the mechanic that replaced my tire at the tire shop. The crap condition of the roads on staten island is no help neither for condition was caused by a massive pothole the formed in a sewer manhole cover. Tires are a safety issue and they should be taken care of the first time by the mechanics at the dealership since most car owners bring their cars there to be maintained and fixed, not three times and $180 later by an independent mechanic.

The tire was suddenly flattened while I was driving in 65~75 mph, so it was a life threatening accident. I really didn't expect this to happen because I had an inspection in maguire a week before the accident occurred. At first, I thought that my tire got impaled by the nail; however, the inspector in maguire couldn't find any nail. Surprisingly, the tire wasn'\u017c\u017cT leaking anymore after it was refilled again. He and his co-worker tried it several times to make sure it wasn't leaking, and it sure wasn't leaking according to their several attempts. I asked maguire to take responsibility for this weird accident, but they said that the fault is to Hyundai not them, while Hyundai customer service told me that the responsibility is kumho tire's. therefore, I asked kumho to take responsibility for my accident and asked the money for the repairing cost of my car. They first claimed that the tire has no technical problem since there is no more air leaking, so they can't pay the repairment cost. Nonetheless, the tire was flattened, which is an unchangeable fact, so I asked once more to take responsibility of my accident. After several attempts, they finally agreed to inspect the tire and send two tires to me. I also agreed at first, but I figured that I can'\u017cT really trust them for an honest inspection.

It has already been six days in the service department and every time we call we get more excuses like we are waiting for parts from Panama City.

Frankly, I thought it was related to the sandals I was wearing. I thought I was occasionally stepping on the gas and the brake at the same time (I have very big feet -- size fifteen). The problem stopped when I switched shoes (which also corresponded to the end of summer). The problem came back intermittently this summer and is now repeatable. When I am going down a steep hill at speeds over about 20 mph, the engine RPM's increase when I step on the brake. It does that while in gear and while in neutral. Obviously, if the drive train is in gear, the engine \"fights against\" the brake; if the drive train is in neutral, the engine revs. If the engine is in neutral or is shifted into neutral after the acceleration starts, the engine races until I let off the brake. It has gone as high as 4-5 K RPM before I let off the brake. All that's required to get the car to return to normal idle is that I pump the brake (let off the brake all the way -- I can immediately re-apply the brake and the problem won't happen again).

I have been doing more highway driving and I am starting to get scared that this could be a real safety issue. The next time I brought this up to the dealer, May 2013, the service dealer check computer for codes but didn't find any. Now, when I brought in for maintenance in August 2013, same thing, mentioned it had died 2 times since May 2013, all in similar situations and randomly\/computer checked and no codes.. today, September 7, 2013. It just happened again and this time as I was making a right hand turn from a busy street (45 miles\/hr when it died- no power steering. Good thing I was able to come to a stop before crossing the median into oncoming traffic and no one was right behind me. I was able to restart the engine and drove very cautiously home! plan on bringing it in and leaving it with the dealer asap.-Elk Grove Village, IL, USA","47":"1) historical details \/ event: When I bought the car (August, 2012) I noticed the occasional sticking of the throttle and when pressing the break the car would seem to want to accelerate - this would happen once every three months: The dealer said they couldn't find anything. 2) recent event: On 07\/07 while driving at 45mph the car immediately started slowing down to less then 10mph and the check-engine-light came on. After pulling over and sitting for a while the car would go up to 30mph - 40mph: Over that and it would occur again. Per the dealer - drove it to them. On the way - this slow down occurred multiple times between 30-40mph, once while slowing \/ breaking - the car immediately accelerated (RPM over 2500) and I almost had a major accident. Dealer diagnosed it as a known issue related to tsb: 13 fl 002 (throttle body bore carbon fouling \/ P2106\/P2110 limphome mode \/ P0638 throttle actuator control range and that the break issue was due to excessive break booster air causing the throttle assembly to lock open. Dealer claimed issue was known but not seen often and never repeated. Had car all day to fix (finished: 07\/08). Asked dealer about other tsbs in the database and was told none of them applied or were applicable. 3) recent event: On 07\/08 after leaving the dealer, got 9 miles of driving when it occurred again after making a 25mph right turn and accelerating to 40mph [almost was read-ended by a truck]. dealer now closed for the evening. Will be contacting dealer first thing on 07\/09 and demanding fix and\/or replacement - as this is now multiple times with the dealer denying the severity of this.-Skokie, IL, USA","48":"2012 Hyundai Santa Fe had complete power loss on interstate while moving at 65mph in the left most lane. Engine shuttered, check engine light came on and engine power went to idle RPM. There was no throttle responce and steering became heavy. Managed to cross two lanes and get the vehicle to the shoulder. Shut vehicle off and restarted it. Check engine light stayed on and engine appeared to function normally. Accelerated from shoulder into traffic. Drove for 1\/4 mile and incident again repeated itself as described above. Fearing for my safety, I parked the vehicle and had it towed to dealer whom I purchased vehicle from. I called (on 5-2-13) the dealer and told them what was happening. The next morning (5-3-12) I called them at 9am to find status of repair. They stated it was already repaired. They stated it is related to the trottle position sensor. They stated they were well aware of the problem. They stated they were having many of the same issues with this type of vehilce. They stated there was a tsb on the problem.

I had my foot on the brake pedal and the pedal went to the floor! I turned my steering wheel to the left as far as I could, but I tapped the bumper of the vehicle in front of me. There were no injuries and very minor damage to the rear bumper of the vehicle in front of me, and very minor damage to my front bumper. No other vehicles were involved. I called the Hyundai dealership and told them that my brakes had failed and had caused an accident. I was told that it was probably not the brakes, but the master brake cylinder. I had the vehicle towed to the dealership (carl gregory Hyundai, at northlake, columbus, ga) this morning I called to check on the status of the vehicle and was told that they had driven the vehicle for 200 miles and could not reproduce the problem.

I then proceeded to pull into the vacant parking spot and when I applied the brakes, the vehicle sounded like it was actually gunning into a higher gear, and as I was pushing harder down on the brake with my right foot the vehicle jumped the sidewalk in front of the bakery. I proceeded to apply both my feet to the brakes in hopes that the vehicle would stop, and it did. Thankfully no one was injured and the vehicle stopped before entering the bakery window.

It was towed to the dealership where it has been for one month as Hyundai dragged their heels until I got angry and emailed them. Two days after I emailed them I got the following leaving me with the repairs as well as paying for the rental for a month. Thank you for your recent correspondence.

We were unable to find any malfunctions or defects that would have resulted in the condition you claim caused your accident.-Philadelphia, PA, USA","54":"After driving the vehicle for approximately 7500 miles I notice an unpleasant odor that smells like melted plastic. It's not the new car smell and at times it can make one nauseous. It is intensified when accelerated. August 2012 (purchased the vehicle June 2012) reported the smell to the Hyundai service department at sport durst. I was informed that possibly a \"plastic bag\" has gotten stuck on the bottom of the car and will burn off. December 2012, I once again informed them of this uncomfortable smell. I can not ride in the vehicle with the outside air coming in because I can smell the melted plastic no matter what state, city, or time of day the nauseating smell is there. The cabin air filter has been changed, the oil has been changed and the way I drive has been changed and even under very slow acceleration the smell is there. The vehicle was taken in June 2013 and still nothing has been done. I nor other passengers or other drivers should not have to smell this burnt smell.-Apex, NC, USA","55":"Hi, I am sending this paper due to the unexpected flattened tire accident on 81 I highway in May 26, 2013 2 pm. The tire was suddenly flattened while I was driving in 65~75 mph, so it was a life threatening accident. I really didn't expect this to happen because I had an inspection in maguire a week before the accident occurred. At first, I thought that my tire got impaled by the nail; however, the inspector in maguire couldn't find any nail. Surprisingly, the tire wasn'\u017c\u017cT leaking anymore after it was refilled again. He and his co-worker tried it several times to make sure it wasn't leaking, and it sure wasn't leaking according to their several attempts. I asked maguire to take responsibility for this weird accident, but they said that the fault is to Hyundai not them, while Hyundai customer service told me that the responsibility is kumho tire's. therefore, I asked kumho to take responsibility for my accident and asked the money for the repairing cost of my car. They first claimed that the tire has no technical problem since there is no more air leaking, so they can't pay the repairment cost. Nonetheless, the tire was flattened, which is an unchangeable fact, so I asked once more to take responsibility of my accident. After several attempts, they finally agreed to inspect the tire and send two tires to me. I also agreed at first, but I figured that I can'\u017cT really trust them for an honest inspection. I found similar \u017cflattened tire cases in the internet, so I decided to send it to nhsta for accurate and through inspection. Please help me and many other people who have similar cases to find a reason for a \"\u017c\u017cno hole, yet somehow flattened tire. Thank you. P.S I have inspection papers that I got before an accident and after the accident. I will attach these papers and send a tire if you need a close inspection.-Ithaca, NY, USA","56":"In stop and go traffic, I took my foot off the brake to coast towards the car in front of me.

Still moving at safe speed attempted to merge back onto the freeway, having not yet decelerated enough yet to continue to pull over....clear and dry conditions in North la county. This vehicle however has always had \"overly responsive\" or \"very tight\" steering, for lack of better terminology. I leased the vehicle and did not fully realize, until some time passed, what this 'steering characteristic' would mean in the future, in an event requiring accurate and responsive steering combined with the ability to maintain control. The sudden engine power resuming, combined with, what this writer would describe as \"tight steering\" to begin with, made the vehicle roll. The vehicle, with what felt like a \"high center of gravity\" always felt like it would roll if one were to have to move quickly to avoid something in the road for example. I did not realize this feature during my test drive. Being a lessee I was obligated to keep the vehicle for 3 years. The vehicle rolled several times while crossing 3 lanes of an occupied northbound highway 14. A sudden jolt resulted in a fracture of L1 vertebrae. During roll, jack became undone from where it was factory mounted underneath lift up cover, and had never been removed.

I proceeded to make a right turn and all power failed on vehicle. The radio display went dead and the car stopped mid turn. It was almost like when your power goes out at home during a storm. I tried shift the car to see if it would want to start back up but it didn't let the key go all the way to the right like you would to normally crank a vehicle. The panel illuminated all icons and lights (similar to a power outage). I tried to start the car a few more times when finally it turned over and I pulled to the nearest parking space.

After having the vehicle all day, I arrived there slightly before 5pm to discuss what was found. They proceeded to show me a print out of the computer reading where it had no \"codes\" present. I was then told if they don't have a code, they don't know where to look for the issue. I then explained that I was lucky this time that I was not in traffic or that another car wasn't behind me or that it wasn't at night in an unsafe area but as a car owner why am I expected to roll the dice with my safety?? why can't they do what it takes to get to the bottom of the issue. I don't like being at any dealership wasting my evening haggling with them more then they do. Therefore I have no reason to make it up. The service manager tried to explain that his hands were tied and that for the warranty to be used to check all potential issues (without any \"codes\") I would have to be responsible for the bill unless they find something which I feel is unfair when the car is 2 years old with 40,000 miles.

Power shut off, engine and battery light went on. Unable to put gear shift in park. After a minute was able to turn the engine off and then re-start car. Made a complaint to the dealership. A few months after it happened again. This time on the highway. Took it straight into the dealership. They kept it for a couple of days. Diagnosis a loose connection. Again same scenario a couple of months after. Was told they couldn't find anything wrong it. Again - a few months after same thing. This time the battery was changed. Again it happened. This past 2 weeks it has been occurring more often. Took it in and was told they upgraded the system. Exactly 5 days after while making a right turn on a one-way street, the power went off. I barely avoided an accident. By sheer force I was able to avoid running right into another vehicle which was park by steering the car into the opposite direction. What was most upsetting there was a child in the car with me. This is a lease vehicle and I can't get out of the contract.-Brooklyn, NY, USA","94":"Our 2012 Hyundai sante fe has suddenly lost power on three occasions. The first two times we were driving at highway speeds, lost power and managed to get to the side of the road without being hit from behind. The dealer initially did an ECM upgrade and after the second incident replaced the throttle body assembly. A year later (March 2014) the same thing happened while driving about 15 mph. Unlike the previous episodes, there was no code and the dealership couldn't replicate the problem. They told me to take the car but I refused because it was such a safety problem. After two weeks with the car they replaced the throttle body assembly again. I am concerned that this is going to happen again and tried to work with the dealer to replace the car but without luck. I've seen on the internet that this problem is common with this particular car and can't understand why there isn't a recall. Many people experienced the same scenario as I did and also believe the next time they could be killed.-Bloomington, MN, USA","95":"The vehicle shut itself off when driving locally and on high way. The dealership could not even make a diagnosis. Hyundai headquarters refused to investigate it.-Wynnewood, PA, USA","96":"This is my latest issue with my 2012 Santa Fe (the previous being a bad transfer case which made it sputter, a bad 4WD coupling assembly which made it clunk while turning & a bad transmission range shaft which caused it to not start occasionally)...it now just turns off while driving. Happened twice in the past few weeks. The first time, 2\/5\/14, I was turning across 2 lanes of cross traffic around 20 mph and it just turned off and drifted! at first I didn't even realize what happened... thank goodness I wasn't hit by oncoming traffic! on 2\/22\/14 it happened again as we were driving down a hill coming to a stop! fortunately the brakes still worked but again it just turned off with no warning... both times there was sufficient gas in the vehicle and it started right back up. It is going to the shop this week, but I really feel like I got a lemon of a vehicle! I owned 3 other Hyundai previously and never any problem and now it is constant!!! I don't want this vehicle as I do not feel safe in it at all but the dealership says that there's no way to get out of this lease!-Pittsburgh, PA, USA","97":"I was on a freeway on ramp that goes downhill and involves a curve to the right. About halfway down the on ramp my engine stalled. I had to turn my wheel as far right as I could to avoid going off embankment and could not accelerate to try to move away from the edge of the embankment or attain a safe speed to merge onto freeway. My oil light and malfunction light both came on. I was able to get to the side of the road and turn car off. When I turned it back on all indicator lights were off and car drove fine. I was informed by dealership there has been a recent software fix for this that has to do with the throttle.-Roseville, CA, USA","98":"Car has stalled while driving three times, all at low speeds. 3\/4 tank of gas, no less.

Accelerated from shoulder into traffic. Drove for 1\/4 mile and incident again repeated itself as described above. Fearing for my safety, I parked the vehicle and had it towed to dealer whom I purchased vehicle from. I called (on 5-2-13) the dealer and told them what was happening. The next morning (5-3-12) I called them at 9am to find status of repair. They stated it was already repaired. They stated it is related to the trottle position sensor. They stated they were well aware of the problem. They stated they were having many of the same issues with this type of vehilce. They stated there was a tsb on the problem.

The contact stated that while driving at 65 mph, the vehicle lost acceleration power and did not accelerate over 30 mph. The engine had to be shut off for the vehicle to regain acceleration. The dealer replaced the throttle body and the computer system was updated. Less than two weeks later, the failure recurred. The vehicle was returned to the dealer and the throttle body was again replaced and the contact was awaiting the results of more testing. The manufacturer was notified and advised her to take the vehicle to a different dealer. The vehicle had not been repaired.

This pattern had been going on for several miles. I was not touching the accelerator and in fact, my foot was not on the brake either, and the car suddenly accelerated full throttle. I had just a couple of seconds to try to avoid hitting the vehicle in front of me. I swerved to the right, towards the shoulder, but I hit the truck in front of me. I was braking the entire time, but it was not enough to stop the sudden unintended acceleration. My left bumper hit his truck on the right hand side of his bumper. My radiator was damaged and leaked all the fluid out onto the highway. The car was not drivable because of the radiator.-Hudson Oaks, TX, USA","103":"The car was parked on a sloping driveway. The keys were removed from the ignition and the car was shifted to park. A 2 year old child alone in the car managed to shift from park to neutral without the key being in the ignition or applying any brake pressure. The car then rolled down the driveway and into traffic. By sheer luck and adrenaline, I managed to run after the car, get the door open, dive in, and stop the car by depressing the brake pedal with my hand before an accident occurred. After this event, I was able to reproduce the shift-from-park-to-neutral-without-key-or-brake behavior 100% of the time. This is extremely dangerous.... my kid could have been hurt or worse.

I then proceeded to pull into the vacant parking spot and when I applied the brakes, the vehicle sounded like it was actually gunning into a higher gear, and as I was pushing harder down on the brake with my right foot the vehicle jumped the sidewalk in front of the bakery. I proceeded to apply both my feet to the brakes in hopes that the vehicle would stop, and it did. Thankfully no one was injured and the vehicle stopped before entering the bakery window. I called the dealership and arranged for them to tow it to their mechanics department.-Elma, NY, USA","105":"Driver was pulling into a parking space when Santa Fe suddenly surged or lunged forward and to the right causing car to jump over a concrete bumper and into another car parked at a 90-degree angle.

Dealer claimed the events could not be duplicated.-Montgomery, AL, USA","106":"My vehicle started to vibrate occasionally, I brought it in many, many times, it would not do it for them. So eventually it started to violently shake and they finally said oh maybe there is a problem! So to this point they made me feel like I was just crazy and it cost me days in wages because I would bring it down and they would keep it to \"look\" for the issue, I wouldn't drive it to meetings out of town. I didn't trust it.Eventually they said there was a clamp missing, one that held the axle together, but I was never in danger, they say!! I feel this is an important piece of the car and one someone should have noticed earlier, I was driving this for 12 months before they found it. I still do not trust the vehicle and dealership. I will never recommend Hyundai anything to anyone!!!!","107":"The staff was very helpful and efficient for this repair.","108":"When I bought the car in 2016.

The compressor sometimes has shut off completely during braking, and the A\/C control dial is still lit up like it is working fine. When using the MAX control turned on, the compressor shuts itself off when changing the output dial from dash output to floor and dash output and I have to turn it back on. This changes and morphs into all kinds of crazy actions, sometimes it works, sometimes it does this. I have had it in for repairs numerous times, over 6 times, and been told the control panel was replaced twice, and a new battery was installed after my car died the day after the dealership said part was ordered and that they checked everything out, but couldn't find any problem.So...Now my complaints have gone to Hyundai Customer Care\/ Hyundai America, and I met the field rep there at the dealership to hammer this out. So as of today, the second day, I have been notified that after test driving my car, the problem doesn't present itself. I have always suspected an electrical problem, and recently Hyundai release Campaign 929, fancy name for a recall, and it was to address problems with car stalling at low speed braking, which MY car has also done twice...but I think there is a bigger problem here. I think it is either the alternator is very poor, or electrical system isn't wired correctly. I am going to be without my car until they can figure it out, but honestly, I just want it fixed right.Other issues have been dome light assembly failure of front driver\/passenger dome lights, broken door clip on passenger door resulting in door panel coming loose, wrinkled armrests on both driver's side and passengers side also being replaced.","111":"while driving, when using the heater or ac ---you turn off the heater or ac ---a few minutes later it turns it self back on ---this can happen several times before it will remain off---this might seem small but it bugs me","112":"It goes on really high all by itself, I bring it in and it won't do it. I tell the dealership what it is doing, they say they have to see it first, but geez believe me, this is what it does. Not the first problem, it is going to take time to get them all on there.

Suddenly the gps screen went blank, except for the vehicle marker icon - this lasted for several minutes. It then flashed multiple directions for future turns (which were incorrect), it went blank again, and then reflashed other multiple directions for future terms. This happened several times. Ultimately, the gps said we had arrived at our destination, but we were at least 30 miles from one of the points along the way to where we were going.

They replaced the console top with a new one and it stopped for about 3 months and now it's doing it again. I'm taking it in next week, June 10, 2013. I think it's the latch. This thing isn't engineered well at all and it's a deal breaker for me as I don't spend this kind of money to have a noisy creaky interior. Every arm rest in any other car I've had doesn't make noise when you use it so why does this car's. The manager said he'd never heard of this but when I originally took it in before they replaced it the service guy said he's seen it before. Go figure! It's a bummer in that when it's new it's okay but then it makes noise when you lean on it.","116":"Losing the navigation system probably doesn't seem worth mentioning.

I had filled the gas tank and at the first stop sign I came to, the engine check light came on; and it died, powerless. I coasted to my destination (less than a block away) and called my service rep at danbury Hyundai (ct). She told me it was due to an incorrect gas cap replacement, to undo the gas cap and start the car. It worked. After the first episode, this absolute powering down of everything, brake, steering, control; happened so often, it became routine. Gas tank filling had no bearing-but it happened at stop lights or stop signs, so I was able to coast to the side of the road, put the car in park and restart it. All that confidence evaporated yesterday. I was due to get on the highway and drive about 45 minutes on a combination of highway and thruway to my daughter's. I was on a busy local road that passes through danbury when the car's engine light came on, without me being at a stop sign or red light, or even braking for any reason, and I lost all control of the vehicle. This happens so suddenly, I might add, that you have no time to even activate the emergency flashers, or do anything besides grab the wheel with both hands and try to get over as far to the right as possible to avoid being hit from behind. I narrowly escaped being rear ended by a dump trunk directly behind me. I put the car into park, started it up, and called my service dept. At Hyundai. I explained that this happened again, since I had originally told them when I had the car serviced in may of 2014, and they had told me then, that they couldn't duplicate it, so they couldn't fix it.

He said they could duplicate the problem only when they left footed braked and their solution was to not do that. I asked some more questions, basically why that would make a difference since we have always done it. He said since the Toyota problems the sensors in cars are more sensitive? I told him there are over 80 complaints with the ODI for same problem in 2012 Santa Fe - he said oh that is a different problem - I read all of them - trouble sounds the same to me. We researched this car before buying - nothing in their advertisements, paperwork or on the net said left footed braking will cause your car to stall - we would not have purchased it however, I am not even positive that is the problem. I did also open a complaint with Hyundai - they denied a claim of a lemon car and said to just to stop braking left footed.

Opening the garage door would have woke someone up. Also, the vehicles outside the garage were unlocked and untouched. After reading some complaints on here, I see there is an ongoing issue that may have been covered up by the dealership by cutting the wires. The location of the wires would have been extremely difficult to get to inside my garage. They also were cut and not chewed based on the pictures that were taken by the dealership for my insurance company.-Melbourne, FL, USA","141":"This is the third time this has happened but by far, the most significant. This incident occurred 9\/8\/13 - driving down nys interstate and was passing another vehicle when the car began to lose power. I was traveling at 70 mph and before I knew it was down to 35. I immediately pulled over onto the median, turned the car off and re-started it. (this is what I was told to do on 8\/19\/13 during the first incident). Prior to that, I put on my emergency flashers, waved my hand frantically out the window for the cars behind me to get over, as there was nothing I could do. After restarting my car I ultimately removed myself from the highway and took the back road home. Needless to say, I an quite anxious to get back on the highway and drive my vehicle. I called the dealership again and they told me to bring it in for a software upgrade. I asked if in fact they could just put in a new throttle actuator and they said it cost between $600-$1,000.

During interim 20 seconds, attempted to pull vehicle to left shoulder as I was driving in far left lane. I felt \"engine drop\" or a feeling whereas the car no longer felt powered, cue that the engine had went off. Power steering went manual along with other power assist devices like power steering. On dirt shoulder of freeway attempting with manual brakes and steering to bring vehicle off roadway. Vehicle restarted during maneuver. Still moving at safe speed attempted to merge back onto the freeway, having not yet decelerated enough yet to continue to pull over....clear and dry conditions in North la county. This vehicle however has always had \"overly responsive\" or \"very tight\" steering, for lack of better terminology. I leased the vehicle and did not fully realize, until some time passed, what this 'steering characteristic' would mean in the future, in an event requiring accurate and responsive steering combined with the ability to maintain control. The sudden engine power resuming, combined with, what this writer would describe as \"tight steering\" to begin with, made the vehicle roll. The vehicle, with what felt like a \"high center of gravity\" always felt like it would roll if one were to have to move quickly to avoid something in the road for example. I did not realize this feature during my test drive. Being a lessee I was obligated to keep the vehicle for 3 years. The vehicle rolled several times while crossing 3 lanes of an occupied northbound highway 14. A sudden jolt resulted in a fracture of L1 vertebrae. During roll, jack became undone from where it was factory mounted underneath lift up cover, and had never been removed. Flailing around in the vehicle now was this heavy scissor jack bouncing around in the vehicle compartment with me.

Taking to dealer for repair but told if they can't duplicate they can't do anything about it. I have only owned this car 4 months and want to get rid of it because I'm afraid to drive it now. Not sure if its a problem with the transmission or fuel system but something is definitely not right. Hope it happens for the dealer so it can be fixed.-Quakertown, PA, USA","150":"Driving down the street and without warning the car just died. I didn't know what was going on as no lights appeared but the steering was very difficult and I realized the car just stopped running for no reason. It was very alarming since I was in the middle of the road driving. Not stopped or turning. Luckily there were no cars behind me but had I been on a busier road or going at a higher speed, it could have been extremely dangerous and even more so for an inexperienced driver. I am very concerned about the safety of this car now.-Morrisville, NC, USA","151":"On two separate occasions, my 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe stalled, for no apparent reason, causing loss of steering, wheel control, and brakes. On the first occasion, I was driving through a mall parking lot. While making a left turn and attempting to drive down a row of parking spots, my car stalled and I was unable to turn the steering wheel, brake or guide the vehicle. On the second occasion, I was turning left down the street to my home. Again, without warning, the car stalled, various light eliminated on the dash, and I lost complete control of the vehicle. I had no advanced warning and the car otherwise seemed to be running normally.-Brea, CA, USA","152":"First time the incident happened I was driving about 20 mph, and as I made a left turn the car died completely. No control of steering and had to brake very hard to get the car to stop. Put it in park and car started right up again. Luckily no other cars were around me. It happened again about 1 month later after making a left turn again. Took the car to the Hyundai service dealer and he replaced the throttle body and cleaned all the grounds. The car ran great for about 6 months and about 3 months ago I was driving on a freeway off ramp going about 25 mph and the car completely died again. I put the car in neutral and turned ignition on and it started right up. One more incident occurred, 2 weeks ago, while slowing to a stop sign the car died again. I even changed to a higher grade gas. But I am still having the same problem. I feel unsafe and insecure driving this vehicle.

They have had it 4 times for the same trouble and until the last visit could not duplicate it - dealer in June 2014 kept car many days and then I received a call from service manager who asked if I braked left footed - well yes I do as my husband does. He said they could duplicate the problem only when they left footed braked and their solution was to not do that. I asked some more questions, basically why that would make a difference since we have always done it. He said since the Toyota problems the sensors in cars are more sensitive? I told him there are over 80 complaints with the ODI for same problem in 2012 Santa Fe - he said oh that is a different problem - I read all of them - trouble sounds the same to me. We researched this car before buying - nothing in their advertisements, paperwork or on the net said left footed braking will cause your car to stall - we would not have purchased it however, I am not even positive that is the problem. I did also open a complaint with Hyundai - they denied a claim of a lemon car and said to just to stop braking left footed. The letter said they drove it 200 miles with no duplication of trouble which is not what the service manager told me - they were able to duplicate it.

I proceeded to make a right turn and all power failed on vehicle. The radio display went dead and the car stopped mid turn. It was almost like when your power goes out at home during a storm. I tried shift the car to see if it would want to start back up but it didn't let the key go all the way to the right like you would to normally crank a vehicle. The panel illuminated all icons and lights (similar to a power outage). I tried to start the car a few more times when finally it turned over and I pulled to the nearest parking space. I immediately called the dealership and explain what happened. I had roadside tow it to the dealership (sport durst). After having the vehicle all day, I arrived there slightly before 5pm to discuss what was found. They proceeded to show me a print out of the computer reading where it had no \"codes\" present. I was then told if they don't have a code, they don't know where to look for the issue. I then explained that I was lucky this time that I was not in traffic or that another car wasn't behind me or that it wasn't at night in an unsafe area but as a car owner why am I expected to roll the dice with my safety?? why can't they do what it takes to get to the bottom of the issue. I don't like being at any dealership wasting my evening haggling with them more then they do. Therefore I have no reason to make it up. The service manager tried to explain that his hands were tied and that for the warranty to be used to check all potential issues (without any \"codes\") I would have to be responsible for the bill unless they find something which I feel is unfair when the car is 2 years old with 40,000 miles.

We started experiencing problems with the vehicle stalling while driving in 2013. The car stalled multiple times on city streets and once on the highway. When the car stalls, the driver loses power steering and brakes. It is a very dangerous situation. After the third time the car stalled we took it in for service in April of 2013 to the local Hyundai dealership. The technician ran a complete diagnostic and said he could not find anything wrong with the vehicle. We refused to take the car at that time and insisted on more testing. They did find a problem. They replaced\/repaired the etc-actuator and gasket-throttle body. The car ran fine until last week when it started the same problems again. It has stalled four times in the last week. The latest stall happened today when my girlfriend was driving the car at around 30 mph. It also stalled last night when I was driving it home at about 25 mph. I was able to get to the side of the road and put the car in park. I turned the key and it started right up again. When it stalled on me, I lost power steering and power brakes. The time of the incident was 9:48pm and the mileage on the car was 72,917. It was very scary. We are taking car to Hyundai dealership today for repairs. We do not want to drive this car anymore.

Within initial 10-minutes of driving, car bucked\/surged and engine light appears. Car would not accelerate in one instance. Pressing gas pedal had no effect. Could only coast to dealership maintaining whatever speed I had by having the car in drive and idling. Very unsafe to be unable to accelerate. Hyundai dealer 'fixed' problem by doing a software update. In no case would it seem plausible that the software is coded to disable the acceleration.

The first two times we were driving at highway speeds, lost power and managed to get to the side of the road without being hit from behind.

Unlike the previous episodes, there was no code and the dealership couldn't replicate the problem. They told me to take the car but I refused because it was such a safety problem. After two weeks with the car they replaced the throttle body assembly again. I am concerned that this is going to happen again and tried to work with the dealer to replace the car but without luck.

According to the Carfax the vehicle had been taken care of and well maintained for the most part by Hyundai Dealerships. On the 2-week mark of owning this piece of crap the engine blew. While on the Interstate and with NO warning whatsoever the engine started making a loud banging noise then shut down leaving us stranded on the side of the highway.The car was towed to my local Hyundai Dealership for diagnosis. They determined the engine was destroyed and metal fragments were found in the oil pan. The Service Manager then informed me that the 10-year 100k mile powertrain warranty that Hyundai is known for is only valid for the original owner of the vehicle. And the subsequent owner warranty is only given a 5-year 60k mile warranty. So my miles were within warranty, but conveniently for Hyundai the 5 year mark was over 4 months before I took ownership of the vehicle. So, after one month of owning this oversized piece of crap Hyundai, and two weeks since the engine blew up I am in a battle with Hyundai to stand behind their piece of crap Santa fe.Now here's the kicker: After much frustration going back and forth with Hyundai Customer Care (a joke all in itself) and my local Service Manager I decided to do some research to see if anyone else has had a similar issue. LOW AND BEHOLD, on the very day my engine blew Hyundai was forced to issue a recall on over a HALF MILLION Hyundai Santa fe and Sonata vehicles for possible engine failure due to a faulty engine manufacturing process that leaves metal fragments in the engine that will cause the engine to prematurely wear out. And of course, conveniently Hyundai says my engine is not part of that recall so they are doing NOTHING for me. any IDIOT can see that this is related.Engines today that are well maintained do NOT blow at 54k miles. The service manager as well as Hyundai need to stand behind their vehicle and make this right. DO NOT BUY HYUNDAI FOR YOUR OWN PIECE OF MIND!","169":"This is like the 5th or 6th time this has occurred. I come out, and my engine is dead. The alarm and horn won't work, and my stations have all been erased. The engine won't start initially. Most of the time, I can coax it to turn on. The engine sounds like it is going to die when I slow down to turn though. I've had it towed to the dealership once when it refused to start after a half hour. They acted surprised when I said there were engine\/electrical issues with my car. I barely drive. I work 5 miles from my home and average less than 3000 miles per year. My last car lasted me 14 years. This is unacceptable!","170":"While driving I heard a really loud knocking noise suddenly and then my engine just shut off. After having the vehicle towed to Hyundai, I was told that I needed an engine replacement. I am 15,000 miles out of warranty, but because of the recalls for the SAME engines in other cars, they tried to work with me. (just an aside, Hyundai extended the factory warranties to 120,000 miles in the Sonatas because of the issues, but not the Santa Fes). However, their deal was to split the cost of the replacement 50\/50 with me and told me that it would cost $9000 (totaling $4500 out of my pocket). After looking at pictures that were taken of the top end, which is extremely clean with no sludge build up or debris (yes, I get regular oil changes because I drive so much), I fail to see how it is possible for the lower end to have malfunctioned and be full of metal debris. Clearly this is a manufacturing issue that is the same as in the Sonatas. This is extremely dangerous. I am lucky I was able to pull to the side of the road without consequence. Hyundai needs to add ALL theta II 2.0 and 2.4 L engines to their recall list.","171":"Engine failure on a vehicle with less than 70k miles :(","172":"In April 2016, car died while I was driving on the freeway in a construction zone. After towing to an auto shop, diagnosis couldn't be found. Tried to get another diagnosis a few weeks later - failure could not be duplicated. Thereafter, engine started knocking loudly, still no diagnosis in ensuing months. Finally took it to Borman Hyundai in Las Cruces after calling to complain to Hyundai Customer Service. After 2 long trips to the shop in Las Cruces, they diagnosed metal shavings in the engine, and engine failure. Engine failed completely in December 2016, and car is not drivable. Hyundai will not replace engine (I am second owner, and out of warranty). I contend that this engine failure is identical or nearly identical to the problem for the Sonata built around the same time with the same engine - and Hyundai issued a recall for 470,000 of them. This type of engine failure is a hazard to both drivers and passengers and could result in serious injury or death. And Hyundai needs to replace this faulty engine whether is in warranty or not. If a manufacturer is willing to warrant an engine for 100,000 and ten years, the engine should not fail.","173":"tried to start it to go to lunch starter just clicked. took keys out and tried again started right up went to lunch it stared on way back pulled into work shut off engine lights go out tach drops to 0 still hear loud grinding noise try to restart nothing no clicks no starter engagement get out open hood sound coming from under engine. run into work to get wrench to disconnect battery took maybe a minute. got back to car noise stopped now smoke coming from engine compartment. got battery un hooked smoke stops got underneath it could not touch starter to hot, got it towed dealer called this afternoon said its not the starter the engine is seized and will need new engine anyone else had this happen???","174":"On Monday, Sept 19, 2016, while driving on the highway, my 2012 Hyundai, Santa Fe's engine suddenly made a loud noise and then stopped. No warning lights, just a very loud noise and then nothing.

I explored the internet and found that Hyundai recalled the Sonata engines because of engine failures. And then I found that my Santa Fe has the same engine as all of the Sonatas, so why not recall them, too?

I was stunned at her tone and when I tried to speak she interrupted constantly and just kept yelling you are not getting a new engine! I ended the call by telling her this call was going no where and I said good-bye. I want to know what happened to Hyundai's America's Best Warranty? I was told that this warranty went to the 1st owner? What? Why doesn't it follow the car? I am told that the connecting rod bearing failed in my engine and that may have destroyed the crankshaft and\/or other parts. I had nothing to do with this destruction of my engine.

They called me that afternoon and said no problem or engine codes were found . When I went to the dealer that afternoon I ask if they had driven my car and they said yes it ran fine. With that I left the service department to find the manager of the dealer to have him listen to my car, it was his day off. I took the car home that evening , car making even more noise, started the return trip to the dealer the next morning ,about 5 miles. I drove about 3 miles before it threw a rod. I called Hyundai's 800 # and the first thing they asked did my car shut off--I said no it blew up. My belief is the noise in the engine after in shut off was a valve and it broke and hit a piston.

The motor now needs to be replaced, the service department told us there are 3 motors ahead of me and won't be in for at least 3 weeks. We won't know if there is also a transmission problem until the new motor is in. I have the gold extended warranty and they will only approve a car for 5 days.

How come the Hyundai dealer didn't tell me about a engine recall when I took it in for service. Does any one knows if the newly installed engines will have the same issues or was there a fix? Hyundai you suck!!!","182":"Our Santa Fe starting stalling out while driving out of the blue. It's happened at least 10 times and seems to occur the most when coming to a stop. It's extremely dangerous to have this happen while driving and thankfully didn't cause any accidents. It started making a loud noise, we took it to our mechanic and now the engine is completely seized and needs to be replaced. I would never recommend this vehicle.","183":"Through local bank NCB, I leased my brand new Hyundai Santa Fe SUV on installment basis from Hyundai Al-Majdouie showroom in Al-Khobar KSA around October of 2012.After a couple of months (December 2012), I did experience the first engine stalling while decelerating towards a red traffic signal on my way to office (ZERO RPM, ZERO SPEED indications). I placed my SUV stick in PARK, re-started the engine and shifted to DRIVE and off I went.It did not happen again from that time on until middle of last year, so I simply ignored and did not report the incident to the car dealer.Around July of 2014, my family and I were in Qatar for holidays. The engine stalling incident re-occurred one time during decelerating towards a red traffic light. I placed my SUV stick in PARK, re-started the engine and shifted to DRIVE and off we proceeded with our trip.The latest engine stalling incident (third on my experience with my SUV) happened just last Thursday at around 4PM (20th August 2015) when I was approaching and decelerating towards a red traffic light on my way back to the office. The car did re-started after I placed my SUV stick in PARK, re-started the engine and shifted to DRIVE.This time, however, I am considering to lodge a formal complaint. It seems that I am not the only one suffering from this engine stalling issue which, although intermittent, makes my car unreliable and unsafe on the road, especially that I am driving with my family around the Kingdom on a daily basis, to\/from Bahrain on a weekly basis and at times to Qatar on annual basis, for the last 15 years (this 2012 Santa Fe is my third car).","184":"I have a 2012 Santa Fe that stalls on the freeway at speeds of 60-80mph. This has happened at least every couple of weeks since I bought this POS car back in March 2013. I've taken it in numerous times. Of course, they cannot replicate the error.Reading through other complaints, it looks like I'm not alone. In my case, it usually occurs when I'm merging onto the freeway at a high speed. All of a sudden, I'm not longer able to accelerate despite having my foot on the accelerator, my RPMs drop to ZERO and I decelerate rapidly. If I am able to safely pull over, I'm able to turn off and restart the engine and move along. The other day, this happened to me and as soon as I accelerated (after pulling off to restart my car once!), it happened AGAIN!This prompted my 4th or 5th visit to my dealer and I will not take this car home until they fix it. I actually have video of me driving on the freeway with NO RPMs and while keeping my foot pressed all the way down on the accelerator, got the car back up to 70 with ZERO RPMs. How the hell does that happen? Dealer thinks I'm nuts. I've contacted Hyundai now and received a case number, but haven't had anyone in their safety department call me back yet. Holding out hope.....","185":"I was driving down the street when my car just died. I noticed it was hard to turn the wheel and had no clue because no lights or indicators came on to alert me to the issue. Thankfully no one was directly behind me so I could stop the car and put it in park. It started back up and within a few weeks, the car is just dead now.I read several other complaints and it sounds like an ongoing issue and one that could be extremely dangerous.","186":"I really liked this car until it started to stall while driving. It happened 4 times and the dealer could not get it fixed.This created a very unsafe situation and I just wanted out. I would never sell the car privateer as it would have been unethical to do so. Hyundai headquarters was dreadful to deal with and would not take responsibility for making a defective car. Don't buy this car.","187":"This car is a lemon. It suddenly loses power at any speed between 40-80 miles per hour. Dealer has replaced the throttle body three times, supposedly they claim its a \"software\" update that's needed. It is a gas hog, worse than my v-8 Chevy Tahoe. It is totally unreliable.","188":"Today was the second time that my engine stopped while I was driving. Last happened 7 months ago. Fortunately I was only driving both times around 25 miles and hour and was able to pull over. Put car in park and it started again.Having read that this seems to be a chronic problem with this car, but doesn't seem like anyone has been able to find out what the fix is.","189":"While driving at a normal speed the engine just died. Imagine having cars behind you while this happens! When we called the dealer to report this issue and book a service appointment, the service agent asked if we drove a Santa Fe! Obviously they know of the problem. Will see tomorrow morning what happens.Stay tuned...","190":"While driving at a normal speed the engine just died.

Will see if this helps...","191":"Car stalled while going downhill and making a slow left hand turn. Been to the dealer twice with this issue but nothing shows up on their codes. Throttle body was replaced on the car before we bought it so that doesn't appear to be a solution in our case.","192":"As I am driving my car the engine suddenly stops without warning. There is no indication that anything is wrong, no sudden sounds or vibration, and no warning lights on the dashboard. This problem has occurred 3 times within six weeks. The first time I didn't give the problem much thought, the second time it happened I brought my car in for service. The service technician ran a full diagnostic check on the car but could not determine the problem. I was advised to call them the next time that the problem reoccurred and give them exact details of the incident. If possible they wanted me to leave the car in gear so that they could gather more data.On 11\/18\/13 the engine dies again (but restarts easily) back to the dealer, more tests, and still no answers. I am very disgusted and do not feel safe driving in my car much less putting anyone else at risk. Has anyone had a similar problem that has been resolved???","193":"Car will stall occasionally. Engine does not die, but you try to accelerate and nothing happens. Happens once every 3-4 weeks. Engine light does not come on. Engine rpm does not increase. Release accelerator and push again, car will then go. NEVER pull out in front of someone as you never know when this will occur. Is very dangerous issue. Under warranty, but useless. Dealer says can not replicate (that's a shock-it only happens once every few weeks) and computer shows nothing so they won't do anything.","194":"The car has simply died in the middle of the road, 2 times. 1st time (26k miles) on a 2 lane highway with a lot of traffic going about 40mph coasting on a slight downhill. Fortunately, I was able to pull to the side without incident, despite loss of steering and power brakes. Second time, (51k miles) slowing down to turn into my driveway. stalled during my turn, losing the steering I missed hitting my mailbox by inches.Both times I took into Hyundai service & they could not replicate the problem. The 1st time, they replaced wires that were connected to battery? I don't know why, it is not a starting problem. Any suggestions?","195":"The engine stalls at least weekly. Many times of dropping off the vehicle to the dealership, with no answer at all. The dealership and the Hyundai USA is kicking this back and forth each other.","196":"This is dangerous because the car just stops working dead in its tracks without any indication that there is a problem. One is not safe.","197":"This is a dangerous problem. This is the first time I am reporting this online, but have talked to the dealer service department 2 times before today's incidence. Bought this new at the end of April 2012. It died when slowing down - coming to a stop sign twice that first summer. Didn't think too much of it, but unusual. Next it happen in Sept 2012 while making a turn on a residential street.These two type of issues have happened a total of 6 times since I purchased it. Today, takes the cake - as I was turning from one busy street (approx 40 mi\/hr) slowing down and into another busy street approx 30 mph when it died. I lost power steering and almost turned into oncoming traffic. Hyundai service, looks at the computer and says it does not record anything and I should leave it next time to see if they can duplicate it.","198":"Mentioned this to a few people who said this is a safety issue and needs to be addressed. So this time I mentioned to the service manager. They checked computer for codes and nothing shows. Told me to keep an eye on it, if it started to happen more frequently. Maybe a code would show up.","199":"Just want to relate that at 6am on my way to work, my car died after I stopped at a stop sign. All was dead, except for three light on the dash. I was in drive when it happened and I immediately put the car into park, tried to start it and nothing happened. Tried three times and nothing happened. No noise - nothing. then when I was about to panic, it started. I reported it to the dealership as this is a lease car. Probably they won't find any problem. I took it to a reptable mechanic that said nothing will show on the computer when I do take it in because nothing registered when I tried to start it. He said it wasn't the gas and was probably electric. I just hope it doesn't happen again. I'm already upset about the creaky console that they've already replaced once. It still creaks and this will be the deal breaker for me keeping the car. Otherwise it's an okay car.","200":"Going on side street at 25mph when car suddenly lost control then hit a car tire on the right of the vehicle but then rolled over on its head. Side air bags deployed but not drive air bag. This car has to be unstable to hit another car on the side (see pics) and overturn. Besides, there are already recalls on some Santa Fe sport for cracked axles and bad tires......updated 12\/03\/15-Taylorsville, UT, USA","201":"I was driving West on U.S. hwy 80 at about 30 mph, after pulling out of a parking lot about 1 block before I lost control of my 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe, at an intersection. It made a sharp right turn without my help at all. After hitting another vehicle and then jumping a large curb, I came to stop about 18\" from a small tree. I was completely traumatized. The right front wheel had a blow out from the outside side wall of the tire. The mechanic said it looked slashed. The big question is, did the blow out occur at the time my vehicle made the sharp right turn at the intersection, or did it occur when it hit the curb? I don't know, but I feel something happened to cause that sharp right turn in the first place. I had the mechanic check out the right front wheel area (axle, etc). They said they couldn't find anything wrong with the vehicles parts, that wasn't caused by the accident. This makes me more convinced it has to be the tire. This is the second tire that has blown out on the outside wall of the tire since I purchased this vehicle in 2013. The other blow out was from a nail going through the outside wall. I only have 11,045 miles on this vehicle. Tires are a kumho, crugen, P235\/55R19, 101H sl BSW oe (information copied from a discount tire receipt when the first blow out was replaced 5-22-15). I am afraid to get back in this vehicle because I don't know what caused complete loss of control. I will trade it in on a different vehicle. I'm afraid of Hyundai's and kumho tires!-Longview, TX, USA","202":"I was heading home around 9 pm last night and only a few blocks from home when I heard a loud \"pop\" that sounded like a gun shot. I looked around and didn't see anything out of the ordinary but a few seconds later I started to hear tiny pieces of glass falling down on my sunshade under the panoramic sunroof on my 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe sport. When I got home, I saw that the front half of my sunroof had spontaneously exploded. Luckily, the sunroof and shade were closed when it happened, and I wasn't hurt, but it scared me to think it could have happened when the roof was open or while driving on the freeway! when I took my car into the dealership today, they said the roof had not been recalled and it was not covered under warranty. I had to open a claim with my insurance to start the repair. This is a huge defect and safety issue and Hyundai needs to take responsibility for the problem and cover the cost of repairs and my rental car. Ordering the parts and having them shipped from overseas and the repairs are estimated to take at least a week, if not two. Simple research on the internet has lead me to many other complaints of exploding sunroofs on Hyundai's and other vehicles manufactured at the same plants such as Kia and Ford, as well as numerous photos of vehicles with identical damage. Hyundai has acknowledged the problem, yet my local Hyundai dealership will not recognize it as a recall.-Portland, OR, USA","203":"You have to constantly fight the steering to keep the car from swaying to the left or right.-Gulfport, MS, USA","204":"I just got off the highway and coming into town approaching a four way stop. I stopped and when I started to go the car made a horrible loud noise and would not go forward. I made it half way through the intersection and it completely died. The car wouldn't go forward or backward. I called roadside assistance and they picked up my car and took it to the dealer ship and the dealership called me the next day and told me I had a broken axle that they would have to replace. I bought the 2013 Santa Fe in September and this happened on March 2013 only about 6 months old.-Clinton, IA, USA","205":"While turn left into a subdivision the steering would not re-center thus the car ran over a couple of large stones lining the roadway at the entrance. The ABS did not engage. Finally the car stopped about 30 feet later. I was able to finally steer the car back on to the street. There is damage to the undercarriage, the inner wheel well on the right side was torn off, the left front air dam, the exhaust system, the right front wheel was damage, and a flat tire.-Baton Rouge, LA, USA","206":"As I was traveling East on a main road, I turned left on to a secondary road at a very low rate of speed. I was completely shocked by the impact of my vehicle with a vehicle that was in the opposite lane, headed in a southerly direction. Prior to the collision I had no awareness of the presence of a vehicle stopped in that location, as the vehicle was completely obliterated from my view by the left side view mirror. I believe that the exaggerated size of the mirror, and the location of its position made it impossible for me to have a clear, unobstructed view in that situation. I feel the design\/placement of the mirror was definitely a contributing factor in this accident.-Macomb, MI, USA","207":"While driving my AWD santa-fe through snow. Snow begins to build up on tires and rims as due all vehicles. While having parked my santa-fe for 30-45 minutes or continually driving through snow and returning to drive said santa-fe you start to feel vibrations and then vehicle starts violently shuttering the faster U go. The snow throws off the wheel balance and makes car shutter violently. The only fix from dealer is park car in warm garage while parking or scrap inner wheels before driving. You would think any cuv\/SUV with AWD should not have this problem, really any vehicle should not have this problem. I guess I bought the AWD to stay on clean dry roads. Defeats the purpose of an AWD. Guess it will take someone crashing before looked into.

When I attempted to fill up the gas tank for the first time, the gas pump continuously shut off automatically as if the tank was full. It took approximately 15-20 minutes to fill up 3\/4 of the tank. I initially thought it was the gas pump that was bad. About a week later, when I attempted to fill up again, the same problem occurred on a different pump. I tried a couple of different gas stations, and the problem continued. I took the vehicle in to a Hyundai dealership for a check up. After a preliminary check, the dealer advised that there was no error code. However, in order for them to remove the tank and check the entire assembly, the gas tank was too full, so I needed to drive it around and use up some gas until it was less than 1\/2 tank full. So after a few days, I took it in again. After a few days, they advised that the after removing the tank, they observed the fuel tank neck end had been melted. They were not sure what the cause was. So they replaced the fuel tank, and filled the gas tank without any issues. We just got the car back, so we'll see it the problem has been fixed, or if it'll be a recurring problem. We thought it was very odd that a brand new car would have this problem, and we're more concerned what caused it to \"melt\". if there is a major heat issue that would cause something to melt near the gas tank, this is a very serious concern. The dealer advised us that an engineer from Hyundai came out to inspect it upon learning about the problem. We've found numerous similar complaint online, and not only with the Santa Fe but with many other Hyundai models.

They said they couldn't find anything wrong with the vehicles parts, that wasn't caused by the accident. This makes me more convinced it has to be the tire.

The reason they gave me was \"some loose screws\".The problem still persisted, again went to the dealer, they said they fixed it, but in reality nothing was done.

The dealer said they found sludge in the engine. Hyundai never asked for any receipts for oil changes, and just denied the claim. I then called the 800 customer service number, to be told that there was nothing they could do, all complaints were handled through the Better Business Bureau. I asked to speak with whomever denied the claim and they refused. So now I have a complaint into the BBB, but Hyundai has not responded. I don't understand how they advertise the best warranty and then deny all claims.I have researched the internet and found many people has had the same thing happen to them. How is this legal? Our vehicle is leased, so they know we have to fix it before the end of the lease. This seems like a scam, since we have to fix it. We also found at least 5 other Hyundai owners who reported the exact same symptoms as ours on the same make, all of which were denied by Hyundai. I will never buy another Hyundai, they are criminals running a huge scam. Don't believe the salesman, when they tell you they have the best warranty. They don't honor it. Dealer told me there is nothing they can do to help, they said, that they have seen sludge in the engine in other Hyundai's and ours was not that out of the ordinary.

The vehicle was towed to the dealership and they advised that they were going to put it in as a warranty claim with Hyundai because they had another one, same year make and model, come in the week before with the same thing. After googling it, I have read several incidents where this has taken place. I would like to see a recall on this due to the safety concerns that it poses.

After many discussions with Hyundai and going to 2 different deals, they have said that it is a defect and that all or most Hyundai's have this defect. I feel that it is a safety issue since when it is raining hard, the wiper splashes back onto the window due to the fact that the wiper is not hitting the entire window properly. I feel this is a safety issue and since most of the Hyundai's have this problem, it is a defect that the manufacturer knows about, but does not want to take care of.-Verona, NJ, USA","315":"While driving over a bridge - the sunroof part of my moon roof exploded.

So the next morning I made an insurance claim and had it replaced by safelite. Now this past week we had snow again in nyc and I was getting ready to leave for work and remote started the car.... guess what I saw when I got to the car! a crack from the base! so I started researching it and the turbo models have a heating element on the bottom part of the windshield for the wipers to defrost them. Now it sounds like a good idea but not if there's snow on the windshield which is cold and from the other side your heating it up inconsistently only at the bottom. Your just asking for a crack.

It sounded like a shotgun went off inside the vehicle. Fortunately, the inside roof cover was closed, so most of the shattered glass was sent onto the roadway, instead of inside the vehicle. Internet investigation revealed that this is not an isolated incident. Exploding sunroofs on Hyundai vehicles, including the Santa Fe and veloster, have occurred in the past. To me, this is a serious safety issue. Not only because glass could be blown with significant force throughout the vehicle, but because if it happened at highway speed, it might make it impossible to control the vehicle due to shock of the explosion and glass being shot everywhere. Since this is a recurring problem with Hyundai, there needs to be a permanent fix applied to any vehicle that has experienced this sunroof problem when it is repaired. To simply replace the broken sunroof with an identically flawed sunroof does nothing to ensure the safety of the vehicle during subsequent road driving.

When I got out of the vehicle I found that the sunroof had exploded and that the edges of the roof were pointing straight up. The sunroof was closed at the time of the explosion and the temperature was about 70 degrees. There were rain clouds moving in and I do not have a garage, so I went right to the dealership.

It seemed to have exploded outward but there was no evidence of what caused the explosion. Small shards of glass from around the edge of the gaping hole began to fall into the car, though the majority of the glass had flown out because I was going 65mph. I pulled over, patched the sunroof with duct tape and trash bags and continued to drive home. I will take the car to the dealership tomorrow to get it fixed.

I wanted to get something reliable, safe, good gas mileage, and a great warranty.Saturday, September 2, 2015, I took my daughter to the mall. After an evening of shopping, we got back to the SUV. The key fob \/ proximity sensor didn't work. I brought her stroller closer and closer to the car to make sure that I was \"within range\" for the sensor to work. I checked my purse and realized that it must have \"fallen off\" or \"detached\" at some point during the day. There was no warning. The key portion was attached to my key ring along with my TrackR device (should something happen to my keys, I would be able to locate them). However, since the black part of the key fob fell off and isn't attached to the key ring, there wasn't any way to find it.I spent another 2 hours re-walking \/ re-tracing my steps in hopes of finding the black electronics portion of the key fob. I left my name and number at numerous stores in hopes that they would find it.In the end, no luck. I was stranded with my two year old child.Thankfully my husband was at home and was able to bring the spare set of keys to us. If we would have been traveling out of state, we would have been stranded.He went online to see if this was a common problem. To his surprise, there were numerous complaints. However, our Hyundai Dealership stated that they were \"unaware of this problem\" and were not able to find complaints about it.Now my car that was supposed to be purchased to keep my family safe and secure makes me stressed out and nervous. I am constantly checking my keys to make sure that the black electronics portion of the key fob is still attached. There needs to be some type of re-call or fix for drivers who have these key fobs.Another big concern is that this SUV is the primary vehicle for us when we drive long distances to visit family and vacation. We took our SUV to Florida last year. Now I'm concerned that if I would be out of town and this would happen, I would be stranded. This could be a life or death situation should I lose the key electronics at an inopportune time.The key fob needs to have a better \/ more secure way to hold the electronics portion of the key fob on the key. Jeep keys seem to be better designed with a \"slide\" technique to detach the electronics portion from the key.","331":"Door lock mechanism has acted squirrely for a couple of years, but last week it finally went totally bonkers.

The AWD light came on along with another light pertaining to the drivetrain\/axle. We were able to continue a few hundred yards until a safe spot to pull over was found. The roadside assist tech suspected there may be water in the fuel system, however when loading the car onto the truck, noticed the jerking motion and insisted it should be brought in for inspection. In our first conversation with the mechanic he mentioned recalls on the vehicle.

Several weeks ago around 8\/22\/14), when I tried to rapidly accelerate on to the interstate from the on ramp, the engine revved up to 8-9K RPM but it felt like the clutch\/transmission never engaged and I could not accelerate.

This continued to happen several times over the next week. I took the car in for service and was able to demonstrate the problem to the mechanic. I was initially told it was the high resistance fuel pump which was replaced but as soon as I left the dealership and tested the car, the same issue happened. I brought the car back and a week later, they've told me it is the low-resistance fuel pump and fuel line. I am very concerned that they keep replacing parts without any improvement in the vehicle.

I told him it happens when turning at lights or stop signs...he was driving straight. On our test drive together, he definitely felt what I was talking about, asked his shop foreman to get in vehicle with us, he felt the condition as well, but said he did not know what it could be.

My mom opened a case number with huyndai at that time. I have just called to schedule the repair and they still do not have a part. They say it is a national back order. My complaint is how can something that is recalled with a significant safety issue associated with it, be allowed to continue with no replacement part for 8+ months\" this is not a window that will not roll down. Based on the information I can find there are 20,000 vehicles that have this issue and in 8 months they can't seem to supply adequate replacement parts. While the recall has not indicated any deaths, I am concerned because of how the issue is explained. It occurs suddenly, and the driver will lose ability to steer. My mother is not someone, who while driving on the highway will be able to control this car if this occurs. I would be happy if this would just get taken care of but the service manager at red hoagland and the case worker at Hyundai just say sorry but there is nothing they can do. At this point my mom doesn't feel like she can drive the car any distance for fear that this issue will arise.

It sounds like a single clunk with slight feedback in the steering wheel, when turning the steering wheel, and I have recently discovered that right front axle can be moved side to side by hand with wheels on the ground which also produces knocking sound. Car taken to two different dealership on three separate occasions, but each time unable to locate the source of the problem even after duplicating the knocking for technicians. Vehicle looked over each time with front suspension and steering found to be in good condition with no apparent damage, and tightening both front axle bolts, but the knocking still persists. Dealership advisors and mechanics are always very helpful, and assured me that vehicle is safe to drive and axle side to side movement is normal, but since knocking is becoming very apparent even when cornering on level roads, I am very concerned about vehicle safety. I have driven number of different vehicles and have never experienced issue like this, which makes me feel uneasy when driving the vehicle in fear that something may go terribly wrong, and at this point I am simply not sure which action to take.-Oceanside, CA, USA","341":"Car seemed to buck while driving in low gear.

They said the loaner car would be faster.

We purchased a Santa Fe sport at the end of November 2012. On January 2, 2013 with only 1018 miles on vehicle, our Santa Fe experienced essentially the same problem as described in the referenced article. A loud noise occurred (as if running over an obstacle), the engine lost all power and died. Upon restart, the vehicle would not move either forward or backward in reverse. After setting awhile, we were able to very slowly drive the car about 500 to 1000 feet to the dealership. Ruddell dealership was unable to repeat the experience. I now do not trust the vehicle and want it thoroughly inspected to determine if it too has a cracked axle as noted in the newspaper article. We have a road trip planned in early August and do not want to drive this car until it is thoroughly inspected. I took the car to ruddell auto on July 10 and showed them the associated press article but they did not offer to do anything about it. Ruddell said they would have to wait until Hyundai issued a campaign or recall but that is not satisfactory or acceptable. The car now has about 7400 miles on it. The dealership from which we bought the car is ruddell auto in port angeles, Washington 98362, usa. Please contact me and inform me what Hyundai intends to do regarding this serious issue. If I do not receive an acceptable reply from Hyundai, then I, too, will report it to NHTSA.-Port Angeles, WA, USA","348":"I was coming off the highway on the off-ramp and coming to a stop at a stoplight. When the light turned green, the car wouldn't not accelerate pass 10 or 15 mph. It seemed like it wouldn't shift to a higher gear but would be stuck on 1st gear to accelerate. I had to pull off the side of the road and get it towed back to the dealership. Before getting a tow truck, I attempted to turn it off and on several time. The check engine light would come on and any attempts to restart and accelerate the car would produce the same results; the car wouldn't accelerate. Also, after turning off the car, the car would not come on without a lot of engine cranks. The car only as 823 miles on it. I've only had it for 2 weeks. Extremely disappointed with the car and the company. Will try to return it. Not worth the risk of it causing inuring to my family.-Parker, CO, USA","349":"Sitting at a red light. Light turned green and I put my foot on the gas. Car made a loud clunking noise and wouldn't move. 2 policemen pushed us out of the traffic and called aaa. We were towed to the local Hyundai dealer (where car was purchased). Car was in the shop for 22 days. It was determined that there was a crack in the right front axle. Not the end of the problem........the dealer had a hard time getting the replacement part. Finally located one in so. Calif. And had it shipped 400 miles to carson city, nv. Part was removed from another 2013 Santa Fe. According to Hyundai, there are potentially 50,000 vehicles that could be affected by this problem.

After restarted SUV had full working power with drive and reverse5X. Vehicle is now at dealer for inspection for damage\/(safety).-Vero Beach, FL, USA","351":"What I am about to describe happens randomly. The only discernible pattern is that it happens when accelerating from rest or from slow speed. It has happened about 15 times in the first 800 miles of driving. When I begin to accelerate slowly forward from rest or from a slow forward roll there is no response. It feels like the engine has stalled, but hasn't. continuing to push down brings no result. After approximately a 2 to 5 second delay, the rpms begin to build up rapidly. The first two or three times it happened I suddenly surged forward in a very dangerous manner. The real problem, however, is that with following traffic expecting me to accelerate and continue to accelerate and I suddenly stop accelerating without having applied brakes, thus activating brake lights, there is a rear end collision waiting to happen. Here is an example from last night. I was rolling slowly in a left turn lane, foot off the gas, waiting for oncoming traffic to clear. It did and I begin the turn simultaneously pressing down on the pedal--no response. Let up and pressed down again--no response. I let up again, rpms came up, I pressed down again and proceed normally into a parking lot. I was perpendicular to 3 lanes of oncoming traffic and dead in the water for maybe 3 to 5 seconds. Essentially the same thing has happened while accelerating out of a U turn and also coming out of a slow right turn. It happened while accelerating slowly through an opening security gate. I have left the car with the dealer overnight so they could drive it and hook it up to their error code machines. They could not observe the issue or diagnose the problem. Nonetheless, it is real and very dangerous. It has been a matter of pure luck that no one has been close behind me during any of these power losses. I hope this report is useful.

To me, this is a serious safety issue. Not only because glass could be blown with significant force throughout the vehicle, but because if it happened at highway speed, it might make it impossible to control the vehicle due to shock of the explosion and glass being shot everywhere. Since this is a recurring problem with Hyundai, there needs to be a permanent fix applied to any vehicle that has experienced this sunroof problem when it is repaired.

Against my better judgment I still purchased this vehicle. The sales person informed me that the reasons why the vehicle performed the way it did was because it was a very windy. To this date the vehicle still sways left to right when driving over 55 mph and the cabin noise is driving me crazy. This is a serious safety issue that Hyundai will need to fix quickly. When speaking with the shop manager he made it sound liked no one else was having these problems, maybe they need to read the complaints on this site.

I just thought that some object like small stones hit the area and caused slight peel off. But, the peeling area spread because paining cracked around previous peel off area which lead to attached status. I don't usually wash my vehicle since there's enough rain in Alabama. I had been to Hyundai dealer where I bought my car. I didn't know the exact terms of warranty before and painting warranty was already over. The problem continued anyway, so painting peel off spread seriously. I asked the dealer to review it again last month, but their reply was same as last year. My friends were surprised at the appearance defects of my car as they haven't seen painting problem with their or other's. I know vehicle's painting process is complex and Hyundai has good technology for it. But, I think there was unstable factors in the manufacturing process which made bad quality of painting. I really want my car to be fixed as normal one.","384":"It seems to me that the problem of peeling paint should be something that would never occur in the era we are living in. There is enough technology out there that this should never occur. Shame on you Hyundia for not taking care of these problems when they first surfaced. A three year old car should not have it's paint coming off unless there was some sort of chemical spillage or wreck. This car was always kept clean and washed regularly with no accidents or anything spilled on it. This paint is cracking from poor materials period and Hyundia should immediately step up and fix it--WARRANTY OR NOT!!!!!!!","385":"Paint peeling on the hood, just identical to the one pictured on this site. Took to the dealership who took pictures, but Hyundai would not consider paying. Took to a body shop who was amazed that a little rock nick would cause such peeling of paint.

Mileage is high but have driven many cars much further and paint has never \"let go\" like this. Hyundai people are aware of this issue but refuse to take responsibility for the repair. Since the paint started peeling I have noticed quite a few other Hyundai's with the same problem.

There have been numerous attempts and replacement equipment to address and eradicate this situation and nothing has corrected the situation nor does Hyundai have any answers available to correct this situation. The vehicle has been in my favorite Hyundai service facility for many days and when finally returned the only answer I was given, was that the vehicle is an early production of the model and they have had some of same problem. In addition the electronic steering is a great disappointment as it is quite difficult to keep the vehicle on a true straight pathway no matter what the composition of the pavement. There was some sort of alert from the factory on an adjustment however and was addressed but is still terrible. Then there's an issue on the hitch whereby then trailer prep wiring was included on the invoice, installed by the selling dealer and the servicing dealer feels it not there duty\/responsibility to repair it. I have been a Hyundai customer since 2001 as this is a very great disappointment and besides safety issues. These issues must be cleared up asap by both the Hyundai manufacturer and straightened out with their dealers. Please !

It made a sharp right turn without my help at all. After hitting another vehicle and then jumping a large curb, I came to stop about 18\" from a small tree. I was completely traumatized. The right front wheel had a blow out from the outside side wall of the tire. The mechanic said it looked slashed. The big question is, did the blow out occur at the time my vehicle made the sharp right turn at the intersection, or did it occur when it hit the curb? I don't know, but I feel something happened to cause that sharp right turn in the first place. I had the mechanic check out the right front wheel area (axle, etc). They said they couldn't find anything wrong with the vehicles parts, that wasn't caused by the accident. This makes me more convinced it has to be the tire. This is the second tire that has blown out on the outside wall of the tire since I purchased this vehicle in 2013. The other blow out was from a nail going through the outside wall. I only have 11,045 miles on this vehicle. Tires are a kumho, crugen, P235\/55R19, 101H sl BSW oe (information copied from a discount tire receipt when the first blow out was replaced 5-22-15).

I purchased the vehicle new in early 2013, the problem has been there from day one. I have recently been informed that Hyundai has made a change to improve steering accuracy for the 2015 model year. An improved central processing unit (cpu) has been developed for the electric steering system. So Hyundai is well aware of the issue with the 2013 and 2014 model years.

I brought this info to the attention of my local dealership when it was recently time for the first service. After sharing info with them and even giving them a copy of a completed service order from a friend on one of the online forums, to my astonishment the dealership refused to fix my seat. The district service manager refused to authorize this repair because as he put it. \"I sat in a few 2013 sf's and they all did it\". the excuse of someone that wants to avoid admitting there is a problem. Just because they all do it does not mean there is not a problem as evidenced by the info I easily discovered on the internet. Hyundai has already authorized other repairs for other owners. I think that NHTSA should look into this and force Hyundai to come clean and authorize these repairs for all owners regardless of location or dealer\/district.-Johnstown, PA, USA","430":"I purchased a 2013 Santa Fe sport from Coconut Creek automall and I had this problem from week one. my trip A meter resets itself and I have gone back to the dealer many times. they put it on the computer and they say they can't find anything wrong.

Went to 2 dealers to have it checked and it came back normal. At the first dealer we checked with other Santa Fe's on the lot and all the same.My test drive Santa Fe did not have the seat cooling so I was basing the cooling on a test drive in a KIA Optima I did and the seat cooling system was really nice.If Hyundai is going to offer seat cooling they should have thought that high meant somewhat uncomfortable or chilly then let the lower speeds do the talking.The heated seats and steering are great though.","432":"Brand new car one thing after another breaking.

Actual measured MPG is around 16-18 MPG. MPG gauge as well as fuel remaining is totally WORTHLESS. Very disappointed in overall fuel consumption. NOT what was promised when I bought it.

The first time we used the navigation system, which was one of the reasons we bought the car, it didn't complete the sentences as to the proper places to turn. We also found ourselves yelling trying to get the system to understand and not send us to Texas when we said Florida. Or when I called BlueLink it would ring for 10 minutes and still no answer. When it sometimes answered and asked what you wanted and I said navigation then it sometimes would say what destination I would give them an address and it would say good bye.I have continued to notify BlueLink and they have continued to tell me they are working on it and assured me they will send an email when it is solved. In June I was upset as to the fact that it hasn't been fixed so I called Hyundai Corporate offices in California. They had a serviceman install a part and when that didn't fix it they then had me go down to the dealers close to our home and it worked 2 times out of a dozen directions given and they had no solution, I again tried to get the system to work and it couldn't even give me directions or find my home address when I was setting in the driveway.The last time I spoke to Maria in California I informed her that this has been going on for 10 months and if they can't get it fixed now or give me reasons for it not working they will be speaking to my attorney. We were given a complementary 6 months membership and we paid for another 6 month membership that we haven't been able to use in the past 10 months. It's time we get some satisfaction on this problem. They tell me I will have a year membership when & if they get the system working and yet they fail to send it in an email or to our address.

When I asked why, I was told because of a lack of maintenance. I offered to provide all of the receipts for maintenance that complied with the manufacturers recommendations and was told that wasn't necessary, they wouldn't honor the warranty anyway. What surprised me even more was the fact that the oil line that caused the problem was under recall and had been replaced during the service - but was told that was unrelated - interesting. Needless to say I had the car towed from the dealership to get a second opinion and was told that based on the maintenance record the damage couldn't have been caused by a lack of maintenance. After serving in the military for 35 years I've never been accused of lying about having maintenance performed. As a military pilot and aircraft owner I can attest to the importance of completing scheduled maintenance.

Suddenly the turbo appeared to stop working and I was revving the car up to 7,000 RPM with virtually no movement. When I stopped at a red light the vehicle stalled.The engine light came on and I immediately limped the car to the dealer who ran a thorough diagnostic. I was informed that the tip of the spark plug had burned\/blown itself up and went into the engine.The result is that I need a new block - $10,000 because the vehicle is no longer on warranty.THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY for a 3-year old car!!!!The dealer said there's no explanation for this. I've had the car serviced at the same dealer for 70,000 KM and only ever at Hyundai. I'm devastated. The cost will require me to either abandon the vehicle, of which I still owe 3 years of payments or repair it and risk losing my house.To-date, there's been no action from Hyundai. Just promises about getting calls back which have not yet occurred","486":"December 1, 2013 we Purchased the Santa Fe. On June 21,2014 After grocery shopping my family and I were on our way home when I tried to enter the freeway and accelerate the car would not speed up and began to jerk violently. I had to pull towards the shoulder to avoid being rear ended. Once the traffic had cleared I pulled out and tried again and it happen again, I let off the gas pedal and it stopped. I had to accelerate very slowly so the jerking would stop, any time you try to accelerate quickly it would Jerk and not pick up speed.On June 26,2014 my wife with our children took the car in at 10:00 am. I called my wife at 11:45 am to see if they had done a test drive she said no the car was still sitting there. I called her back at 12:57 pm and they had done the test drive and found that the car did have something very wrong with it and they had to do some diagnostics to figure out what was wrong. So my wife asked if there was a shuttle available they said none was available. So my family continued to wait. At 1:47 pm my wife called me at work saying they were stuck there because they don't have a shuttle. I told my wife I would call her back to go, and ask if there is an ETA for the diagnostics, and if not, if there is no shuttle what about a loner or a rent a car.So I called her back at 2:08 pm and she was told no to all of the above and the supervisor told her why she didn't bring the car in earlier. I had my wife put the service consultant on the phone and express to him that the reason we bought a new vehicle was so we didn't have to go through this, also I called in advance and made clear of the issue. My family has been there now for over 4 hours and you still don't know what's wrong. I asked to speak with the supervisor but he said she had just gone off to a meeting. I asked if he could please see what he could do. At 3:22 I called my wife back and they finally got her into a car so they could leave.On June 27,2014 at 10:20 am my wife got a call. They told her the High Pressure fuel pump needed to be replaced They said it's going to take about a week to get the part and put it in. They told her to bring the car she had back to switch it out for a Rental. When my wife went to pick up the rental. They were going to give her an Elantra.They told her that was the only car available. My wife said it was too small for a family of 5, that's the reason we purchased a Santa Fe. So they called Nissan to see if they had a car to loan. They had a van but it wasn't going to be back at 6 pm that evening. Instead they gave her a Altima to use for that day, and to come back the following day to switch it out for a Nissan Quest. So now another 2 days of our time wasted switching cars.On July 5,2014 the high pressure fuel pump was changed but the vehicle had the same issue. Now they would need to consult with a Technician from the Mainland. On July 16,2014 at 4:42 p.m They called with an update. They stated that in addition to the High pressure fuel pump they had to replace the fuel rail pressure sensor,remove the fuel tank and the fuel feed line because the fuel feed line had collapsed. They were going to do more testing the following day.On July 17,2014 at 2:52 p.m Jay called to say the car was completed. So almost a month to get it fixed and horrible customer service the whole way. Now my concern is how many factory seals needed to be broken to fix this. Also, since then more has gone wrong with the car. Will fill an other complaint.","487":"ThisF*CKINGvehicle just stopped working while we were on vacation due to my wife having Breast Cancer. We are supposed to have a Warranty, and you stupid MOFO's act as if we are supposed to accommodate you all. We actually applied for the Recall which originally mentioned it just being a latch, not theF*ckingEngine!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now thef*ckingcar is in the shop, we are trying to figure out about the Warranty. Your customer serviceF*CKINGSUCKS!!!!! I was trying to talk to the guy and the ASSHOLE only wanted to talk to my wife.If there was a recall on the Engine why not notify us properly. We submitted a card for it to be inspected, and you all never stated that it was a Engine Recall. Piece ofSh*t!!!!","488":"On April 25 my Santa Fe started making a very loud knocking noise while driving on a major highway. I had noticed a faint, occasional ticking noise for about 1 week prior to this but hadn't had the chance to bring it in. No warning lights ever came on. Prior to the warranty running out I had taken it in to the local dealer due to possible transmission slipping but no problem was found. There's a surprise!I pulled off the highway, stopped at a red light and the car stalled. I managed to get it started to get it out of the intersection, pulled off on a side street and towed to the dealer. The next day I was informed the lower half of the engine had to be replaced. All regular oil changes had been done and transmission service done at 96,000 km. The dealer stated a request had been sent to Hyundai Canada to cover the cost. I had just heard about a recall re:engine failure prior to this but had not received a letter in the mail yet. When I asked about that, the question was dodged and I was told I'd get a letter.We were told the dealer would arrange a courtesy car or a rental for us then a day later said they wouldn't. We got our own rental which they said they would reimburse us for. They haven't. After having the car for 1 MONTH it was fixed and Hyundai Canada did cover it so I have to give them a little credit there. While driving it home the battery light came on. Clearly they didn't check it before they gave it back. We reported it and were told \"I don't know why it would do that\". The light went off and it seemed to be ok until a few days later it just died in the middle of the street.Towed to Hyundai again and they said it was a fuse on the battery which can happen if it's jump started. We never jump started it so clearly they must have, but wanted us to pay for it. We argued and argued and finally the manager handed us the keys and we were gone. They were supposed to pay for that tow but haven't.I've since sold the car and will never buy another Hyundai again, even if it's the last car company on the earth.","489":"I was driving home in my santa fe, my engine suddenly lost power in the middle of the highway. I had to call a tow truck to bring my santa fe to my mechanic shop. The next day my mechanic told me my engine is broken down. We don\u2019t have any reason that this would happen because I recently changed the oil. That cost me $5,000 to buy a new engine without cost of service to install it. I don\u2019t understand why this happened because I do change of the oil frequently. I won\u2019t recommend this model of Hyundai to anybody.","490":"Began 6\/22\/17 idling, running rough (chugging), engine light came on. 6\/24\/17, while driving on a hilly country road at 55mph, the RPMs increased with no movement in the speed.

Not a safe place to be.","491":"Friday evening September 30 2016, my son was driving my car, he came home and informed the car engine had started making a very loud banging noise and he could feel the vibration. Saturday morning October 1,2016, we got in the car to make a 5 minute drive to my work, I heard the banging and told my son to go straight home, it was a terrifying sound. My son got on the freeway made it to the freeway exit when the card made one more horrible bang and then died, he was able to coast off the exit and stop on the side of the road. But he was lucky, honestly if the car had died any sooner on the freeway he could have been hit or worse, killed. I had the vehicle to the dealership, they ran a diagnostic and said the warranty would cover the repairs because the vehicle had had bad maintenance (which was NOT true). They quoted me 9800.00 dollars to replace the engine new, or 7900.00 used. They told me the vehicle had debris in the engine and they would not repair it! I had to pay out of pocket to fix my engine, two weeks ago I received a recall notice for my car engine, sighting debris in the engine due to bad manufacturing being the cause! I paid another automotive company to fix my car, because let's face it 9800.00 is the price of a new car, maybe not my car, but a new car none the less! This was my 3rd Hyundai purchase, and after this it will be my last, this company is dishonest and doesn't honor it's warranties!","492":"On a freeway on ramp the car started to lose power, sputter, and smoke started coming from under the hood. Dash lights lit up. Pulled off and noticed oil on the pavement. Car would not start. Dealer said not eligible for warranty because we hadn't completed all oil changes in under 3k miles. Had engine replaced and the mechanic said there were holes in the engine block. No explaination as to why this happened.","493":"April 3 2017 I was traveling home from work at 100 km per hour. My Santa Fe started to make these awful banging clanking noises like metal hitting. I managed to get off the highway and had it towed to the nearest Hyundai in Winnipeg. The service department said I had metal in my oil and I will need a new engine....the cost $5,000 to $7,000 dollars. I had to gather my 4 years of records and sent to dealership so they could plead my case to Hyundai Canada. Now I am waiting to hear back.We have had several vehicles ...Chevy Ford GMC and even another Hyundai and we have never had engine issues. We drove these vehicles 220,000 to 305,000 km and sold them. Never ever had engine fail!I am Hoping Hyundai Canada will do the right thing as this Santa Fe is my first LEMON. and I cannot afford this repair","494":"While accelerating to merge into traffic the engine started making an unusual sound, kind of a rattle. When letting off the accelerator and just cruising with traffic everything sounded normal. The noise came and went throughout various driving conditions. The next day the engine quit and my wife was able to cost safely off of an exit onto the shoulder. I was able to get it restarted and drove it to the dealer. After hearing the knocking sound and metal in the oil they said it needs a new engine. Quoted a little over $7,000 to replace the engine. The dealer submitted a request to Hyundai for assistance with the cost of replacing the engine. Hyundai offered $1,000. Only 6,000 miles out of warranty, all services performed on time and they only want to offer $1,000? It was really an insult. With the $1,000 from Hyundai it would have still been close to, if not a little over $7,000 by the time they finished with the extra charges (you need a new belt, oh the spark plugs need replaced...) and taxes. I don't have $7,000 so I brought my trailer to the dealer loaded up the car and took it home. I have started disassembly but have not gotten far enough into the engine to identify the actual cause.Update from Feb 6, 2017:After disassembly I discovered one of the rod bearings has spun in the connecting rod. New crankshaft, all new main and rod bearings, and a new connecting rod are on order. so far the cost of parts will be just about $1,000.00Update from Feb 27, 2017:After completing disassembly I discovered all main bearings had significant damage consistent with metal debris on the bearing surface.","495":"Santa Fe started to smoke really badly. Had to tow it to have it checked, the Hyndai service department siad we need a new engine. They had not even looked at the car at this point. They simple made a \"diagnosis\" based on what we reported. We are second owners so they did not honor the 100,000 power train warranty. Hyundai finally agreed to have a look at the engine to diagnose the problem. They agreed to pay for the labor to take the engine apart to examine it. They said it blow a rod and we were responisble to pay for a repair ( a $8000 estimate for an other engine) . They said we failed to maintain the the car even though we showed prove of routine oil changes ! I am very disappointed in Hyundai and I beleive there is something fundamentally wrong with the engine that was in the car. We are currently having the car fixed still after a month without transportation and are waiting for a rebuilt engine which are on \"backorder\" , maybe that's because there is a major probelm with this engine. I would not recommend this car to my worse enemy!!!! I will never buy an other Hyundai in my life :-(","496":"I took my car in to the dealer for routine oil change and tire rotation. The service advisor came out and asked me if I had a recent blowout. I said no. She said when the tech rotated the tire he noticed a bulge in the sidewall of the rear passenger tire. They advised it was dangerous to drive it that way, so they put the spare on. One other tire was showing cable. Both tires are at 5\/32. I bought this car used, in June 2015. Car fax showed no reports of any issues, however, there was noticeable body work and repaint (poorly done and I have pictures). The previous owner had a blowout in the less than 12 months they had the vehicle. They never reported it, but the dealer mentioned it. I have 19\" tires on my Santa Fe sport 2.0T. Is it possible the recall on the 17\" tires should have included the 19\" tires as well? these are still the original tires. I haven't owned the car a year yet.

Passengers, especially in the back seat, could experience motion sickness due to the constant side-to-side corrections. Noticed the problem is worse on larger highways, 3-4 lanes wide.

Oddly, this is most noticeable on smooth, straight, level highways without wind or other vehicles nearby that could affect the tracking of the vehicle. It seems to be an alignment issue (neg. Or 0 deg toe) or an electric power steering system issue (torque sensor too coarse, drive motor too aggressive, or improper gain (I.e. system responds too late to input, then over responds when it does respond))...though these are educated guesses. My first dealers refused to check the alignment because they \"have to drive the vehicle to confirm the issue, \" and \"they are not allow to drive over 65 mph.\" Even if they were able to drive above 65 mph, they would have to do it on the right type of highway and under the right conditions for the issue to show itself, and I doubt many dealers will go through such an effort.

The vehicle would not maintain a straight path while driving at highway speed. Sf required continuous correction at a varying degree. It is not only that the vehicle wonders, but it does so mildly and aggressively. The vehicle tends to sway and rock all while trying to correct for the continuous wondering. It's a very odd sensation that occurs, just when you think you might go straight for a bit the vehicle will dart to one side and it has no rhythm or reason. Sometimes left sometimes right and the road crown plays no part in the direction. Dealer aligned all 4 wheels twice. Added toe in and camber to the rear. Also, replaced rear springs and shocks. Turns out one of the springs was shorter than the other by 1\/4\" causing the suspension to be unbalanced. This repair helped for some of the unexplained rocking but now that it is fixed the whole steering issue has been exacerbated. I don't feel safe in the vehicle and intend on selling it. Currently, it has 11K miles. I logged another complaint with Hyundai customer service today too. The fact that potential buyers rarely get to drive the new car for more than 7-10 miles and at speeds rarely above city is a disservice. If Hyundai knows this problem exists and government oversight knows, than it is deceitful and dishonest. Lastly, this vehicle behaves in the same manner as one with worn out ball joints that would not pass a state safety inspection. Yet these Santa fes are still being sold. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Buyer beware!-Concord, NC, USA","528":"I was told that the dealer never saw any thing like this before, now I find it all over the internet.","529":"I live and work in the city and county, tucson, Arizona. In the county there are generally no street lights at road intersections. My new car (2015 Hyundai Santa Fe) does not have any running lights on the side that provide side illumination at night. I have had multiple incidents when making right and left hand turns onto streets\/roads without street lights where my car's lights do not illuminate the road I am turning onto until I completely make the turn. In several instances as I made the turn I could not see the road and I over shot the turn and drove well onto the berm and was able to stop and steer back onto the road or I turned too soon. Another instance was when I went down an embankment and was able to stop before hitting the bottom. Luckily these were no accidents involving vehicle damage or personal injury\/death. The only way that I can see the side street, road or driveway I am turning onto is to turn on my bright lights. Obviously, this is very upsetting to oncoming drivers and a potential safety issue. In addition, at night when stopped or driving straight there is a black void approximately 15 feet in front of the vehicle. On one occasion I practically ran over an obstacle since it was too dark to see it. I took the SUV to my Hyundai dealer and explained the problems. Their solution is to use the fog lamps all the time at night. This addresses the black void in front of the car. It does not solve the right\/left turn road lighting issue unless I used my high beams to execute the turn. They said that they were not aware of this type of complaint by other owners. I asked if they would contact the field representative to see if there are any fixes to this problem. To date, I have not had a reply. I am not happy with this headlamp design defect since it puts my passengers, other drivers, and myself at risk.-Vail, AZ, USA","530":"I have had problems with the car in the past but was repaired by the dealer.

I was stuck on the side of the road with the glass literally falling in on us. I closed the cover and we drove very slowly (about 15 miles) to a place where we could vacuum up the glass.

The key fob is designed such that a very slight amount of pressure on a button can remove the entire electronic portion of the key inadvertently. If this is done on accident and the electronic portion of the key cannot be found then the car will not start. Contrary to most key fob designs, where the metal key (valet) portion flips out from the body or has to be removed using some force, the key fob on the new Santa Fe will detach without almost any force. I have already lost a fob at a cost of $280 to me and the key has become detached multiple times in pockets and around the house without hardly any force. I believe this is a design issue and consumer protection issue that needs to be addressed. It seems Hyundai designed this part for the sole goal of increasing replacement key fob sales.-Los Angeles, CA, USA","574":"Blind spot detection stop working while driving and the driver screen said bsd canceled. I parked the car stop the engine and after restarting the bsd started to working again.-Hialeah, FL, USA","575":"Hyundai Santa Fe sport. Can start\/stop engine in various gear including reverse. Purchased April 10, 2014. After driving my new Hyundai for a week or so, decided to wash it. My habit is to wipe out the hatch and under the hood. Upon opening the hood discovered no coolant in reservoir. Evident there never was any from the factory. Month later replaced back-up camera. 5 months later shifted to reverse navigation system went totally black. Couldn't get service appointment until week and half later. One week to date, after navigation blacked-out while in park and no one inside auto drifted back. Vehicle was damaged. Found Hyundai Santa Fe can start or stop in various gear including reverse which is dangerous. I could never feel safe driving the auto again. Filed complaint with Hyundai motor America eating for resolution.-Irwin, PA, USA","576":"Santa Fe would start fine in the morning\/Cold start however after short trips it would intermittently not start. When pressing the start button it would repeatedly attempt to start. After repeated attempts to start and or waiting up to 15 to 30 minutes and trying again it would eventually start. Multiple visits and days left it at Dealer as it was hard for them to replicate on demand to diagnose. Once they actually witnessed it not starting they decided to replace the high pressure fuel pump, however a day later it would not start again. After it happened a few more times the engine light finally lit and the dealer was able to diagnose the issue as the Intake valve VIC Solenoid and the Crank Shaft Position Sensor. We just got it back again and are hoping this fixes the issue.","577":"I'm writing this letter because the Hyundai Motor Company and other major car makers are not addressing a serious issue with their wiring harnesses and related wiring components. I recently had to replace my wiring harness, assorted sensors and the vehicles inboard computer due to rodents chewing on the wiring. I own a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. It was in the shop from July 6th to July 20th for these repairs. There repairs totaled just under $6,000.00 Fortunately my auto comprehensive covered all but the deductible. I was not offered a loaner car because this was not a warranty issue.A little Google research has enlightened me to the fact that this is not at all that uncommon, there have been thousands of cases this has been happening for years. Some years ago in an attempt to produce greener products , the maker of the wiring insulation changed to a soy based product. Well it should be no surprise that mice, chipmunks, squirrels, etc would be attracted to this product. These wiring products are in Toyotas, Hyundais, GM, Nissans and who knows how many other.Now back to my dealership, I asked the service person if they had many cases of rodent damage and he acknowledged that they did. Then I asked what he thought would be attracting rodents to the wiring, he said the insulation contains a soy based material. At this point I asked him why would the manufacturer continue to use this product knowing that this problem existed. His answer was that they don't make the wiring harness and that it's contracted out(kind of like airbags). So then I asked if they weren't responsible for the products that go into their vehicles even from third party vendors,I got basically a blank look. It's not covered under your warranty sir so check your insurance. So here we have the auto industry aware of a problem for years and have not taken any action to fix the problem(shameful). I'm far from an expert in wiring and electronics , but I would surmise this could be a safety hazard, fortunately my vehicle was not driveable . Could this issue cause power steering failure, brake failure or fires? I don't know but it's something to think about. Consumers have probably spent millions of dollars in repairs concerning this issue. People with auto comprehensive are the lucky ones but ultimately everyone's premiums have to be affected.The auto industry out of greed has no reason to fix this seemingly easy to fix problem. Why would they? No warranty coverage and an insurance industry that just pays claims. Its the proverbial cash cow.","578":"They tell me that they do not want to start replacing parts unless they know which one it is. Apparently there is a sensor on left and right side. The cost is about 1200 bucks each plus labor. Now that the car is out of warranty I wonder if I am just SOL unless I pay for it. Doesn't happen all of the time, except when I am driving the car and the dealership is closed. Does not save the error in the computer. Shutting the car off and then on clears it till the next time it goes out.","579":"On three occasions now, I have nearly hit a pedestrian in a crosswalk, because I did not see that pedestrian. All three were hidden from my view by a combination of the driver side mirror and the frame of the car on the left side of the windshield. Together, the placement of these two features creates a surprisingly large blind spot. I think it is partly related to the fact that the seats in the car also cannot be raised enough; I have good front visibility, but if I could get higher I do think the mirror might be less of an obstacle. Each time this has happened, I learn a new type of situation in which I must not trust what I see, but I worry about unanticipated situations in the future.-Hollister, CA, USA","580":"The front windshield cracked when parked. It had always had a haze when the wipers were used that never cleared. The dealer tried new blades and various window treatments. But nothing ever worked. Always seemed to be faulty manufactured glass. The rear window continues to have the same problem and I am afraid it will crack also.-Salem, OR, USA","581":"The contact owns a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe. While driving 65 mph, the panoramic sun roof fractured out on the roadway without warning. The fabric closure was shut, which prevented the fragments from entering the top portion of the sun roof when the failure occurred. The vehicle was driven to the contact's residence and parked. The dealer was notified of the failure and asked the contact to tow the vehicle to the dealer for diagnostic testing. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 52,000.-Snohomish, WA, USA","582":"I was driving down a two lane road about noon on Dec. 22. the temperature was about 70. I was going approximately 60 mph. I was not turning, just going straight down the road. It sounded like there was an explosion. I pulled off the road as the glass sunroof shattered and fell in on my daughter and me. There was no other car near me. Nothing hit my car. I called Hyundai was told that it wasn't covered by them and would be my responsibility to have fixed. I was stuck on the side of the road with the glass literally falling in on us. I closed the cover and we drove very slowly (about 15 miles) to a place where we could vacuum up the glass. It was in both the front and back seats. We cut our hands trying to clean it up but we had no choice. The glass continued to fall as we drove and rain was predicted. We had to do our best to be able to drive it another 30 miles to place to get it worked on. It's been 24 days (yes, rental car fees!) and I still and waiting on my car. I don't want the sunroof any longer because I'm scared it will happen again but I think I'm stuck with it. The man at the repair place believes it was a faulty pressure regulator. I don't have any receipts for the repairs yet because I still don't have my car back. It was very scary and not sure what would happen to someone driving on a busy highway if this occurs.-Round Top, TX, USA","583":"I was driving about 45 mph on an open road, little to no traffic. The sunroof in my Santa Fe spontaneously exploded. We heard a very loud bang. A large piece of glass flew up and out of my car. Several small pieces of glass fell into the car, on me and my 9 year old daughter (who was in the backseat\/driver side). The falling glass ranged from slivers to pea sized to larger than 2 inches. The glass continued to fall into the car. I closed the sunshade on the sunroof to try to keep the rest of the falling glass off of us. I was only about 1\/2 mile from home. I drove home and parked in my garage. The panoramic sunroof has 2 pieces of glass. The entire front panel was shattered, and had a large hole just to the right of center. This was after 6pm. I called the Hyundai dealership first thing the next morning. The service person I spoke to stated this was the 2nd exploding sunroof they have seen this month. I had the car towed to the dealership. When we got to the dealership the rest of the sunroof had shattered and fallen into the car. The car was filled with glass. I had 2 small glass slivers in my hand that I easily removed. I have a small glass sliver in my chin still. My daughter has a few small scratches on her stomach (she was wearing a cropped sports top).-Canton, GA, USA","584":"Driving on hwy 71 approximately 25 miles South of alexandria, la with the sunroof closed and the interior sunroof liner closed when I heard a loud \"explosion\" similar to the sound of a shotgun being fired. There was only one vehicle near me, approximately 500 feet ahead of me. I looked to see if the side window had been shot out and to make sure my son, who was sitting in the back, was ok. I then could hear the sound of wind coming from above me. I opened the sunroof cover and discovered a large hole in the forward part of the sunroof, with the remainder of the forward retractable sunroof shattered. I pulled over to the side of the road and noticed that it appeared that the sunroof released upward. I have taken the vehicle to a Hyundai dealer and they are trying to say this is the result of something striking the sunroof, and that they have \"not seen this before\". I have done research and see that there have been several complaints of this happening including a recent recall of Hyundai velosters for the same problem.-Gretna, LA, USA","585":"About 4 pm on Oct 6, 2014, I was driving South on route 101S toward yarmouth, nova scotia, Canada at mile marker 16. It is a 2 lane restricted access highway. There were 2 people in the front seats, one person in the middle row, passenger side. The day was partly sunny, mid 60S, little wind. My sunroof was tilted open and the liner was open halfway to expose the sun roof opening. The speed limit on the road was 100km\/hr, and that was my speed. A tractor trailer passed me going the opposite direction, probably at 100 km\/hr or a little more. Just as the truck disappeared in my blind spot there was a huge explosion. It sounded like a canon went off just above me. I looked up and saw a huge hole in the sunroof and there was glass all over me, my passengers, and the inside of the car. I immediately slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road when it was safe. I did not hear anything hit the car, nor did we and 3 royal Canadian mounted police find any sign of anything that could have caused the damage after searching both inside the car and along the roadway. About 60 percent of the sun roof was gone, shattered into bits throughout the front, middle and even some into the back of the car. The outside part of the sun roof that was still attached was also entirely shattered. I proceeded directly to a Hyundai dealer who took pictures to document the damage. A warranty repair was authorized. After inspection and cleaning, the sun roof and liner operated correctly, with damage limited to the glass portion of the sunroof. No other roof damage was noted.

No impact with any object. Driver and passenger showered with broken glass. Car purchased new only two months ago.-Carrollton, TX, USA","588":"Panoramic sunroof, the section of glass that opens, exploded while driving 70 mph down the interstate. There were no cars within 1\/4 mile of me, and no overhead bridges, so nothing hit the roof, it just exploded. In fact, looking from the exterior, it is clear that the glass blew outward, because the perimeter of the whole is convex facing outward, and most all of the glass, including the wind guard were blown onto the highway. The upholstery liner was ripped as well. So thankful that I was by myself, and that my 8 year old daughter and wife were not in the car. In my mind, this is clearly a manufacturer's defect. Could you imagine if a windshield were to do this?? you never hear that happening, so they are obviously cutting corners on these sunroof panels. Hyundai is repairing it for free, but I will always be paranoid about it happening again.-Huntsville, AL, USA","589":"The Smart keys is design to come apart. However this falls apart all the time most times we have been lucky to find it. In july it separated and it was never found. We were given two keys and it happens with both of them. the repair is about 300.00 to replace. This seems very unfair as it is clearly a design flaw. I have not figured out how to start my car without it.","590":"When pulling the fuel door release the fuel door does not always open, have to pull the release multiple times. Mentioned to dealer and they lubed the fuel door release and stated sometimes the string that attaches to the gas cap can get in the way... Waiting to see if that is all it was or not.","591":"When driving over 30 mph, it sounds like the driver and front passenger doors or windows aren't completely shut - loud wind noise comes through. I took it into a dealer and they said the noise comes from the side mirrors and that there's nothing they can do about it. So I just have to deal with my car sounding like the windows are cracked whenever I drive faster than a school zone.","592":"There was a snow\/sleet storm this past Friday and I didn't bother to even go outside, let alone try to leave the house. Trying to leave this morning, after using the auto-start option once and running the car an additional almost 15 minutes - with the defrost on full blast to break up\/loosen the sheet of ice on my windshield, I went to leave my house - with my infant in the backseat - and noticed that almost the whole low-to-mid windshield was cracked. Obviously ruining my plans, I called Hyundai customer service and they told me I had to call roadside assistance. All of this back and forth and then I requested a tow, as I wasn't going to drive 45 minutes to the dealership with my child in the back, I was able to take my vehicle in after my husband got home - since they told me it needed to be inspected. I drove all the way out there and they told me that it's not covered and to call my insurance. For ICE shattering my windshield, I have to pay more out-of-pocket? I've had 6 GM vehicles and lived in a much colder climate and NEVER had an issue. This is my 2nd foreign make vehicle (the 1st was a Honda Civic and that car required a windshield and driver side window) and the 2nd time I need a new windshield. Seems that these foreign make vehicles want to charge an arm and leg for junk, especially on windshields, which are pretty crucial components of a vehicle, and contribute to one's safety, as well as determining if one is going to be written a ticket for it. I'm done with them and will not buy another one of their vehicles.","593":"My girlfriend was driving to work on HWY 580 in Reno, when for no reason the sunroof shattered. Glass came in all over her and the back seat. The dealer said something must have hit it...WRONG. I looked on line and this has happened numerous times but no recall has been made. Thank God she was not cut or injured.The dealership kept the car for almost 2 weeks and covered it under the warranty. This would not have been good if there had been small children in the back seat. If it happens again, I will have to take further action and get another vehicle without the panoramic sunroof.","594":"Sunroof shatters. Hyundai said they did not know anything about any sunroofs shattering.","595":"This is the (2nd) time in less than a month Hyundai will not fix","596":"Driving in stop and go traffic (5-20 mph), when I stepped on the brakes with normal pressure for this type of city driving. At this time I heard a loud grinding noise and I had to drive off the road to avoid hitting the car ahead because the vehicle did not stop. It took longer and much more pressure than just a regular tap on the brake needed to stop it at this speed. I drive on this road every day and there was nothing wrong with the road or weather. I called roadside assistance and had it towed to the dealership. No problem was identified. I am no w afraid to drive this vehicle for fear of repeat incident.-San Antonio, TX, USA","597":"June15,2015 experienced complete brake failure while driving near home.somehow made it into my driveway w\/O incident. Had vehicle towed to dealership that afternoon.

This happens regardless of speed, brake\/ acceleration\/ cruise control, type of road, direction or movement etc. Often times while the car is parked or in motion, the seat will not move at all in any direction. Also, the ABS, traction control, and downhill light have all been turning on and off at random, and, while parked and without provocation, my speedometer needle began jumping. Less important, the driver's seat A\/C does not work consistently which leads me to believe this is an electrical malfunction, however, the multiple times I have taken this vehicle into the \"service center\", the mechanics said they could not recreate the problem and sent my broken car home, so the official reason is unknown.

For some reason it's just stop working from a few hours and it's turn on again by itself. I can read in the dash screen the warning (bsd no working). I make an appointment with Hyundai service center but they can't help me because the car don't give to them any code regarding this problem.

Im stuck in another province now and cant go home because they cant even offer the courtesy car... The service is bad... I always have to call and find out. This is a Santafe CRDi 4WD but the two Hyundai dealers cant fix their own car...The treatment is bad and only to think I use to defend this car when everyone was saying why am I not buying a German car. I have no confidence it the car anymore. I will never have a peace of mind driving that same car again. I need the car to be replacedThe car has a noise on the back wheel (Scratching brake pads). When you drive forward it moves still with that noise but you shift to Reverse gear, the car locks the back wheels and wont move.

I kept hearing wind whooshing through the cabin of my car, and finally I opened up the fabric cover of my sunroof and my sunroof was completely blown out! there were no trucks with rocks or any other means by which this sunroof could have shattered like that.

I drove back from a long day in Kelowna to Kamloops, BC. After Vernon I noticed that my gas pedal wouldn't react. I drove a bit over to the side while I did the pedal got hard and didn't respond, my steering wheel locked up and the whole car stank. I turned on the warning lights. Tried to get my phone to call help - no phone reception no cell service....Took my sweater of to clean my lights , so cars can clearly see my warning lights...as the snow was melting and the roads made my car very dirty. Packed the most important stuff - was scared as it smelled bad and hitch hiked to the next town Falkland. Called the Automobile Club they said they would just tow me 25 km or miles it would be around 82 on way ... and I am about 8 km closer to Vernon and they have to tow me to Vernon.OMG what to do .. I called Dons towing and they said they will pick me up and bring my car to Hyundai in Kamloops. Still waiting at the Ranch Cafe in Falkland 4 hours later the tow truck picks me up, we drive to my car .... Thursday night. I am home..... Friday I am calling my boss if he can pick me up to work. I call Hyundai tell them about my car.... they ask me if I purchased extended warranty.... I didn't. They said they can't start anything before I have all my service receipts with them.... at this time it was Friday afternoon and I had all but one with them.They also said to me at this point that they wouldn't pay for a rental car.... I felt very depressed and disappointed...I got them the one missing service receipt Friday late afternoon. I was very disappointed I had not missed a single service and I got treated like I did something wrong....After sharing my story with a friend, about a week later, he said I should call a different dealer ship. They helped me and even said that they involved Hyundai Canada. I received a call the next day Friday and the service manager called me and said that they have decided to pay for my rental car...I haven't heard back for over a week - I finally called and asked if they have an update. They said yes it is the engine the whole engine is shredded.... I heard from Kelowna that they have the problem with 7 other models from the same Series. I am in my rental car (what is very inconvenient since 4 weeks) no skiing, my son can't drive it and I can't take my samples to my clients as the car is to small. .... I am very happy to have a car after all. Even if we have to make sacrifices to our live and work. Last week they told me that it can take another 6 weeks as I get a brand new engine (from Korea) and today they called me and told me that they might get one in this week from Toronto. I am not happy and don't feel comfortable with the whole situation. Please advise what to do.... Any suggestions. Also if this happens to so many cars, why don't they recall it and put peoples lives at risk.","641":"This same problem (loss of power) first happened prior to 10,000 miles but than it was occurring at slower speeds. It did show a code. I took it into the dealer for service. They told me that the software had the fuel pressure set too low. The problem seemed to disappear and they cleared the code.Today I was passing a large truck on a two lane highway. Just as I was even with the long truck, power suddenly disappeared. I must have been going around 80mph. I was able to brake and get over to the shoulder. I killed the engine and restarted it and the problem disappeared. I called the dealer and told the service manager about what happened and that there was no code showing. All he told me was that it just cleared itself. Duh! This is the sort of thing that could get somebody killed.Coming back home from the above trip, I got to thinking about duplicating what happened so I got up to cruising speed at 65mph and than suddenly accelerated. At just about 80mph or maybe a little over, the engine cut out and I started slowing. As it started slowing to around 50mph, I pushed down on the accelerator again and nothing happened. I pulled over, killed and restarted the engine and the problem went away.I repeated this twice more (same trip) and got the same results each time. At around 80 to 85mph, power was lost. I placed a call to the service manager at the dealer. I am now waiting for him to return my call.Again, I just want to emphasize that this sort of thing will get somebody killed.Update from Aug 11, 2015:As of 10 August 2015, the vehicle is in the dealer service center and they provided me with a loaner vehicle.  On the way to the dealer that morning, I duplicated the loss of power problem once again.  Once arriving at the dealer, the service manager duplicated the engine shutdown problem by running it up to 80+ mph.  The manager thinks the problem is caused by low rail pressure (gas line) at that speed but they need time to evaluate it.  They did say that they have not encountered this problem previously although it has obviously been reported for older Santa Fe vehicles by others which can be found by searching \"loss of power\" and \"Hyundai Santa Fe\" on the Internet.  According to the service manager, the engine service light came on and indicated a failure code which did not happen for me. We are now in a waiting mode.Update from Aug 13, 2015:I had a call from the service manager this morning (August 13) and he informed me that they had determined that the problem seemed to be the double walled fuel line coming from the high pressure pump to the low pressure pump in the tank. They ordered the new line and it just arrived. They will be putting it in along with a new high pressure fuel pump. They think that the double wall line got kinked in shipping to the factory for vehicle assembly causing a flow restriction. Since junk could have got into the high pressure pump, they decided it would be best to replace the pump. We should know in a few days if this fixes the problem.","642":"I purchased a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 1 week ago today. It has 450 miles on it.

I drove it straight to the dealer where they have said that they have never heard of this. However, there are pages and pages of the same type of problem on the the internet. I called the manager and told them that I do not want this car. I will never feel safe or have piece of mind. It's totally unreliable and that they should take it back since I've only had it a week. I was told that they won't take it back. I am willing to buy another Sonata, but I will not take this car back especially since there really is no explanation for why this happens. California (Corporate) told me that there have only been recalls on 2010. 2011 and 2012's for the same problem. They claim that it's the engine control module.

We had to write e-mails to Hyundaiusa to get a case number and were then pushed off to the regional consumer affairs office before anyone could give us answers.Are biggest concern now is \"how reliable will this car be after the engine is replaced?\" We are concerned about this being installed misaligned, so drivetrain wear, tire wear, parts and pieces wearing out and of course wires, torque settings on bolts, etc...

My car was not due for another oil change until February. They reported that there was little oil in the vehicle and sludge. My car is only 2yrs old everyone I've spoken to has said that even if i didn't change the oil the vehicle is so new it shouldn't have caused that kind of damage. I did maintain my vehicle with regular oil changes because i didn't do it at Hyundai they are refusing to cover the cost. The dealership itself has been horrendous to deal with, not returning my calls, when i asked to speak with the GM they said they didn't have one and refused to give me any contact information. The service manager told me there were metal shavings in my engine and then back tracked and said oh wait i deal with a lot of cars maybe it wasn't yours, let me check. She has yet to respond to that question and refused to send me pictures or documentation of what's wrong or a written estimate to fix it. I've heard that there was a similar issue with the Sonata's having problems with the engines seizing. At a loss with what to do at this point. Fair warning, don't buy a Hyundai.","674":"Just found this website, but want to let you know about this experience. Can't remember the exact date or exact mileage..... but I kept hearing a strange noise around what sounded like the area of my front tires. After hearing this 3 times, over a 2 month period, I took it to the shop. They found my engine mount was broken. Service guy, said he had never seen that before, especially on a new vehicle like mine. Replaced with warranty, no charge and a rental car too.","675":"Dealership has had vehicle for 2 days and still can not figure out what is wrong","676":"I had BlueLink Remote Services on my Santa Fe and recently renewed the services. However, my remote services stopped working sometime before the renewal date. I didn't think much of it until I couldn't get them to work after the contract renewal. To make a long story short, after numerous calls and service appointments I discovered that I don't get any cell coverage on my driveway. The problem is only my driveway and approximately 1\/2 mile radius. When I call in to BlueLink all I get is a statement that cell coverage can be spotty and Hyundai has no control over cell. I find this very offensive as the service used to work fine so either Hyundai changed carriers or the local cell tower has a problem. Trying to get someone in BlueLink to look into why the service has stopped working is an impossibility. I'm sure someone in Hyundai knows who the carrier is and can refer the problem for repair. Why do they treat their customer's like morons?","677":"We bought the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe AWD 2.OT with it totally loaded. I invited on the cooling seats, which added a considerable amount to the car with that package. Anyhow, when we purchased the vehicle, the cooling seats worked well. You could feel the air blow in the seat cushion and in the back of the seat. Very comfortable. It actually got too cold at times, but you could definitely feel the air flowing.Now, we can't feel a thing. The drivers side seat you can't feel anything coming from it. The back of the seat you can feel it get cold. The passenger's seat you can hardly feel anything unless the car has been running for close to 30 minutes. We took it into the dealership (now two different times) and they don't see anything wrong with it. We have gotten customer support involved and they will not do anything further to help with getting the seats back to the way they were when we purchased the car.I'm so frustrated. I bought the car because of high customer satisfaction and of course the ventilated seats sealed the deal for me. Anyone experience this issue?","678":"I bought my 2015 Santa Fe on May 19 2016 \"pre owned\". I did not notice that it could not receive AM stations. As soon as I realized it I took the car to my local Hyundai dealer in Virginia Beach VA. I got completely stone walled and they said AM was hard to get in this area (not true), so I took it to the Hyundai dealer in Chesapeake VA and they said it was the radio and it needed to be replaced at a cost of $1400. Both dealers encouraged me to subscribe to Sirius radio as the previous owners had done. I have been taking portable radio with me in the car to get AM. I tell everybody why.I want AM radio to get local news and I feel like this is a defect in the car and Hyundai should come clean about it. I get no help from the local dealers. I used to have a Toyota and I know I would not have been treated this way by Toyota.","679":"It's inconceivable a $40,000. car can be sold with a bad antenna that can only get 1 AM & 3 FM stations and no one discovered it until sold. It's been over a month since reported & examined by the Hyundai dealer who sold it to me (Paid cash). The new antenna is due in next week (one month & 2 days time). Evidently takes that long to acquire one and paint it to match the car (color matched rooftop shark fin antenna)Sirius Satellite Radio reception was OK... just the AM\/FM. They said no one listens to AM radio anyway. Tell that to my wife.Other than that the car is incredible in every respect ... especially the turbo engine.Update from Mar 16, 2017:Problem was resolved after a total time of 3 months. Turns out the antenna was NOT the problem... it was the main\nantenna wire connector loose\/damaged in the vicinity of the front windshield. Replacing this cable allowed the car to\nreceive AM stations although poorly. The Hyundai only got 10 stations where my Honda CRV and Toyota pickup\nboth received more than 20 stations Why was their initial diagnosis so flawed ? (Poor troubleshooting) They even\nlied once & suggested they fixed the problem when they did NOT. I did see an AD in the newspaper afterwards for\na master mechanic at the dealership in question. I also saw articles on the net that Hyundai AM radio reception,\nin general, was substandard with the rest of industry. Coming up on 2 years now the car is perfect at 9,000 miles.","680":"Should be a recall here.

It sounded like a gun shot in my right ear, then glass began to fall on my head and throughout the car - I'm sure the majority of it was sucked out and onto the interstate. (I had the sun shade inside opened so my child could watch the rain on the ride to the babysitters.)I found others with the same problem when I googled it. Car was towed to dealership and issue would be covered under warranty I was told, I was given a loaner while it was fixed. No other vehicles in front of or behind me within 4 car lengths at least. I did not pass under an overpass. It was raining that day (of course - that's my luck) when I got to work I closed the sun shade on the inside as best as I could with all the glass that was in the track, and taped garbage bags over it to preserve the inside. I went to dealership later to take additional pictures and you can tell the glass was blow outwards. There was even chips in the paint through the clear coat from when glass flew. I'm thankful I was the only one in the car at the time, but my child's car seat is full of glass remains. I wasn't hurt - only a few cuts from glass that was in my jacket pocket and in my clothes. I am still at a loss as to what happened, how and why - unknown. And so far the dealership has not communicated anything to me, but I hope they make it right.-Charlotte, NC, USA","690":"The panoramic sunroof spontaneously shattered while driving at night on the highway at about 70mph - the sound was like a gunshot inside the car - this is a Santa Fe sport 2016 model that I bought on July 5 2015-El Paso, TX, USA","691":"When passenger does not buckle their seat belt there is only a SMALL light on the dash that doesn't even blink, to alert you.

Then I took the car to NJ and I had some issues with it going down the hill (less than the 6% grade). The car would down shift just I got to the bottom and it would send the RPMs to at least 5 and I quickly took the cruise off. It did this at least 4 times before I decided not have the car in cruise fear of burning the motor up. I took the car in to the Hyundai dealership and was told that is normal. That is not normal. I have driven other manufactures cars (Volvo, Lincoln, Ford, Chevy, Toyota, Buick, VW, and GMC) and my wife's car is a Tucson and NONE of them have down shifted that badly (almost like being in 2nd gear).","703":"Observed problem shortly after buying new Santa Fe. When cruise control is engaged and vehicle downshifts to maintain speed, either to decrease speed going downhill or increase speed going uphill, it will take forever(if it ever does)to return back to the gear it was in before the downshift. Usually I will cancel cruise to get it to up-shift back to the original gear, which may be 500-1000 RPM's above where it was before the downshift. Service manager at dealer said this was normal and her Santa Fe did the same thing.Every automatic I've owned before with cruise has downshifted smoothly and returned to previous gear(usually one gear away) very smoothly.

While driving in low speed traffic suddenly, while my fiance rear ended someone. To this day she cannot figure out what happened. She is a careful driver, does not speed and knows that the area were she was driving is high traffic and was coming up to a red light. Both of her hands were on the wheel and she wasn't on a phone or anything. She believes she hit the breaks, and as stated before still does not know what happened. After reading these complaints we are wondering if we had the same issue as someone else who reported and is the cause of the accident. We figured we would report this. We are also wondering if other people are having similar accidents since there has been a major issue getting parts to repair said car (car has now been off the road for 11 weeks most parts required for repair have been externally backordered and Hyundai has been extremely unhelpful to help us get our car repaired)-Saddle Brook, NJ, USA","725":"The contact owns a 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe. When the contact depressed the brake pedal, the vehicle accelerated aggressively. The contact continued to depress the brake pedal multiple times for the vehicle to stop.

The VIN was not available.-Norwalk, CA, USA","726":"Within days of having the vehicle, I noticed that when cruise control was on, it would sense things (people jogging, vehicles) next to me instead of in front of me, and would dramatically (and dangerously) engage the brakes. Now, the system is supposed to activate when it senses a vehicle IN FRONT OF it so that it can maintain a safe distance behind it. However, this happened when a person was jogging on the sidewalk next to me (and I promise that I was not driving on the sidewalk at this poor person), when a bus next to me slowed around a corner, and when two vehicles turned right in the right turn lane while I progressed in the right straight lane. I was almost rear ended on two of these occasions because of how abrupt the braking is. Moreover, when an animal ran out in front of me, the system did not activate and I nearly collided with it. It renders the system not only completely useless, but a huge danger and liability. When I took it to the dealership, they told me \"this is normal\" and that the system is \"too sophisticated for its own good\". I want people to understand that the party line has been that these vehicles are operating as intended, so that really makes me questions what these engineers intended and why these engineers are still being allowed to create these inferior-performing vehicles.","727":"Pulled into parking space in a parking lot very slowly.

Mainly notice it when taking a corner. It seems as if it has trouble selecting the gear and once it does, it lurches forward. Dangerous when pulling out into traffic as the hesitation puts you in the middle of the road just a little too long for comfort. Also, my traction control light will come on around certain corners and leaves me without control of the car. Also another safety issue as again the car hesitates or locks up because of this feature and doesn't allow me to drive forward as I wish. It's the middle of the summer without any rain and definitely no snow on the ground (I'd say perfect road conditions) so no real reason why my traction control should be turning on around corners. Very concerned about this issue! also, I should note that these issues have been happening long before 1600 miles. I noticed them the first week or so that I took the vehicle home so definitely less than 500 miles as I bought it new.

After coming to a stop, the vehicle was stranded in place until it was able to start up again many minutes later. Fortunately no one was physically harmed as the individual driving behind our vehicle was observant enough to identify the issue (despite a lack of brake lights or hazards) and stop in time. No visible engine light or fault code was triggered. Less severe problem: On a regular basis, the vehicle suffers abrupt and sustained loss of power in merging situations (especially when turning on city streets from a stop). This seems to be from an overactive or otherwise ineffective traction control system\/programming. Despite even planning for the possible loss of power, this has still resulted in a number of \"near miss\" situations.

Obviously Hyundai will not recall this issue until many deaths are reported as a result of loss of acceleration. Shame on you Hyundai !!!!","741":"Purchased the car new from the dealer. The engine and safety issues can make this car somewhat dangerous to drive.ISSUES:\n- From a complete stop and then turning right uphill, the car stalls\/hesitates during acceleration, can come to a complete stop and can even start rolling backwards during acceleration uphill. Specifically, when turning right and accelerating uphill, the traction control switches on automatically, which can cause a complete loss of torque and also pushes RPM's to well over 6000 while the car is attempting to shift from first to second gear. This creates a dangerous stall situation and also causes the steering and handling to become unpredictable. This could lead to a potentially dangerous safety condition of the car rolling back into another car or over-steering into traffic\/curb.- The \"Eco Mode\" is dangerous. The steering is much too loose during this mode and can lead to over-steering while driving at higher speeds. I've tested this mode extensively and there also appears to be absolutely no fuel savings between it and the standard driving mode. This mode can also cause a complete loss of torque\/acceleration and creates a stall\/hesitation during acceleration from a stop while trying to enter and merge onto freeways. Avoid ever using this mode as it is definitely not worth the risk and is not saving much if any fuel. The Hyundai manual claims the car has \"260 ft lbs of torque\", but this may be an inaccurate claim.- Did not realize that the collision avoidance systems and automatic braking are not standard on the premium trim package for the Ultimate. They are only standard the \"Ultimate Tech Package\". These features are prominently displayed on the Hyundai USA website, but are not featured with the premium package. These safety systems are going to be standard on all new vehicles starting in 2022. Why they did not include these as standard safety features with their premium package is beyond me. Hyundai also indicates that they do not offer a standard safety features upgrade with the premium package, as it is only sold with the \"Ultimate Tech Package\".POSSIBLE SOLUTION?\n- One solution may be to reprogram the computer, so when the car is started, the default is \"Sport\" mode with traction control turned off. Also, the gear ratio from first to second gear is too high\/wide and needs to be set to start shifting at around 4-5000 RPMs from a stop during acceleration (as it should not be going over 6000 RPMs while attempting to shift from 1st to 2nd gear).CONCLUSION\nOverall, I really like the premium features this car offers (panoramic sunroof, push-button start, auto lift-gate, overall driving comfort, etc.), however I'm very disappointed and concerned with this car overall and I feel that Hyundai has not been very receptive to my concerns. I'm taking it to back to the dealer to see if any of these issues can be worked out. A $40k car should not have these issues and I'm also frustrated at the lack of standard safety features, and that this was not disclosed during purchase.","742":"refueling cuts off prior to full tankWhen filling tank, pump clicks off prior to being full.

Merging into traffic), usually turning to the right or left, the vehicle hesitates for what seems to be more that a couple of seconds. The hesitation is enough to cause panic that oncoming traffic will have to stop abruptly to avoid a collision. On one occasion, the vehicle was pulled off the side of the road to get out of the way of traffic because it would not accelerate fast enough. The condition is very worrisome because you never know when it will occur, we can't seem to make it happen on command.

Additionally, we have noticed that the vehicle has a hard time selecting a gear when downshifting while moving at around 30-40 mph. What happens is the transmission seems to stay in a \"float\" condition for an extended period of time and finally will select the gear and accelerate.

It appears that when accelerating from stop, if you drive through a pot hole (it's Spring in Canada so not too hard to find one) the tiny bit of wheel spin triggers the traction control system.  This in turn takes 4-6 seconds to decide to turn itself off.  While doing this, you have very little acceleration capability.  Its quite dangerous in my opinion as you might be pulling into traffic.  I tested this theory at my favourite pot hole outside of work by disengaging the traction control and viola! No problem.

I drove the car home, about 5 minutes from the dealership. All seemed well. The next day, I went on a road trip from Kennesaw to Savannah, GA, which is about 300 miles. The car drove mostly okay. While driving 55+ on the highway, I noticed constantly having to correct the steering wheel as the car wanted to veer left or right. It wasn't horrible just yet. I arrived late night in Savannah, very excited about my new car. It was a fun drive aside from the odd steering that wouldn't stay straight. I parked the car at my mother's house (who lives in Savannah). Savannah is a walking town, so NO need for the car while I was there. I did not drive the car again until Sunday, March 20, when I returned to Atlanta. The first 20 minutes of the trip was about like the drive down from Atlanta. I had to keep the steering wheel in check. VERY ANNOYING. But soon, it started feeling worse, more drastic pulling. I felt like the wind was blowing me around, but it wasn't that at all. Tire pressure was about the same as it was coming down. I checked that several times. I did notice driving down it was 51 psi. Then when I started the trip back, I saw 48psi save one tired at 49psi. Odd. Then 15-20 minutes later into the trip, it was back up to 50 psi on all 4 tires. Odd. Either way, I stayed around 60-65 mph speed limit because the swerving was getting scary. I did about 75-80 on the trip down to Savannah, and about that starting back until the swaying\/swerving got worse. I had my 8 month old baby daughter in the car, so I was stressed the entire 5 hour trip back home, paranoid I would lose control. I was emotionally drained when I got home. I was distraught and depressed after realizing I just bought a gigantic LEMON! And I hardly expect the dealership to do a thing!

I will go in person later today to see if they will do anything to make this right.Update from Mar 30, 2016:The dealership has been working with me beatifully on this. Too bad the Hyundai brand steering is so strange. The swerving issue has not recurred; but the car cannot maintain a straight line without constant correction of the wheel.

If there is slipping going on in the steering column or rack, it could be dangerous, as the vehicle could have difficulty steering, or lose the ability completely when in Drive. Hyundai should figure out what is causing this shudder, and issue a TSB along with a recall to address this complaint which a lot of consumers are reporting.","770":"Driving away from the dealership, after purchasing a 2017 Santa Fe Sport AWD, 2.4 litre, I was pulling out of the entrance and the steering wheel shuddered. Assuming there was a bump or possible grating (due to ice on the roads) I kept driving. When I reached my home, approximately 3 km's away, it shuddered again as I was pulling into my driveway. If it hadn't been Saturday afternoon, I would have brought it back immediately but I still thought it was because it was slippery outside. That was last Saturday. It is now one week and 3 days later and it still shudders, no more ice outside, but it does it over bumps as well, so I will be bringing it back to the dealership to see what they have to say about it.It does not leave a confident feeling when you're driving and your steering starts to shudder for no reason. It almost feels as if the ball joints are so tight and hard as rock that the slightest bump could be causing the shudder.Purchased February 22 and picked up on Saturday, February 25th, 2017.","771":"As I come out of a turn and am letting the wheel return to straight position, and giving it some gas,, the steering wheel shuddered. Not with every turn. Felt it more on gravel roads. I have never had a new car do this. after doing an alignment was done, it was decided to try doing a front end alignment, then replacing the steering column (3 times!). None of these changed it. so they found another car same kind and make for me to test drive, and it did the same thing. So they are saying all the sport models do it. But that does not make it right. It only does it about 3-4 times a day.but the dealership says it nothing. I still have a problem and want to use the lemon law.Update from Oct 16, 2016:Wording of original complaint above is not quite right--The 1st time I took it in for service for this complaint, I was told it was normal. 2nd time, they did an alignment, which was no help. The on 3 separate occasions, a new steering column was installed. Then they got the manager of the service  dept to get involved, and he actually found the same vehicle a Santa Fe SPORT model, and when i drove it, the steering wheel shuddered coming out of a turn just like mine did.  So he surmised that all 2017 Santa Fe Sports so this, so it is ok.  I am not so sure of this, however. No other car I ever drove has done this steering wheel shudder when coming out of a turn.","772":"In the affected vehicle, the wires in the can wiring harness assembly and airbag wiring harness assembly may be damaged by the passenger seat's height adjuster mechanism. A metal 3rd party power inverter was positioned underneath the passenger seat. Prior seat adjustments caused the sheath around the harnesses to become bare, exposing the electrical wiring. The metal power inverter become lodged against the wiring causing a short in the wiring and causing the entire vehicle's electrical system to fail. The epb (electronic parking break) became engaged and it was impossible to drive the vehicle. Although acknowledge that the 3rd party power inverter was under the seat, the vehicle had been driven 4 times with it under it, totaling less than 800 miles. It is not known how long it would take for that box to rub against the sheath on the harness and bare the wiring, therefore it is suspected that the power seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare and that recall #141 safety campaign #16V145000 may not have been properly resolved. We believe the seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare, prior to the inverter being placed under the seat. The inverter was positioned such that it wasn't making contact with the bare wire, until the seat was adjusted on 7\/2\/2017. The car was not driven on 7\/3\/2016. The incident occurred on 7\/4\/216 as the vehicle was driven across railroad tracks. It is believed the inverter was then jarred against the bare wire, causing the short. The dealership has not validated this; they are suggesting it was the inverter that caused the wires to become bare. Our opinion is that the inverter was not there long enough to cause that wiring to become bare. It wasn't until I discovered this previous recall that everything started to make sense. It is a $5,300 repair because the other wires involved that are bare are for the airbags.-Phoenix, AZ, USA","773":"Have been to dealer twice.......keeps happening; screen is off and on all the time!! Apparently their service dept. has no idea what they are doing. I do not have the time to keep returning to dealer every week. I have 300 miles on car and most of those miles is going back and forth to dealer!! I had a good car with only 46,000 miles on it but because of neck problems, I really needed a car with a back up camera to help me navigate. I really regret this auto purchase!!","774":"On the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport during regular driving in daylight conditions, indicators for components such as AWD lock, the parking brake, traction control, and all other indicators using red lighting surrounding the speedometer and tachometer are difficult to see when active potentially leading to unsafe driving conditions or situations where damage to the vehicle may result, as indicated by the owner's manual advising against driving with these features engaged or disengaged.The level of brightness for each indicator appears to be about half of what is required for proper visibility, and adjusting the car's illumination setting does not make any visible changes.","775":"GPS \/ Navigation in this car is useless unless you like to do alot of site seeing. First time I used the GPS navigation in this car I just wanted to try it out and see how it does. It would have taken me 20 minutes to get to a location 10 minutes away. I tried changing settings in it and try it again. Still very scenic. I then tried it going over the border to Road to the Sun in Montana. It wanted me to take a 150 km detour to get there. Thank goodness I didn't get rid of our old Garmin GPS. I will trust that one any day of the week over this unit in the car. Also being a brand new car and old maps in it? Roads that were built 3 years ago still not on the maps in the car? Find it strange they would try to sell this as a feature.","776":"This first occurred within the first week of owning this vehicle. The first time it happened, the entire infotainment system turned off and would not turn back on until I restarted the car. Over the next several months, Pandora would not properly load and I would have to use my actual phone to play music rather than the interface built to do so for me (another safety issue). Twice, when directing the infotainment system to make calls, it would not comply and would idle (the microphone was perfectly operational, as the phone calls I made prior and after this situation were in perfect working order...again, toggled via my phone and not the infotainment system built to accommodate this function. These issues refused to clear until the vehicle was restarted. However, the issue with Pandora happened on almost a daily basis.","777":"something locks up in transmission or drivetrainWhile traveling on the interstate at approx 65\/70 miles per hour, it felt as if I had hit a horse in the road way!My friend riding with me, was looking at her phone at the time, her purse was thrown from the seat against the dash, and she wanted to know what I hit, I told her nothing!She looked in the side review mirror and said, \"you had to have hit something\", I checked all gauges, noticed my traction control lite was on, and a little lite on the left side of the dash, looks like a vehicle going down hill with a cloud over it was also lit. Plus the engine was running much faster, the transmission had down shifted.I pulled over, to inspect the front for damage, there was no damage... I even walked back down the road looking for anything I could have struck, there was nothing there at all. Have no idea what this could have been at this time, it has done it several times since the original incident, once very minor at a very load speed approx 10 mph, the other two incidents was at about 45-55mph.... It will simply scare the crap out of you, it almost feels as if the front wheels are locking up for a split second, my fear is what will happen should this occur on a wet\/Slick road. Vehicle is scheduled for a visit to the dealership on Monday 5\/1\/17, I will heavily document everything said and done!This is a huge concern for me!","778":"When coming to a near stop and then accelerating back to traffic speeds, car may lurch as transmission seems to slip or look for the correct gear.","779":"Purchase New Hyundai Santa Fe Ultimate V6 Aug 17, 2016. Within the first 500 miles the vehicle began to lurch when downshifting at about 40 MPH. I began to write down mileage and condition of weather to see if I could find a pattern. It was random. Switched transmission between ECO, Sport and normal ( it does it randomly in any setting)I called the Hyundai dealer where I purchased the vehicle and service tech reported that they hadn't had any other complaints. When I took it in for the 1st oil change, I reported it again and they said they couldn't find any problems. They did however, \"reset the computer to adjust to my style of driving\"?. I am a 54 year old female, have been driving a 2004 Nissan Murano for the past 10 yrs (bought used). I loved my Murano with its CVT tranny. I knew I would have to adjust to a traditional transmission again but the jolt\/jerk that happens is unbelievable! This is my FIRST NEW CAR PURCHASE EVER! I wish I would have went with the 2016 Honda Pilot.(my 1st choice). It seems every time I call the dealership, they just tell me to bring it in again. We are going in circles. No one has time to have a car in the shop continuously.I have read other complaints about the hesitation on acceleration when between 1 & 2nd gear (and have experienced that a little) but my biggest complaint is the downshifting ( and its always at about 40 MPH) lurch that occurs. I have had several passengers in my car ask me (did you feel that?) when it happened.I will continue to monitor when it happens, and pray that Hyundai will address the issue. Making me wish I would have leased.","780":"The transmission shift pattern on this car at low speeds SUCKS! When slowing down and NOT coming to a complete stop the transmission lugs and struggles to select a gear in Normal and ECO modes. Does not seemquiteas bad in Sport mode.Update from Aug 31, 2016:The transmission shifting on this car was AWFUL when we first got it, particularly from a rolling stop or at slow speeds. I learned a few weeks ago from another CarComplaints.com user that Hyundai released a TSB and software update for the car. Took it to the dealer and had software loaded, shifting now seems perfectly normal.","781":"The vehicle cannot properly shift automatically. When cruise control is activated, the vehicle will stumble and linger in an inappropriate gear, and will takes as long as 15 seconds to either up or downshift, and usually that's due to a complete stop. When cruise control is activated, the same issue occurs, but it has lingered as long as 20 seconds in that state. This happens on a daily basis. When I took it in to the dealership, the mechanic said that it's because the engineers designed the 2017 fleet to idle to \"save gas mileage\". I have it in a report and everything. So to all who are dealing with this issue, it appears that Hyundai did this intentionally and knowingly. And rather than admit this is a huge and dangerous flaw, they are ignoring it similarly to how they ignored the engine problems they had a couple of years back.","782":"in cruise control going downhill it down shifts-- shouldn't do that. my 2013 didn'tin regular without cruise upshifting. doesn't always go to next gear.hesitates when going forward from a standing start.Dealer said it isn't a problem--bullshit!! want it fixed PP","783":"I traded in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata because of the possible engine problems. I guess I should have walked away from Hyundai at that point but instead I took a bath on the Sonata and dropped 30 large on a Santa Fe. We took it to NC the first week we had it. I would set the cruise for 75 mph (so I would not get run over by Semi's) and the car on a slight hill would down shift from 6th to 5th gear for a split second and then drop another gear down to 4th and the rpm would jump to 5500 rpm. It did this every single incline. If the incline was big enough this stupid car would downshift going down the incline as well??I told the dealer when I returned and got the deer in the headlight look. Well I have had this car for 9 months now and at 19,000 miles it is still doing it. I just got back from FLA (I live in Ohio) and this car must have shifted 200 times. It drove me so crazy that if they can not fix it I will have to unload it and this time I am done with Hyundai. I took the car to the dealer after FLA and of course they could not duplicate the problem on the test drive they did re-flash some firmware.I will follow up with this complaint if this did fix the problem. As I told them I do not believe this is a transmission problem because when I take the car out of cruise it never downshifts 2 gears at one time. This has something to do with the cruise control logics and the fact that the car does not have enough horse power for such a big SUV.","784":"Driving with cruise control set at 70 mph. When I approached a slight downgrade in the road the transmission violently downshifted and the engine revved up to 5500. Had to disengage the cruise control for the car to return to normal. Researched on internet and have found several same issues with no satisfaction from Hyundai,","785":"Severe hesitation when trying to accelerate from a stop. Occurs intermittently and happens when turning left or right. More likely to happen if road surface is rough that vehicle is turning onto. The vehicle will begin to accelerate and then lose acceleration. Although pressing the accelerator the vehicle does not speed up even though the engine revs up. After about 3 or 4 seconds the vehicle then responds and begins to accelerate. This situation does not occur all the time. It may happen 3 or 4 times a week. This is a safety concern because I have almost been hit from behind as a result of the vehicle not accelerating.","786":"the car in eco mode or normal mode has no pick up when you accelerate, no pick up at all nearly got ran over by pulling out in traffic, real freakin scary if I find out the recall was out before I bought the car somebody is getting a black eye!!!!","787":"When I make a turn after stopping, the car hesitates, the ESC Indicator Light goes on. This has happened on right turns more often. Can't let my daughter drive car, I feel it's unsafe.","788":"Purchased the vehicle new mid July of 2017. Periodically noticed that there was a hesitation when I tried to get out into traffic. Very brief but long enough to allow oncoming vehicles to get close enough to cause me concern. I inquired at the dealership and they said to keep an eye on it and if it continued, I was to bring it in and have it attended to. Started to pay more attention to it when my wife complained about the same thing. It became progressively worse (especially turning corners and when the vehicle had not been used for a longer period - like overnight) so I had booked a test drive with a technician who was able to replicate the hesitation. I competed the first service on the vehicle early (5736 klms) so they could look at the hesitation issue at the same time they did the service. They said there was no mechanical issue but said the safety feature with the vehicle ie: when the vehicle felt like it would lose traction, the power would be reduced. I said this was a safety issue but mine not the vehicle! When I need power, I need power to get me out of a situation which may cause an accident! I was advised to accelerate more slowly (!) and if it continued, I could bring it back and they would look at it again. I will be bringing it back again - when you pay this much money for a vehicle, you would expect it to power up when you need it to power up. I drove a 2013 Santa Fe 2.0T for 40 months and it was the best vehicle I ever owned - that is why I went back and purchased a 2017 Santa Fe. Hopefully they can find me a fix.","789":"bogs down at low speedsI leased the 2017 Santa Fe Ultimate two months ago. The car is really plush but has a problem of bogging down at slow speeds (1-20 mph) when accelerating, particularly when turning. It seems the transmission is unsure which gear to be in. It is truly dangerous and very disappointing for a car I'll be stuck with for 2 years. The dealer is not close by and I had thought to get it fixed at my first service visit but after reading the comments on this site I have a bad feeling that I will be disappointed by the dealer's response. I had a similar problem with a Chevrolet a few years back (though not as scary as this). It was simply a design flaw on a computerized transmission which they did nothing to correctI'm just curious on how this could be allowed by our federal government. The sometimes minor things that trigger recalls is nothing compared to this design flaw. I've been driving it very defensively while awaiting my service visit and can see the potential for an accident. Please do not consider this car when shopping - you deserve better. Mark","790":"My new Santa Fe 2017 has a problem with the car not reacting to pressing the accelerator. Your press the accelerator and the car does not move and the engine does not rev. The hesitation is about 2 seconds long and is very scary. It happens intermittently and from a stopped position. I'm afraid at some point there will be a terrible accident from this problem. I've had it in to my Hyundai dealership and they can't find the problem. They have suggested I leave the car with them and they hope to be able to duplicate the issue and correct it. I sure hope so!","791":"The car has a hesitation at low speeds causing a delay in acceleration. As another complaint indicated this can be a serious problem which could cause an accident. I have had this happen when turning left at an intersection. I accelerate but the car just sits there before accelerating allowing oncoming traffic to get dangerously close. I've learned to allow extra time in order to avoid this dangerous situation but the problem is intermittent and unpredictable. To be fair, I have not taken it to the dealer yet and found this site when searching to see if others have had this same problem, which at least one other person has reported. I am adding my complaint here so that Hyundai can see that this is a real issue and that they need to address it before someone is seriously injured or killed due to this malfunction in the transmission.","792":"hesitation when down shifting between 10 to 15 mphI have a 2017 Sante Fe Limited Ultimate 3.3 liter motor with the 6 speed transmission that I bought in April, 2016 and at approximately 200 miles I noticed that when driving in the normal mode and, also but not as much in the economy mode, the car has a hesitation when you slow down to between 10 and 15 miles per hour and then accelerate. I've done a little investigating and found that the hesitation is from the car down shifting from 3rd gear to 2nd gear. Now most cars when down shifting will have a very slight interruption in acceleration in some cars you might not even notice but the hesitation in the 2017 Santa Fe is so abrupt that it moves your whole body back and forward. This hesitation can also be dangerous, I approached an intersection and slowed down to between 10 and 15 mph and then tried to accelerate through the intersection the car down shifted from 3rd gear to 2nd gear as it should but the down shift took too long and left me in the intersection for a second or two longer than I should have been making the cars coming from the opposite direction dangerously close. I called the dealership at 200 miles and told them about this problem they told me to continue driving the car because the computer in the car is learning how you drive. I continued to drive the car and at 1000 miles it still had the hesitation so I brought it into the hyundai dealership. As I said this is an intermittent problem and it only happened once during the test drive with the mechanic while he was turning the car. He told me that it might be the traction control. When we got back to the dealership he said no code lights came on so there wasn't much he could do so he reset the computer and told me to continue to drive the car. I shut the traction control off and the hesitation continued so at 2000 miles I took the car to another Hyundai dealership the mechanic test drove the car by himself and he said he didn't see anything wrong I then test drove the car with the service manager and the hesitation only happened once. His response was that this was the way the the car was designed and it seems like I just don't like the way the car shifts and since no code lights came on there wasn't much he could do. I am extremely mad you would think that a car that has a sticker price between 42,000---44,000 dollars would have a flawless transmission cars costing thousands of dollars less have a smoother transmission. Now there is a lot that I like about the 2017 Sante Fe so I'm hoping that this hesitation resolves itself on its own as the car continues to break in or hopefully Hyundai sends out a computer update that fixes the problem I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this issue and I have considered taking a loss and trading the Sante Fe in for a Honda pilot. In the meantime for my safety and the safety of others I really have to watch driving through intersection between 10 and 15 mph."},"title":{"0":"Santa Fe 6-cyl","1":"Santa Fe","2":"Santa
