16,miscellaneous,unknown_or_other,AZ,USA,Dec 02,Dodge,Durango,2017.0,500 miles,"No accident happened yet but I believe one will. This car is equipped with a rotarty transmission selector for drive by wire transmission and has an auto engine stop start feature. This start stop feature can be disabled after the vehicle is started, but cannot be set by default to disable this feature. I understand the fuel saving issue, however but many of us have been driving for many years and we do a lot of things unconsciously because these activities are so common to us. When this feature is activated and you come into your drive way, your garage or a parking space and fully come to a stop, the engine turns off and all goes quiet. Subconsciously because of a lifetime of driving experience, you think the car is off, your travel is over and you are ready to exit the vehicle. You start to open the door and release the brake pedal and the vehicle immediately restarts and moves forward. If a child or someone else or a building wall is it front of the vehicle, a serious accident could happen. Please rethink this. It is not an intuitive process when we have years or decades of a different driving experience. We think the car is off, safe to exit. We need a way to default disable this feature rather than default enable. I know there is an investigation regarding death or injury with regard to the transmission on these vehicles, specifically a claim that vehicle could move with selector put in the park position. I wonder how many accidents were result of drivers thinking the vehicle was off and then it moved. It may be embarrassing and not be admitted to.-Chandler, AZ, USA",Durango,2016
17,accessories-exterior,wind_whistle_from_washer_fluid_hose,J.Regina,Canada,Jan 01,Dodge,Durango,2017.0,Automatic transmission-400 miles,I had a 2014 Durango and it had a wind whistle at highway speed when there was a cross wind or strong head wind. Dealer couldn't figure it out. We took a new Durango from the lot for a drive and it whistled just like mine. I told the dealer there should be a bulletin on it if two of them both whistled. They found out that it was where the washer fluid hose goes over the weather stripping in front of the fire wall. The fix was to move the hose from the built in clip on the underside of the hood to a new location about two inches down to a round hole in the hood. I think it is a drain hole for between the two layers of the hood. They put a loose or floating clip in there to hold the hose. It fixed the problem unless there was a really strong wind and the there was usually a noise coming from somewhere else anyway. The part that is very stupid is that my 2017 is designed exactly the same wayand has the same whistle..You would think the geniuses at Chrysler would have figured It out by now and had a new design for it. Need to get a proper clip for this one to fix the problem. Had lots of other problems with the 2014 but still loved the vehicle so bought another one..

21,lights,exterior_lighting,DC,USA,Nov 28,Jeep,Grand_Cherokee,2017.0,12 miles,"The Jeep Grand Cherokee has a ""safety"" feature called automatic high-beams, a feature they charge an additional fee for. The feature itself can be turned on/off only through the uconnect system of settings, while the vehicle is stopped. The actual feature once turned on can be enabled and disabled through the turn signal stalk (pushing forward to enable, back to disable) once the feature is turned on via uconnect, there is no way to manually turn on your high-beams except by pulling back on the turn signal stalk to enable your flash-to-pass high-beams. This allows the high-beams to turn on for approximately 6 seconds before they automatically turn off, even if you are still holding the stalk back towards you. The reason this is a safety issue is that the uconnect system automatically disables automatic high-beams at speeds of 15mph or less. Once this feature is automatically disabled, it cannot be re-enabled until you hit a speed of 23mph, at this point the automatic high-beams is re-enabled by the uconnect system. Where this becomes an increased safety issue is on residential streets with speed limits of 20mph. There is no way to turn on your high beams on residential roads, unless you are able to turn onto the residential road where the lights were previously automatically enabled (ie driving above 23mph) and you keep your vehicle speed above 15mph. The only way to turn on your high beams in this situation is to do one of the following: 1- break the speed limit to reach 23 mph then drop back down to the legal speed limit (so not an option). 2- drive with 1 hand on the wheel, while holding back the turn-signal stalk to enable flash to pass high-beams, and every 6 seconds resetting the stalk after they turn off. 3- stop your vehicle, enter the uconnect system on the radio, change the settings to turn off the automatic high-beam feature.-Washington, DC, USA",Grand Cherokee,2016

109,engine,loss_of_power_during_acceleration,F.Woodland,US,Apr 01,Hyundai,Santa_Fe,2017.0,"Automatic transmission-1,500 miles","Purchased the car new from the dealer. The engine and safety issues can make this car somewhat dangerous to drive.ISSUES:
- From a complete stop and then turning right uphill, the car stalls/hesitates during acceleration, can come to a complete stop and can even start rolling backwards during acceleration uphill. Specifically, when turning right and accelerating uphill, the traction control switches on automatically, which can cause a complete loss of torque and also pushes RPM's to well over 6000 while the car is attempting to shift from first to second gear. This creates a dangerous stall situation and also causes the steering and handling to become unpredictable. This could lead to a potentially dangerous safety condition of the car rolling back into another car or over-steering into traffic/curb.- The ""Eco Mode"" is dangerous. The steering is much too loose during this mode and can lead to over-steering while driving at higher speeds. I've tested this mode extensively and there also appears to be absolutely no fuel savings between it and the standard driving mode. This mode can also cause a complete loss of torque/acceleration and creates a stall/hesitation during acceleration from a stop while trying to enter and merge onto freeways. Avoid ever using this mode as it is definitely not worth the risk and is not saving much if any fuel. The Hyundai manual claims the car has ""260 ft lbs of torque"", but this may be an inaccurate claim.- Did not realize that the collision avoidance systems and automatic braking are not standard on the premium trim package for the Ultimate. They are only standard the ""Ultimate Tech Package"". These features are prominently displayed on the Hyundai USA website, but are not featured with the premium package. These safety systems are going to be standard on all new vehicles starting in 2022. Why they did not include these as standard safety features with their premium package is beyond me. Hyundai also indicates that they do not offer a standard safety features upgrade with the premium package, as it is only sold with the ""Ultimate Tech Package"".POSSIBLE SOLUTION?
- One solution may be to reprogram the computer, so when the car is started, the default is ""Sport"" mode with traction control turned off. Also, the gear ratio from first to second gear is too high/wide and needs to be set to start shifting at around 4-5000 RPMs from a stop during acceleration (as it should not be going over 6000 RPMs while attempting to shift from 1st to 2nd gear).CONCLUSION
Overall, I really like the premium features this car offers (panoramic sunroof, push-button start, auto lift-gate, overall driving comfort, etc.), however I'm very disappointed and concerned with this car overall and I feel that Hyundai has not been very receptive to my concerns. I'm taking it to back to the dealer to see if any of these issues can be worked out.

This concern was noticed at 200 miles and now it has just under 4000 miles does anyone have this same concern please let me know so I can take this information to the dealer and help their technicians to repair my vehicle and this might help others also.Do we need to go the lemon law way?,Santa Fe Sport 2.4L,2016

Merging into traffic), usually turning to the right or left, the vehicle hesitates for what seems to be more that a couple of seconds. The hesitation is enough to cause panic that oncoming traffic will have to stop abruptly to avoid a collision. On one occasion, the vehicle was pulled off the side of the road to get out of the way of traffic because it would not accelerate fast enough. The condition is very worrisome because you never know when it will occur, we can't seem to make it happen on command. The 3.3L V6 is vey peppy when everything is working right, but you lose confidence in it when these hesitation events occur. Additionally, we have noticed that the vehicle has a hard time selecting a gear when downshifting while moving at around 30-40 mph. What happens is the transmission seems to stay in a ""float"" condition for an extended period of time and finally will select the gear and accelerate. Don't know if the two conditions are related, but both are scary when acceleration doesn't happen when you press the accelerator pedal.

Upon acceleration, the car initially does not respond, then immediately following the hesitation, lurches forward as the transmission finally shifts to a lower gear. This usually occurs at speeds under 10mph.

It appears that when accelerating from stop, if you drive through a pot hole (it's Spring in Canada so not too hard to find one) the tiny bit of wheel spin triggers the traction control system.  This in turn takes 4-6 seconds to decide to turn itself off.  While doing this, you have very little acceleration capability.  Its quite dangerous in my opinion as you might be pulling into traffic.  I tested this theory at my favourite pot hole outside of work by disengaging the traction control and viola! No problem.

I drove the car home, about 5 minutes from the dealership. All seemed well. The next day, I went on a road trip from Kennesaw to Savannah, GA, which is about 300 miles. The car drove mostly okay. While driving 55+ on the highway, I noticed constantly having to correct the steering wheel as the car wanted to veer left or right. It wasn't horrible just yet. I arrived late night in Savannah, very excited about my new car. It was a fun drive aside from the odd steering that wouldn't stay straight. I parked the car at my mother's house (who lives in Savannah). Savannah is a walking town, so NO need for the car while I was there. I did not drive the car again until Sunday, March 20, when I returned to Atlanta. The first 20 minutes of the trip was about like the drive down from Atlanta. I had to keep the steering wheel in check. VERY ANNOYING. But soon, it started feeling worse, more drastic pulling. I felt like the wind was blowing me around, but it wasn't that at all. Tire pressure was about the same as it was coming down. I checked that several times. I did notice driving down it was 51 psi. Then when I started the trip back, I saw 48psi save one tired at 49psi. Odd. Then 15-20 minutes later into the trip, it was back up to 50 psi on all 4 tires. Odd. Either way, I stayed around 60-65 mph speed limit because the swerving was getting scary. I did about 75-80 on the trip down to Savannah, and about that starting back until the swaying/swerving got worse. I had my 8 month old baby daughter in the car, so I was stressed the entire 5 hour trip back home, paranoid I would lose control. I was emotionally drained when I got home. I was distraught and depressed after realizing I just bought a gigantic LEMON! And I hardly expect the dealership to do a thing! This has all just happened, so we will see how HYUNDAI OF KENNESAW decides to HANDLE this one. I will go in person later today to see if they will do anything to make this right.Update from Mar 30, 2016:The dealership has been working with me beatifully on this. Too bad the Hyundai brand steering is so strange. The swerving issue has not recurred; but the car cannot maintain a straight line without constant correction of the wheel.

A metal 3rd party power inverter was positioned underneath the passenger seat. Prior seat adjustments caused the sheath around the harnesses to become bare, exposing the electrical wiring. The metal power inverter become lodged against the wiring causing a short in the wiring and causing the entire vehicle's electrical system to fail. The epb (electronic parking break) became engaged and it was impossible to drive the vehicle. Although acknowledge that the 3rd party power inverter was under the seat, the vehicle had been driven 4 times with it under it, totaling less than 800 miles. It is not known how long it would take for that box to rub against the sheath on the harness and bare the wiring, therefore it is suspected that the power seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare and that recall #141 safety campaign #16V145000 may not have been properly resolved. We believe the seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare, prior to the inverter being placed under the seat. The inverter was positioned such that it wasn't making contact with the bare wire, until the seat was adjusted on 7/2/2017. The car was not driven on 7/3/2016. The incident occurred on 7/4/216 as the vehicle was driven across railroad tracks. It is believed the inverter was then jarred against the bare wire, causing the short. The dealership has not validated this; they are suggesting it was the inverter that caused the wires to become bare. Our opinion is that the inverter was not there long enough to cause that wiring to become bare. It wasn't until I discovered this previous recall that everything started to make sense.

I inquired at the dealership and they said to keep an eye on it and if it continued, I was to bring it in and have it attended to. Started to pay more attention to it when my wife complained about the same thing. It became progressively worse (especially turning corners and when the vehicle had not been used for a longer period - like overnight) so I had booked a test drive with a technician who was able to replicate the hesitation. I competed the first service on the vehicle early (5736 klms) so they could look at the hesitation issue at the same time they did the service. They said there was no mechanical issue but said the safety feature with the vehicle ie: when the vehicle felt like it would lose traction, the power would be reduced. I said this was a safety issue but mine not the vehicle! When I need power, I need power to get me out of a situation which may cause an accident! I was advised to accelerate more slowly (!) and if it continued, I could bring it back and they would look at it again. I will be bringing it back again - when you pay this much money for a vehicle, you would expect it to power up when you need it to power up.

The car is really plush but has a problem of bogging down at slow speeds (1-20 mph) when accelerating, particularly when turning. It seems the transmission is unsure which gear to be in. It is truly dangerous and very disappointing for a car I'll be stuck with for 2 years. The dealer is not close by and I had thought to get it fixed at my first service visit but after reading the comments on this site I have a bad feeling that I will be disappointed by the dealer's response. I had a similar problem with a Chevrolet a few years back (though not as scary as this). It was simply a design flaw on a computerized transmission which they did nothing to correctI'm just curious on how this could be allowed by our federal government. The sometimes minor things that trigger recalls is nothing compared to this design flaw.

160,transmission,hesitation,Island,USA,Apr 20,Hyundai,Santa_Fe,2017.0,Automatic transmission-200 miles,"hesitation when down shifting between 10 to 15 mphI have a 2017 Sante Fe Limited Ultimate 3.3 liter motor with the 6 speed transmission that I bought in April, 2016 and at approximately 200 miles I noticed that when driving in the normal mode and, also but not as much in the economy mode, the car has a hesitation when you slow down to between 10 and 15 miles per hour and then accelerate. I've done a little investigating and found that the hesitation is from the car down shifting from 3rd gear to 2nd gear. Now most cars when down shifting will have a very slight interruption in acceleration in some cars you might not even notice but the hesitation in the 2017 Santa Fe is so abrupt that it moves your whole body back and forward. This hesitation can also be dangerous, I approached an intersection and slowed down to between 10 and 15 mph and then tried to accelerate through the intersection the car down shifted from 3rd gear to 2nd gear as it should but the down shift took too long and left me in the intersection for a second or two longer than I should have been making the cars coming from the opposite direction dangerously close. I called the dealership at 200 miles and told them about this problem they told me to continue driving the car because the computer in the car is learning how you drive. I continued to drive the car and at 1000 miles it still had the hesitation so I brought it into the hyundai dealership. As I said this is an intermittent problem and it only happened once during the test drive with the mechanic while he was turning the car. He told me that it might be the traction control. When we got back to the dealership he said no code lights came on so there wasn't much he could do so he reset the computer and told me to continue to drive the car. I shut the traction control off and the hesitation continued so at 2000 miles I took the car to another Hyundai dealership the mechanic test drove the car by himself and he said he didn't see anything wrong I then test drove the car with the service manager and the hesitation only happened once. His response was that this was the way the the car was designed and it seems like I just don't like the way the car shifts and since no code lights came on there wasn't much he could do. I am extremely mad you would think that a car that has a sticker price between 42,000---44,000 dollars would have a flawless transmission cars costing thousands of dollars less have a smoother transmission. Now there is a lot that I like about the 2017 Sante Fe so I'm hoping that this hesitation resolves itself on its own as the car continues to break in or hopefully Hyundai sends out a computer update that fixes the problem I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this issue and I have considered taking a loss and trading the Sante Fe in for a Honda pilot.

While acc is enabled, say your vehicle comes to fullstop as vehicle in front has come to a full stop(say at traffic signal) and acc applies full brakes. Traffic ahead starts moving again, but since vehicle won't move on its own driver is required to press accelerator to get it moving again or acc to resume its operation (this is by design). In such scenario if driver ends up pushing accelerator a bit harder(I.e. more than just tapping it), acc applies very strong brakes stopping vehicle right there. By this time vehicle behind you has started moving already and might rear-end due to abrupt stop. I guess acc thinks distance between you and vehicle ahead is very less and thinks its going to collide and hence applies strong brakes. But this is a bad design/programming since it expects driver to push acc. Pedal for acc to resume operations, but if driver does it bit more than what acc likes, there is a chance of accident.

This has to be the worst business transaction in my entire life! I regret buying this vehicle, I will do everything in my power to not recommend the 2017 GMC Acadia Denali AWD to anyone! I requested to the GM of Reliable GMC, to cancel the transaction of the purchase. My last option at this point, he stated that the vehicle is repairable and cannot cancel the sale.I am now stuck with a brand new vehicle with 77 miles, which has had major mechanical work done to it! Worst car buying experience of my life as well, I truly hope this compliant hits the desk of the major General Motors person in charge of consumer complaints. I am very upset, as I do feel this issue was per-exsisiting before purchase of vehicle. I would greatly appreciate great attention into this matter.Thank You",Acadia Denali 3.6L V6,2017
180,drivetrain,vibration,S.Mohawk,US,Feb 28,GMC,Acadia,2017.0,Automatic transmission-140 miles,"I picked up my 2017 GMC Acadia on February 28, 2017. This vehicle was a dealer trade because our local dealer didn't have one with the equipment I wanted and in the color I wanted. I test drove an Acadia Denali that the dealer had and was pleased. My salesperson drove to a neighboring state to drive back the Acadia I now have. I live about 20 miles from the dealership. The night I drove it home involved city stop and go driving then about a 12 mile stretch of 4 lane highway before arriving in the small town I live in. Just before I got on the highway I felt a slight vibration in the steering wheel and assumed it was rough road. Once on the highway I felt the vibration again and it felt like I ran over the rumble strips that are on the side of the road and along the center stripe. The vibration faded away. I approached a slow moving car and had to slow down before changing lanes to pass. As I passed the car and got up to 60/61 mph I felt the vibration again. Once again it slowly faded away. This happened 3 more times in that short stretch of highway. This is an AWD equipped Acadia and I was driving it in 2 wheel drive. Now I'm concerned. I told my husband about it when I got home and he said he would drive it the next day to check it out. A couple of days went by and he finally drove it the following Friday and he felt the same thing. He agreed that something isn't right and that we should take it back to the dealer. That day I started googling the situation and have come across many other 2017 Acadia owners with the same problem. The disturbing part is that no one can diagnose the problem, and from what I'm seeing, GM claims it's normal. This is NOT normal! I still have not registered my Acadia because I am finishing out a lease on a Buick Lacrosse that's been a dream car. The Acadia is sitting in my garage, and frankly, I'm hesitant to drive it or register it. It really makes me sick to look at that beautiful vehicle and not know whether the problem can be fixed or not. I called our dealer on Friday and made an appointment to have them take a look at the truck next week. I'm trying to stay calm and give the dealer a chance to diagnose and fix the problem. I thought I did my homework before leasing the Acadia, but I obviously didn't do enough research.Update from Mar 16, 2017:March 16, 2017.  The Acadia has been at my dealer since March 7.  They have replaced the rear transmission mount and the vibration is still there.  They plan to replace the front transmission mount and I fully expect the vibration will still be there.Update from Mar 27, 2017:March 27, 2017.  Upgrading the front and rear transmission mounts has not eliminated the vibration in my Acadia.  My dealer has given all info to GM Technical and they said they are going to send a field engineer to inspect and drive my truck.  I am hoping that the field engineer can figure this out.Update from Jun 2, 2017:My issue has finally been resolved!  I received an email from another Acadia owner with the same problem giving me the number of a service bulletin that fixed the vibration.  The service bulletin is 17-na-168.  It recallibrates the ECM (computer)  I took my truck to my dealer yesterday and an hour later the vibration is gone!  So very happy to report this, and I hope this helps others with the vibration issue.",Acadia SLT-1 3.6L V6,2017
181,drivetrain,vibration,W.Stratford,USA,Oct 20,GMC,Acadia,2017.0,Automatic transmission-5 miles,"This vehicle was a order out of a new model so there was no opportunity to test drive this unit prior to purchase. That said I would counsel anyone one considering the new body style 2017 Acadia with the new 3.6L V6 engine, to do a complete evaluation of the car you are considering for this problem.Here is the issue,.. there is a very audible drumming and vibration felt in the steering wheel and seats when the engine is in the V4 mode in two wheel (FWD) mode when the engine RPM's are between 1500 and 1750. This engine speed unfortunately corresponds to a highway speed of 56 to 63 miles an hour (MPH) and an in town speed of 28-40 MPH depending on the gear (which is precisely where most of my driving occurs). To add insult to the situation we had an occasion in the last few day to require the AWD to be engaged at interstate speed of 70-75 MPH (now with the engine in the V6 mode) and the drumming and vibration was constant, very concerning, annoying and unpleasant and did not cease until the vehicle was stopped and switched to the FWD mode.I have had the vehicle to the GM dealer who is extremely helpful and they confirm the problem, I also drove an identical model on the lot and it has the same issue. GM technical line was consulted and denied knowledge of the issue, suggested re-settling the driveline by loosening running the mounting points, then retighten to specs the motor and transmission mounts along with the exhaust system. This was done and resulted in no improvement, GM was informed and reported back that this was a ""normal operating characteristic"".I again would advise anyone to completely evaluate any 2017 Acadia (new model) with the 3.6L V6 engine for this issue before purchase. In fact with so many other great crossover vehicles available in this class look elsewhere.. consider yourself cautioned.Update from Nov 28, 2016:Now with over 2700 miles on the vehicle I am certain the vibration and drumming occurs at all times.  It just seems to presents itself unacceptably at the times indicated in my initial note. What that means as far as a cause and solution,.. I am not sure but back to the dealer once again this Friday. I will update on the results of that visit.",Acadia SLE 3.6L,2016

Ensured there is minimal road and other noises during Test drive.Bought it and while I was driving home, already could clearly hear some rattle from the 2nd/3rd row seat area.
Damn! this brand new 50K+ car and I started wondering am I really hearing this sound! 
Rattle is noticeable when you are going on a bit bad(note road doesn't have to be very bad or you don't have to go off-road) city roads and at usual city drive speeds. Sound is less noticeable on Freeways at those speeds.
Most of the Rattle seemed to be coming from 2nd row Driver-side seat. And from observations it seems rattle comes when the 2nd row seats vibrates for whatever reason. Some rattle was also probably coming from 3rd row seats when they vibrated.Took it to the dealer and had one of their mechanic come for a test drive. On one of the bad patch, he could instantly hear it and acknowledged the issue. Kept it at servicing center for 2 days. They said the 2nd row seats were making most of the rattle and it was due to lose seat release cables. They secured the loose cables and returned the vehicle. Said they need to order 2nd row seat hand rest/cup holder since that was the one making most sound.Currently waiting for them to get the ordered component and get it replaced. But at this point I can still hear some rattle from 2nd row and now more from passenger side seat. To be honest many a times it seems the rattle is coming from lot of different places like : inside of multiple seats, inside of doors.For car this expensive I would have expected GMC to give me a very luxurious throughly Quality tested vehicle. Hearing rattle from Day1 is a big question mark on Quality Control Department of GMC. Rattle so obvious should have never made it to production. What I am most worried about is, since this is a all-new platform for 2017 year model, hopefully there is no fundamental issue with frame/body integrity which is just getting manifested as rattle at this point. From reading at-least one article(http://www.therecord.com/news-story/6812014-super-glue-helps-automakers-improve-fuel-efficiency/) it seems they are using super glue to hold different parts instead of usual rivets/welds.",Acadia Denali 3.7L V6,2016

When I got to my American Legion Post, I open and closed all of the doors and rear tailgate door/hatch. Had my breakfast and headed home. The dam noise was still there.

Here is more detail on how I know that this is a problem:
1. Internet research: This jerkiness is not typical according to all the forums that I have been in. Since you sent the above email I have spent some time looking into torque converter clutches and signs that these clutches might be going bad. One common issue was that the vehicle will ""shudder"". This happens rather frequently (not as frequently as the single jerk) in my car...it feels like I am hitting multiple speed bumps in short concession.
2. Talking with other Subaru owners: I had a friend with a 2016 Subaru Forester (her second Forester) drive with me while the vehicle was experiencing ""jerky"" behavior. She said that she had not felt anything remotely like the jerkiness that my vehicle exhibits in her own 2016 Forester. I have talked with 4 friends and coworkers that own Subarus, including the one above, about each of the problems that my vehicle is having, including the particular issue that you are referencing in the above email and none of them have been able to relate to any of these issues. 
3. Driving another new Subaru with a CVT: My first 2 day rental from xxx dealership was a 2016 Legacy. I spent a lot of time trying to replicate, with the Legacy, what my vehicle had been doing with no luck. It always transitioned smoothly and I was unable to notice anything remotely similar to ANY (if you look back through the emails and the letter that I wrote you, you will find a myriad of other problems that my car has experienced that have not been addressed) of the problems that my vehicle has experienced. 
4. Told by Subaru dealership that there is a problem: I was told by xxx, xxx Service Manager, that misfire codes had been pulled for the vehicle in question. I had the service foreman tell me that the vehicle was misfiring on multiple occasions. 
5. Told that SOA was sending recommendations to remedy the problem: After the misfire codes were pulled, according to a Subaru representative, the Subaru dealer pulled the engine and were give direction from Subaru of America on how to remedy the problem. Problem being the key word.",Forester Premium 2.5L,2016

268,engine,engine_overheated,Hills,USA,Nov 28,Kia,Sportage,2017.0,"CVT transmission-5,200 miles","Lets begin on November 27 when the engine light came on. NOVEMBER 27, 2016. Today it is December 19. Not only did the engine DIE after only 5200 miles, NOT 52,000, 5200, it was also a brand new 2017 KIA Sportage! If the death of the vehicle wasn't bad enough, we were also given the run around from the start. I usually do not complain and am a very patient person but the way we were treated as far as customer relationship wise, it was a joke and clearly KIA has lost a customer. I can also say, I will from this day forth scream from the top of the highest mountain to NEVER consider a KIA. I understand things happen, cars are machines and they break down, i get it. What is NOT acceptable is when your pile of junk breaks down and you offer NOTHING on your end. After a week, we basically had to BEG for a loaner vehicle. This was after the supervisor of the mechanical department, Chris, told us that the engine was on back order as well as other parts. Again, I understand, what is mind boggling is that he never ONCE offered a loaner vehicle, WE had to ask about it and even then we got the runaround where he had to ask HIS supervisor what he was ""obligated"" to do. We get a vehicle for the next week and a half. The reason it was important for the vehicle is we are a one car family and although I can work from home, my fianc? is a doctor and can't really do that.Jump forward to last Friday, December 16, we get the call to pick up our KIA. AWESOME, IT'S FINALLY FIXED! My fianc? brings it home, we actually head out for dinner that evening to sort of celebrate the return of our vehicle. As I'm driving down the road, I SMELL something that I should not be smelling, sort of like burnt syrup. We stop at a light and I notice white billowing smoke surrounding our vehicle, kind of like an old steam engine if you've ever been on one. Again, another red flag goes up and again I say to myself ""maybe its just something burning off that they repaired."" We enjoy our meal and on the way home I notice that the heat is not working. We live in Michigan and right now its, well, FREEZING. Yep, another alarm bell goes off, SMELL, SMOKE, NO AC... I pretty much know they EFFED up and I had a guess but I am NOT a mechanic but I know the basics. On our drive home the ""ENGINE IS OVER HEATING"" alarm bell goes of. ""ARE YOU F@#$ING KIDDING ME"" I not only say to myself but out loud as well. I pretty much know it has to do with the coolant.The next day its back to the dealership. On the way there it stalls out 3 times, I am glad I was the one driving and not my fianc? and I am also glad my son wasn't in the vehicle either. THAT may have sent me over the edge and a possible fist to the dumb face may have occurred. Again we are given the runaround regarding customer service AND getting a car rental. They know they were keeping it for the weekend and no we did not get a loaner. We could have went and rented a vehicle but they would only be responsible for $25 per day and we would also have to hand in the receipts to see if we would be covered. Again, ""ARE YOU F@#$ING KIDDING ME""!! I thought I may have been having a mental breakdown and hallucinating all of this. Unfortunately I was not! This was all too real. So we drop off the vehicle and luckily Z's mom was able to let us use her car for the weekend. Today we get the call to come and get it, the KIA is all set. YES, the simpletons failed to secure the F@$&ING hose which came off and leaked off of the coolant out which caused the vehicle to do what it did. This wasn't like forgetting to put a gas cap on or something like that. This was an egregious error that could have caused someone to die. If the vehicle would have stalled on the expressway or something like that it could have caused a chain reaction accident and who knows what the outcome could have been. We also are still paying on the lease, insurance as well as the subscription of satellite radio that we purchased when we got the vehicle while it sat in their garage waiting to be repaired.In closing, KIA will NEVER get a good word from me. I am in advertising and word of mouth travels fast. I will also be submitting a complaint to the BBB, the Michigan AG as well as KIA. (I don't even want to start on the ineptness of the KIA ""case manager"" who is about as useful as a cracked brick and about as intelligent. Sorry, bricks.) KIA has lost a customer for life. All of this could have been avoided by SIMPLE basic customer service. I really am an understanding guy but even my patience has a breaking point. We weren't asking for money or anything unreasonable. Just a simple understanding of the situation and commonsense customer care. KIA and their sales and service department are a disappointing joke.",Sportage ES 2.4L Dohc,2016

Annoying or possibly troublesome issue: ""Tire Pressure Monitoring Problem"" indicator warning flashes on the dashboard. It doesn't necessarily indicate a tire pressure problem. The message itself infers the problem is the tire pressure sensor system itself that is problematic. The issue is somewhat subtle so it did not rear its ugly head during a test drive. In fact, I don't think it happens unless there is some sort of distinctive pattern that is executed. However, I was able to trigger the faulty problem just by starting the engine and let it sit idle for a minute or two. I am able to reproduce the issue consistently.I brought the car into service. Service technician was understandable, but the head mechanic was incredulous. I demonstrated the issue and was able to reproduce in front of his eyes. His observation was that I slightly pressed the brakes and released while the car was still going some unknown system check which caused this glitch where the TPMS light went on. What a technical moron!!!! Sorry, perhaps his mechanical skills are okay, but his electronic/computer know-how was severely lacking.I am hoping this is a software bug and a patch update will be available soon. Currently, I have the car in the care of the dealership service center. If they find nothing, I am frustrated enough to call B.S.",CR-V EX 1.5t,2017

When i got home i noticed knocking sound when idle and went back to the dealer. First they said is normal but we tested other 2017 CRV EX and the other CRV was normal (no strange sounds). Then they tried to fix the car 3 times. In 1 week period i went for srvice 3 times and in the end they said that the sound and vibration is maybe from the engine or the cvt or the fuel pump but they don't know where is the reason for that and how to fix it. They called the manufacturer and Honda knows about the problem but they do not have a resolution and no one knows why is that and how to be fixed. They called us to come and pick up the car until Honda finds the problem. I asked them to replace the car with new one but the answer was No. They said that they do not know the reason but the car is safe and we are ok to drive it like that. How is possible to know that the car is safe if you do not know where the sound and the vibration are coming from?? The car has 29 miles on it from the 3 trips to the service department.

I drove it only 3-4 days a week for business and in 3 months on June 14th the Emission System Problem and Check Engine Light came on. I went to the local Honda dealership today on June 15th and have them check the problem. I told them I saw multiple complaints online and what the issue might be. Heard that some problems were fixed when they replaced the fuel filler cap/flap. Well, I waited around 2 hours and they said they performed multiple test and they told me they have no idea what was wrong with it or why it came on. Really?So they turned the Emission System Problem/Engine light off and when I drove back home the Emission System Problem and Check Engine Light came on again. I called another Honda dealership service and made an appointment on Saturday and told them my experience. I don't want them to turn off the Engine light because they can't find the solution. Anyway, I'll go to another dealership on the 16th, hopefully their mechanic will do a better job at fixing my problem rather than telling me, oh we checked, but can't find the problem. If they still can't resolve my issue then I'll go to the one scheduled on Saturday. I know I should probably go to the same dealership and have them check the problem again, rather than go to multiple ones, however having my car checked but came up with no results and telling me there should be no problem is unreliable.Update from Jul 1, 2017:So as I previously mentioned that my Checked Engine Light was still on and the Emission System Problem never got fixed from the first time I went to the dealership on the 15th of June. I decided to visit another one, but I made sure to schedule an appointment because I want them to know beforehand what my problem is, which might make it easier for them to solve. On 6/17/2017, I told the staff there the issue and what happened at the other dealership and they said that will find the problem and help me resolve it. Voila, they found what the problem. They told me that it was a canister change over valve control unit that has a low voltage and was not sending enough electrical current to the module. Well, it's good to know the problem and I have to make another appt because they have to order the parts and have it installed.

We are first time Honda owners and my wife was looking a nonhybrid medium sized suv with a 30mpg average rating. We test drove this car and it seemed to fill both hers and my requirements. Reviews both owners and professional gush with praise on everything I read. we were very impressed ourselves. Then on Monday afternoon my wife gets in the car to drive home and this emissions warning comes on. This is with less than 300 miles on the odometer with almost a half tank of gas of the courtesy tank the dealer put in. Got it back to dealer on Thursday , and in service bay by 11:30 am. Called at 5:45 since I had not heard from them and was told that the tech was in the process of tracing wires and not sure when it would be fixed. So waiting on them and starting to wonder if we should ask for our old 07 Highlander back that had 150,000 miles on it and never had a warning light come on in the ten years we owned it. Drove as good the day we traded it as the first day we bought it. They have gotten a little large for empty nesters like us and the new enlarged CRV seemed like a good fit for us. Hope this decision doesn't come back to bite us on the arse. Will update with the fix if that happens, the service departments tone did not give me a lot of encouragement that it will be quick . Just a feeling.Update from Apr 25, 2017:dealer took car in on Thursday, after several hours of diagnostic testing I was told to leave the vehicle for further testing and was handed a loaner to drive home .  next day was told a part was ordered and would be there the following Wednesday. Thursday received a call that the car was ready for pickup on Friday. have put a tank of fuel through the car and working on a second tank and no warning light yet. so maybe the problem is fixed. wife is getting 31mpg in mixed driving, a big jump from the07 V6 highlander at 20mpg.",CR-V Touring 2wd 1.5t,2017

The cross traffic had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting me. Normally when the engine the re-start delay is small, but because the engine was shutting off as I took my foot off the brake, this added a significant delay before the engine restarted and was able to accelerate.

I would have also noticed the water earlier if I didn't have contoured floor mats.

Does this ultimately require complete replacement of the padding under the carpet and/or the carpet itself? No point in going to that degree if the water leak continues.

The engine revs up to about 4500 (red-line is at 6000), so the engine is definitely going faster, but the transmission just does not respond. 2. There's a delay in the transmission when you select Drive or Reverse from being standing still. You put it in Drive and it takes 2 seconds or so before you can actually drive off !! Same in reverse. 3. The other day I got in, started the car, put it in Reverse and nothing happened. Lights started blinking. Some beeping started happening. But nothing, the car would not go into Reverse. So I put it in Drive just to see and still no response from the tranny. I had to turn the car off and on again before I could engage the tranny.The car seems to be a LEMON. Although ...

Not sure if the issue is with the alignment or with the tires and will provide an update as soon as I have on.What is disconcerting is that this RAV4 is also from Japan (Japan VIN) and it has Yokohama tires and I see that there are already a few complaints about the same issue on 2016 RAV4 XLE models from Japan with Yokohama tires. I purchased a new vehicle hoping for a stress free ride and it is causing me a lot of stress as I am not able to enjoy the vehicle because of this issue.Update from Dec 27, 2016:Update: The dealer did an alignment check and found no issues. They then swapped out the front tires and that seems to have fixed the issue partially. The steering however feels imprecise / vague at highway speeds and in light snow or wintry conditions leading me to think that the Yokohama Geolandar G91 tires (though rated All Season) are terrible tires.",RAV4 XLE AWD,2016
