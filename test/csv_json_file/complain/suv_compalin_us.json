It is going to service tomorrow and I'll update when there is a solution.

I drove multiple 2017 QX60s and a 2016 and confirmed. My son is 60lbs and shakes while sitting in the middle row. I you are the driver, simply reach back with your right hand on the middle row and you will feel the issue. This is also a problem with Pathfinders. Infiniti cut corners and installed a cheap seat. I'm calling you out Infiniti. Please have your engineers contact GM, Honda, or Toyota and copy what they did....because their middle row doesn't shake!!!Warm regards Infiniti.","16":"No accident happened yet but I believe one will. This car is equipped with a rotarty transmission selector for drive by wire transmission and has an auto engine stop start feature. This start stop feature can be disabled after the vehicle is started, but cannot be set by default to disable this feature. I understand the fuel saving issue, however but many of us have been driving for many years and we do a lot of things unconsciously because these activities are so common to us. When this feature is activated and you come into your drive way, your garage or a parking space and fully come to a stop, the engine turns off and all goes quiet. Subconsciously because of a lifetime of driving experience, you think the car is off, your travel is over and you are ready to exit the vehicle. You start to open the door and release the brake pedal and the vehicle immediately restarts and moves forward. If a child or someone else or a building wall is it front of the vehicle, a serious accident could happen. Please rethink this. It is not an intuitive process when we have years or decades of a different driving experience. We think the car is off, safe to exit. We need a way to default disable this feature rather than default enable. I know there is an investigation regarding death or injury with regard to the transmission on these vehicles, specifically a claim that vehicle could move with selector put in the park position. I wonder how many accidents were result of drivers thinking the vehicle was off and then it moved. It may be embarrassing and not be admitted to.-Chandler, AZ, USA","17":"I had a 2014 Durango and it had a wind whistle at highway speed when there was a cross wind or strong head wind. Dealer couldn't figure it out. We took a new Durango from the lot for a drive and it whistled just like mine. I told the dealer there should be a bulletin on it if two of them both whistled. They found out that it was where the washer fluid hose goes over the weather stripping in front of the fire wall. The fix was to move the hose from the built in clip on the underside of the hood to a new location about two inches down to a round hole in the hood. I think it is a drain hole for between the two layers of the hood. They put a loose or floating clip in there to hold the hose. It fixed the problem unless there was a really strong wind and the there was usually a noise coming from somewhere else anyway. The part that is very stupid is that my 2017 is designed exactly the same wayand has the same whistle..You would think the geniuses at Chrysler would have figured It out by now and had a new design for it. Need to get a proper clip for this one to fix the problem. Had lots of other problems with the 2014 but still loved the vehicle so bought another one.. Hope this is in the shop less than the last one","18":"My brand new Durango has been in the shop since I bought it. There was a gash in the upper passenger side door down to the metal and rust began to spread. The lower front bumper was all scratched. The driver side door pillar plastic cover was coming off the top. the wheels hubs are all rusted out. The dealer Carl Burger has been a nightmare. I was promised a loaner but they tried to give me a rental that I had to pay out of pocket.","19":"Brand new from the factory....car delivered missing back cover to passenger seat.

Interior lights remain on even though the lift gate is closed.Update from May 21, 2017:It was the the back window that was open. It opens separately from the tailgate. It has an opener button on the remote and I must have hit it instead of the tailgate itself.I did look look for a way to open the back window from in the car but could not find where that is possible. If anyone knows if there is a way to do that , please let me lknow.","21":"The Jeep Grand Cherokee has a \"safety\" feature called automatic high-beams, a feature they charge an additional fee for. The feature itself can be turned on\/off only through the uconnect system of settings, while the vehicle is stopped. The actual feature once turned on can be enabled and disabled through the turn signal stalk (pushing forward to enable, back to disable) once the feature is turned on via uconnect, there is no way to manually turn on your high-beams except by pulling back on the turn signal stalk to enable your flash-to-pass high-beams. This allows the high-beams to turn on for approximately 6 seconds before they automatically turn off, even if you are still holding the stalk back towards you. The reason this is a safety issue is that the uconnect system automatically disables automatic high-beams at speeds of 15mph or less. Once this feature is automatically disabled, it cannot be re-enabled until you hit a speed of 23mph, at this point the automatic high-beams is re-enabled by the uconnect system. Where this becomes an increased safety issue is on residential streets with speed limits of 20mph. There is no way to turn on your high beams on residential roads, unless you are able to turn onto the residential road where the lights were previously automatically enabled (ie driving above 23mph) and you keep your vehicle speed above 15mph. The only way to turn on your high beams in this situation is to do one of the following: 1- break the speed limit to reach 23 mph then drop back down to the legal speed limit (so not an option). 2- drive with 1 hand on the wheel, while holding back the turn-signal stalk to enable flash to pass high-beams, and every 6 seconds resetting the stalk after they turn off. 3- stop your vehicle, enter the uconnect system on the radio, change the settings to turn off the automatic high-beam feature.-Washington, DC, USA","22":"2017 grand Cherokee Seats - The driver seat in this vehicle is terrible.

Thank you","24":"Bought a brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee with 36 miles on it. We get the miles up to 440 and the engine is already failing. I dropped it off at the dealer with 460 miles. They first told me it was the cams and lifters. Well the V6 engine doesn't have lifters. So then they said it was the tappets. The parts are apparently on backorder so now the vehicle I have had for 15 days is already in the shop for an estimated 10 days with people who don't know the difference between lifters and tappets. I'm hoping this doesn't cause any other problems to the engine seeing as how an important component has already failed causing who knows what other damage.","25":"concerned about other engine damage- not just a simple replacement - how can I be certain that dealer is holding responsibility","26":"Water accumulates in the floor area of drivers side rear seat.

When you open the lift gate, on the left side there are two plastic trim pieces that come together. These two pieces have popped out and will not go back into place. This occurred a few weeks ago when we started to have outdoor temps in the upper 90's. Made the dealership aware of the problem and said they would fix the issue but since the Jeep is currently in the shop for possible transmission replacement, the interior fix is on the back burner.","28":"On August 17, 2016 I purchased a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and within 24 hrs. and only 70 miles on the vehicle it broke down and needed to go back to the dealership with transmission issues. The dealer told me it was the valve body which I researched online and discovered this has been an ongoing issue with Jeep Grand Cherokees since the 2016 model. Some people posted that they had replaced theirs 4 to 5 times within the first year of having the vehicle. Chrysler notified my dealership that the parts were on back order and would not be available until 9\/7\/16. This made me very unhappy as well as nervous that I purchased a \u201clemon\u201d and would continue to have issues with the vehicle for years to come.I requested the dealership to give me a different vehicle being they had another one on the lot in the exact same color and with similar options to the one I originally purchased but was told that decision would need to be made by Chrysler who refused to help in any way. My dealer (Healey Chrysler\/Jeep\/Dodge) went the extra mile for me and found the parts needed to repair my vehicle at another dealership and sent a driver to pick it up the parts and was able to return my vehicle to me on Friday 8\/26\/16 (a week and a day after purchasing the vehicle), if it was not for them I would still not have my vehicle back.I have been working with Chrysler Customer Assistance for some compensation for my aggravation and dissatisfaction with this vehicle, they have the absolute worst customer service ever! For the past week and a half I have been on the phone daily with them trying to get someone to help me and have been transferred on the phone to over a dozen different people that I was told were my \u201cCase Managers\u201d only to leave a voicemail message that were never returned. I spent over an hour a day trying to get some satisfaction with no results. The only thing they were willing to offer me were some free oil changes which does not give me any satisfaction or piece of mind.I am a very dissatisfied customer and will never purchase another Chrysler product even though I am a big fan of the Jeep brand!","29":"My fourth Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited my first major problem ...

The engine warning light came on (Non Blinking) called the dealership and was informed that as long as the engine caution light is not blinking it was safe to drive and also that this sort of thing happens a lot! (Huh). The engine caution light stop (Turned Off)While freeway driving the engine light comes on again (non Blinking) concerned I called in again explained the situation to service supervisor and was told to go ahead make an appointment for the following week (I did). While waiting for the appointment day to come, I was backing out of my garage I was not able to keep the car in reverse as it popped out of gear. Had to turn it off and on, to retry reversing. This happened often that day.I decided to pop into the dealership to have them look at it without an appointment, now they kept the vehicle saying it was a possible valve problem (after a followup and couple days later) I was informed the Transmission needs to be replaced. (What!)After a few days and some research they seems to be a lot of new Jeeps 2017 with transmission problem. For me this is unacceptable so I inquired about the Lemon Law Process for my state and now keeping any and all documents concerning my 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited in the event I need to declare a replacement or repurchase.What irks me if this sort of thing happens a lot, Seems to me they (Dealership) would have a process in place to accommodate on going like problems and be honest to their customers that \"Yes they realize it is going on\" and that they have a fix for this on going event\". All in a timely manner.Disappointed with Jeep","31":"I worked for Chrysler for about 20 years and never thought I would have to be inconvenienced with my jeep grand Cherokee for transmission problems.

I was first told could it be a flash issue and that didn't work and when that didn't work they said they had no more time and had to make another appointment. So I figured it was a wasted trip and I asked if they could diagnose the problem anyways. It was an issue with the transmission. o I I was told to drive my defective transmission and that it was safe to drive. I always thought when you have a down shift on transmission, it would be unsafe to drive. So I waited even though I have a bad transmission. Not sure when Bill Marsh in Kalkaska can fix my transmission. I should have a new transmission, just that simple. We are waiting on star to give guidance. I gave my heart and soul many years to Chrysler, please help if anyone cares. I worked at JNAP SHAP powertrain interior. very surprised.","32":"This is the 4th week in a row I have had to take my BRAND NEW Jeep into the shop for the same issue. The transmission downshifting way too hard. June 5th was the first date. They dealership service department said they fixed the problem and I picked up the Jeep on June 7th. On June 8th I noticed the problem was still occurring, so I scheduled to drop it off the next week. Dropped it off again on Jun 12th and on June 14th I picked up and the dealership service center told me they could not find a problem, but performed the same fix that they did last time. Why fix something if there was no problem found? Well the Jeep was still downshifting hard so I called them and dropped the vehicle off again on June 20th and pick it up on June 22nd and again they say they cannot find a problem. I was going out of town so when I returned I drove up to the dealership on June 27th and drove the shop foreman around and within 5 minutes he felt the hard downshifting that I was talking about (The exact same gears and problem that was occurring when I dropped off on the 3rd time on June 20th). They told me the car would always downshift hard because of the way I drive, knowing damn well that Jeep has has problems with transmissions (recalling 37,000 2016 Grand Cherokee transmissions and the Cherokee having issues with hard downshifting). They told me they would appease me and replace a Value Body to fix the issue. They call me June 28th and tell me they replaced the valve body and it made the problem even worse and they are ordering me a new transmission, but they are back ordered and have no clue when they can get one in. I call them today, June 30th, and they still do not have a ETA for the transmissions. Since June 5th (25 days ago) I have been in a rental car for 12 of those days... and still counting because they have no timeline at this point. AND this is only the main issue among others.. already had a new radio put in, and the new one still messes up (have video evidence). Also, my check engine light has come on twice already. Let me remind you, brand new 2017 Jeep bought in November with 13k miles on it. I traded in a 11 year old 4runner with no problems for a brand new jeep with more car problems than I have had in my 14 years of driving.","33":"Problem upshifting. Had just come off of the freeway, was slowing down at a red light, light changed to green, went to give it more gas in order to accelerate, vehicle appeared to stay in low gear, would not upshift, would barely move. Was concerned about traffic coming up behind me. Put the car into neutral, and back into drive and car returned to normal.","34":"Trans fell out of gear going 10mph in a parking lot and screen read \"put in Park then back into gear.\" It wouldn't go into any gear again, even neutral, and even after a long cooling off period.A flatbed took us to the dealer and I've had a loaner since. After 3 days I was informed the vehicle would need a new trans. It's been 10 days now without further contact So, I'll call tomorrow for an update.I've never had a transmission problem on ANY car in 30 years. What a shame. Everyone seems to say \"I've heard Jeeps have trans. problems now to be avoided.' Chrysler had better handle this aggressively or their brands will absolutely crash.","35":"After stopping, with eco on, the 2017 Jeep will not upshift in drive even though the engine can race up toward 7 RPM. This is with the gas pedal only about 1\/4 of the way down, and even when you let off the gas it does not upshift, instead it uses the engine braking to rapidly slowing down the 2017 Jeep. If someone is coming up on you from behind there could be an accident. Dealer reset the transmission...","36":"The 2017 Sequoia wanders across 2 lanes on flat smooth roads. Does not track straight.

Happens only when first started, engine is cold, 1500 RPM, with transmission in reverse or drive. Noise increases when the steering wheel is turned. The general location of the buzzing is the passenger side just rearward of the front wheel. Waiting for the dealer to diagnose it.","38":"Brakes pedal has a very long travel before engaging. When engaging the pedal is soft. Similar to having air in the lines. Took it back to the dealer. Waiting for a determination.","39":"Seat heaters have controls for the temperature. ON High the seats do not get very warm. I was told by the dealer this can not be changed. That statement is a lie. The heater is controlled by a power transistor that modulates the voltage to the heater using pulse width modulation technology. There may also be a temperature sensor for limiting the maximum temperature. Any of these items can be used to increase the seat temperature. Why pay for heated seats if they do not get warm?","40":"The contact owns a 2017 Cadillac XT5. While driving approximately 20 mph, the driver's seat made a snapping and crackling noise.

No visible engine light or fault code was triggered. Less severe problem: On a regular basis, the vehicle suffers abrupt and sustained loss of power in merging situations (especially when turning on city streets from a stop). This seems to be from an overactive or otherwise ineffective traction control system\/programming. Despite even planning for the possible loss of power, this has still resulted in a number of \"near miss\" situations.

Now, the system is supposed to activate when it senses a vehicle IN FRONT OF it so that it can maintain a safe distance behind it. However, this happened when a person was jogging on the sidewalk next to me (and I promise that I was not driving on the sidewalk at this poor person), when a bus next to me slowed around a corner, and when two vehicles turned right in the right turn lane while I progressed in the right straight lane. I was almost rear ended on two of these occasions because of how abrupt the braking is. Moreover, when an animal ran out in front of me, the system did not activate and I nearly collided with it. It renders the system not only completely useless, but a huge danger and liability. When I took it to the dealership, they told me \"this is normal\" and that the system is \"too sophisticated for its own good\". I want people to understand that the party line has been that these vehicles are operating as intended, so that really makes me questions what these engineers intended and why these engineers are still being allowed to create these inferior-performing vehicles.","95":"Pulled into parking space in a parking lot very slowly.

Mainly notice it when taking a corner. It seems as if it has trouble selecting the gear and once it does, it lurches forward. Dangerous when pulling out into traffic as the hesitation puts you in the middle of the road just a little too long for comfort. Also, my traction control light will come on around certain corners and leaves me without control of the car. Also another safety issue as again the car hesitates or locks up because of this feature and doesn't allow me to drive forward as I wish. It's the middle of the summer without any rain and definitely no snow on the ground (I'd say perfect road conditions) so no real reason why my traction control should be turning on around corners. Very concerned about this issue! also, I should note that these issues have been happening long before 1600 miles. I noticed them the first week or so that I took the vehicle home so definitely less than 500 miles as I bought it new.

Obviously Hyundai will not recall this issue until many deaths are reported as a result of loss of acceleration. Shame on you Hyundai !!!!","109":"Purchased the car new from the dealer. The engine and safety issues can make this car somewhat dangerous to drive.ISSUES:\n- From a complete stop and then turning right uphill, the car stalls\/hesitates during acceleration, can come to a complete stop and can even start rolling backwards during acceleration uphill. Specifically, when turning right and accelerating uphill, the traction control switches on automatically, which can cause a complete loss of torque and also pushes RPM's to well over 6000 while the car is attempting to shift from first to second gear. This creates a dangerous stall situation and also causes the steering and handling to become unpredictable. This could lead to a potentially dangerous safety condition of the car rolling back into another car or over-steering into traffic\/curb.- The \"Eco Mode\" is dangerous. The steering is much too loose during this mode and can lead to over-steering while driving at higher speeds. I've tested this mode extensively and there also appears to be absolutely no fuel savings between it and the standard driving mode. This mode can also cause a complete loss of torque\/acceleration and creates a stall\/hesitation during acceleration from a stop while trying to enter and merge onto freeways. Avoid ever using this mode as it is definitely not worth the risk and is not saving much if any fuel. The Hyundai manual claims the car has \"260 ft lbs of torque\", but this may be an inaccurate claim.- Did not realize that the collision avoidance systems and automatic braking are not standard on the premium trim package for the Ultimate. They are only standard the \"Ultimate Tech Package\". These features are prominently displayed on the Hyundai USA website, but are not featured with the premium package. These safety systems are going to be standard on all new vehicles starting in 2022. Why they did not include these as standard safety features with their premium package is beyond me. Hyundai also indicates that they do not offer a standard safety features upgrade with the premium package, as it is only sold with the \"Ultimate Tech Package\".POSSIBLE SOLUTION?\n- One solution may be to reprogram the computer, so when the car is started, the default is \"Sport\" mode with traction control turned off. Also, the gear ratio from first to second gear is too high\/wide and needs to be set to start shifting at around 4-5000 RPMs from a stop during acceleration (as it should not be going over 6000 RPMs while attempting to shift from 1st to 2nd gear).CONCLUSION\nOverall, I really like the premium features this car offers (panoramic sunroof, push-button start, auto lift-gate, overall driving comfort, etc.), however I'm very disappointed and concerned with this car overall and I feel that Hyundai has not been very receptive to my concerns. I'm taking it to back to the dealer to see if any of these issues can be worked out. A $40k car should not have these issues and I'm also frustrated at the lack of standard safety features, and that this was not disclosed during purchase.","110":"refueling cuts off prior to full tankWhen filling tank, pump clicks off prior to being full.

Good luck to all with same issue.-Staten Island, NY, USA","126":"Hesitation when turning and accelerating from a stop, as you do when pulling out into traffic. Car nearly comes to a stop. Nearly had an accident and I have less than 1000 miles on odometer. Does this intermittently and is bar to recreate at will. Happens mostly in normal mode. Need a recall and fix!!-Gordonsville, VA, USA","127":"The transsmision fails to shift down upon coming to a rolling stop, such as when coming to a stop at a red light, then the light goes green and you accelerate, or turning in an intersection after coming to a near stop, or after traffic slows and you come to a near stop behind a car, then traffic begins to move and you accelerate out of the slow down. Upon acceleration, the car initially does not respond, then immediately following the hesitation, lurches forward as the transmission finally shifts to a lower gear. This usually occurs at speeds under 10mph. The situation is dangerous as the hesitation is not only abrupt, but leaves you hanging precariously, momentarily dead in the water when acceleration is needed in traffic. This problem has been reported to the manufacturer. The manufacturer feels it is a software glitch. The frequency of the problem is increasing, and may eventually lead to an accident. The vehicle performs well otherwise.-Flat Rock, MI, USA","128":"On low speed turns (below 20 mph) the engine and transmission exhibit a loss of power. This jeopardizes my family's safety when turning in traffic. I have opened a case with Hyundai America (#9484960) who left me a voicemail (still have it) stating there is a software update to address the issue I described. I had update #16-01-032 applied on 08\/15\/2016. However, the issue is till present. I also just discovered that when towing a trailer the right turn signal does not work. This is another safety issue. Additionally the lights of the trailer constantly run even when the power is completely off. Lastly the harness where the trailers electrical plugs into on the vehicle, pops out of place when plugging it in. In turn causing me to reseat the vehicles harness each time. I want out of this vehicle but they will not offer me a buy back. I plan to contact a lemon law attorney as I am unable to receive help otherwise.-Charles Town, WV, USA","129":"When accelerating after slowing down to either make a left or right turn car loses power to the engine. It appears that the car is hesitating to accelerate and can be very dangerous when entering the highway. This can be very fatal especially for drivers unaware of this issue. If it presents itself at the wrong time can lead to a very serious accidents with potential fatalities. This has happened since the car was purchased in May 2016 currently car has over 1600 miles (3 months owned). Potential re-flashing of automotive computer is required. Could be part of the traction control system and the cars roll over sensors which can be contributing.

Also find that the slow-down-then-accelerate problem reported by others I have seen as well. +++ dangerous in pulling out into traffic. I had 2012 Santa Fe for 5+ years prior to buying the 2017 and now this vehicle worries me. I am a professional performance driver (paramedic), and I drive a wide variety of vehicles in a wide range of conditions as well as having a vintage Porsche super car. The new 2017 Santa Fe has something wrong with its transmission control system.Update from Apr 16, 2017:Think I may have a handle on the lack of acceleration problem.  It appears that when accelerating from stop, if you drive through a pot hole (it's Spring in Canada so not too hard to find one) the tiny bit of wheel spin triggers the traction control system.  This in turn takes 4-6 seconds to decide to turn itself off.  While doing this, you have very little acceleration capability.  Its quite dangerous in my opinion as you might be pulling into traffic.  I tested this theory at my favourite pot hole outside of work by disengaging the traction control and viola! No problem.  Seems like the traction control is too sensitive, confusing pot holes for slippery roads.","135":"powertrain issue\/acceleration problembrand new santa fe sport 2017 hesitates badly when coming out of turns and attempting to accelerate, just short of coming to a stop.

I drove the car home, about 5 minutes from the dealership. All seemed well. The next day, I went on a road trip from Kennesaw to Savannah, GA, which is about 300 miles. The car drove mostly okay. While driving 55+ on the highway, I noticed constantly having to correct the steering wheel as the car wanted to veer left or right. It wasn't horrible just yet. I arrived late night in Savannah, very excited about my new car. It was a fun drive aside from the odd steering that wouldn't stay straight. I parked the car at my mother's house (who lives in Savannah). Savannah is a walking town, so NO need for the car while I was there. I did not drive the car again until Sunday, March 20, when I returned to Atlanta. The first 20 minutes of the trip was about like the drive down from Atlanta. I had to keep the steering wheel in check. VERY ANNOYING. But soon, it started feeling worse, more drastic pulling. I felt like the wind was blowing me around, but it wasn't that at all. Tire pressure was about the same as it was coming down. I checked that several times. I did notice driving down it was 51 psi. Then when I started the trip back, I saw 48psi save one tired at 49psi. Odd. Then 15-20 minutes later into the trip, it was back up to 50 psi on all 4 tires. Odd. Either way, I stayed around 60-65 mph speed limit because the swerving was getting scary. I did about 75-80 on the trip down to Savannah, and about that starting back until the swaying\/swerving got worse. I had my 8 month old baby daughter in the car, so I was stressed the entire 5 hour trip back home, paranoid I would lose control. I was emotionally drained when I got home. I was distraught and depressed after realizing I just bought a gigantic LEMON! And I hardly expect the dealership to do a thing! This has all just happened, so we will see how HYUNDAI OF KENNESAW decides to HANDLE this one. I will go in person later today to see if they will do anything to make this right.Update from Mar 30, 2016:The dealership has been working with me beatifully on this. Too bad the Hyundai brand steering is so strange. The swerving issue has not recurred; but the car cannot maintain a straight line without constant correction of the wheel. I am getting used to it now; but I would not choose this car or Hyundai brand again. My dealership, though, restored my faith in good business ethics for now. Though they did lose a set of my new car keys. But they are going to replace them.","137":"We bought our 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport used; it had only 11,000 miles on it. Driving home from the dealership, I noticed the steering wheel would shudder and vibrate as the wheel returned to center after a turn. It does not do this all the time, but it suggests there is an issue with the steering column or worse; the steering rack. If there is slipping going on in the steering column or rack, it could be dangerous, as the vehicle could have difficulty steering, or lose the ability completely when in Drive. Hyundai should figure out what is causing this shudder, and issue a TSB along with a recall to address this complaint which a lot of consumers are reporting.","138":"Driving away from the dealership, after purchasing a 2017 Santa Fe Sport AWD, 2.4 litre, I was pulling out of the entrance and the steering wheel shuddered. Assuming there was a bump or possible grating (due to ice on the roads) I kept driving. When I reached my home, approximately 3 km's away, it shuddered again as I was pulling into my driveway. If it hadn't been Saturday afternoon, I would have brought it back immediately but I still thought it was because it was slippery outside. That was last Saturday. It is now one week and 3 days later and it still shudders, no more ice outside, but it does it over bumps as well, so I will be bringing it back to the dealership to see what they have to say about it.It does not leave a confident feeling when you're driving and your steering starts to shudder for no reason. It almost feels as if the ball joints are so tight and hard as rock that the slightest bump could be causing the shudder.Purchased February 22 and picked up on Saturday, February 25th, 2017.","139":"As I come out of a turn and am letting the wheel return to straight position, and giving it some gas,, the steering wheel shuddered. Not with every turn. Felt it more on gravel roads. I have never had a new car do this. after doing an alignment was done, it was decided to try doing a front end alignment, then replacing the steering column (3 times!). None of these changed it. so they found another car same kind and make for me to test drive, and it did the same thing. So they are saying all the sport models do it. But that does not make it right. It only does it about 3-4 times a day.but the dealership says it nothing. I still have a problem and want to use the lemon law.Update from Oct 16, 2016:Wording of original complaint above is not quite right--The 1st time I took it in for service for this complaint, I was told it was normal. 2nd time, they did an alignment, which was no help. The on 3 separate occasions, a new steering column was installed. Then they got the manager of the service  dept to get involved, and he actually found the same vehicle a Santa Fe SPORT model, and when i drove it, the steering wheel shuddered coming out of a turn just like mine did.  So he surmised that all 2017 Santa Fe Sports so this, so it is ok.  I am not so sure of this, however. No other car I ever drove has done this steering wheel shudder when coming out of a turn.","140":"In the affected vehicle, the wires in the can wiring harness assembly and airbag wiring harness assembly may be damaged by the passenger seat's height adjuster mechanism. A metal 3rd party power inverter was positioned underneath the passenger seat. Prior seat adjustments caused the sheath around the harnesses to become bare, exposing the electrical wiring. The metal power inverter become lodged against the wiring causing a short in the wiring and causing the entire vehicle's electrical system to fail. The epb (electronic parking break) became engaged and it was impossible to drive the vehicle. Although acknowledge that the 3rd party power inverter was under the seat, the vehicle had been driven 4 times with it under it, totaling less than 800 miles. It is not known how long it would take for that box to rub against the sheath on the harness and bare the wiring, therefore it is suspected that the power seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare and that recall #141 safety campaign #16V145000 may not have been properly resolved. We believe the seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare, prior to the inverter being placed under the seat. The inverter was positioned such that it wasn't making contact with the bare wire, until the seat was adjusted on 7\/2\/2017. The car was not driven on 7\/3\/2016. The incident occurred on 7\/4\/216 as the vehicle was driven across railroad tracks. It is believed the inverter was then jarred against the bare wire, causing the short. The dealership has not validated this; they are suggesting it was the inverter that caused the wires to become bare. Our opinion is that the inverter was not there long enough to cause that wiring to become bare. It wasn't until I discovered this previous recall that everything started to make sense. It is a $5,300 repair because the other wires involved that are bare are for the airbags.-Phoenix, AZ, USA","141":"Have been to dealer twice.......keeps happening; screen is off and on all the time!!

I tried changing settings in it and try it again. Still very scenic. I then tried it going over the border to Road to the Sun in Montana. It wanted me to take a 150 km detour to get there. Thank goodness I didn't get rid of our old Garmin GPS. I will trust that one any day of the week over this unit in the car. Also being a brand new car and old maps in it? Roads that were built 3 years ago still not on the maps in the car? Find it strange they would try to sell this as a feature.","144":"This first occurred within the first week of owning this vehicle.

Twice, when directing the infotainment system to make calls, it would not comply and would idle (the microphone was perfectly operational, as the phone calls I made prior and after this situation were in perfect working order...again, toggled via my phone and not the infotainment system built to accommodate this function.

Plus the engine was running much faster, the transmission had down shifted.I pulled over, to inspect the front for damage, there was no damage... I even walked back down the road looking for anything I could have struck, there was nothing there at all.

Within the first 500 miles the vehicle began to lurch when downshifting at about 40 MPH. I began to write down mileage and condition of weather to see if I could find a pattern. It was random. Switched transmission between ECO, Sport and normal ( it does it randomly in any setting)I called the Hyundai dealer where I purchased the vehicle and service tech reported that they hadn't had any other complaints. When I took it in for the 1st oil change, I reported it again and they said they couldn't find any problems. They did however, \"reset the computer to adjust to my style of driving\"?. I am a 54 year old female, have been driving a 2004 Nissan Murano for the past 10 yrs (bought used). I loved my Murano with its CVT tranny. I knew I would have to adjust to a traditional transmission again but the jolt\/jerk that happens is unbelievable! This is my FIRST NEW CAR PURCHASE EVER! I wish I would have went with the 2016 Honda Pilot.(my 1st choice). It seems every time I call the dealership, they just tell me to bring it in again. We are going in circles. No one has time to have a car in the shop continuously.I have read other complaints about the hesitation on acceleration when between 1 & 2nd gear (and have experienced that a little) but my biggest complaint is the downshifting ( and its always at about 40 MPH) lurch that occurs. I have had several passengers in my car ask me (did you feel that?) when it happened.I will continue to monitor when it happens, and pray that Hyundai will address the issue. Making me wish I would have leased.","148":"The transmission shift pattern on this car at low speeds SUCKS!

I learned a few weeks ago from another CarComplaints.com user that Hyundai released a TSB and software update for the car. Took it to the dealer and had software loaded, shifting now seems perfectly normal.","149":"The vehicle cannot properly shift automatically. When cruise control is activated, the vehicle will stumble and linger in an inappropriate gear, and will takes as long as 15 seconds to either up or downshift, and usually that's due to a complete stop. When cruise control is activated, the same issue occurs, but it has lingered as long as 20 seconds in that state. This happens on a daily basis. When I took it in to the dealership, the mechanic said that it's because the engineers designed the 2017 fleet to idle to \"save gas mileage\". I have it in a report and everything. So to all who are dealing with this issue, it appears that Hyundai did this intentionally and knowingly. And rather than admit this is a huge and dangerous flaw, they are ignoring it similarly to how they ignored the engine problems they had a couple of years back.","150":"in cruise control going downhill it down shifts-- shouldn't do that. my 2013 didn'tin regular without cruise upshifting. doesn't always go to next gear.hesitates when going forward from a standing start.Dealer said it isn't a problem--bullshit!! want it fixed PP","151":"I traded in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata because of the possible engine problems. I guess I should have walked away from Hyundai at that point but instead I took a bath on the Sonata and dropped 30 large on a Santa Fe. We took it to NC the first week we had it. I would set the cruise for 75 mph (so I would not get run over by Semi's) and the car on a slight hill would down shift from 6th to 5th gear for a split second and then drop another gear down to 4th and the rpm would jump to 5500 rpm. It did this every single incline. If the incline was big enough this stupid car would downshift going down the incline as well??I told the dealer when I returned and got the deer in the headlight look. Well I have had this car for 9 months now and at 19,000 miles it is still doing it. I just got back from FLA (I live in Ohio) and this car must have shifted 200 times. It drove me so crazy that if they can not fix it I will have to unload it and this time I am done with Hyundai. I took the car to the dealer after FLA and of course they could not duplicate the problem on the test drive they did re-flash some firmware.I will follow up with this complaint if this did fix the problem. As I told them I do not believe this is a transmission problem because when I take the car out of cruise it never downshifts 2 gears at one time. This has something to do with the cruise control logics and the fact that the car does not have enough horse power for such a big SUV.","152":"Driving with cruise control set at 70 mph.

After about 3 or 4 seconds the vehicle then responds and begins to accelerate. This situation does not occur all the time. It may happen 3 or 4 times a week.

Periodically noticed that there was a hesitation when I tried to get out into traffic. Very brief but long enough to allow oncoming vehicles to get close enough to cause me concern. I inquired at the dealership and they said to keep an eye on it and if it continued, I was to bring it in and have it attended to. Started to pay more attention to it when my wife complained about the same thing. It became progressively worse (especially turning corners and when the vehicle had not been used for a longer period - like overnight) so I had booked a test drive with a technician who was able to replicate the hesitation. I competed the first service on the vehicle early (5736 klms) so they could look at the hesitation issue at the same time they did the service. They said there was no mechanical issue but said the safety feature with the vehicle ie: when the vehicle felt like it would lose traction, the power would be reduced. I said this was a safety issue but mine not the vehicle! When I need power, I need power to get me out of a situation which may cause an accident! I was advised to accelerate more slowly (!) and if it continued, I could bring it back and they would look at it again. I will be bringing it back again - when you pay this much money for a vehicle, you would expect it to power up when you need it to power up. I drove a 2013 Santa Fe 2.0T for 40 months and it was the best vehicle I ever owned - that is why I went back and purchased a 2017 Santa Fe. Hopefully they can find me a fix.","157":"bogs down at low speedsI leased the 2017 Santa Fe Ultimate two months ago. The car is really plush but has a problem of bogging down at slow speeds (1-20 mph) when accelerating, particularly when turning. It seems the transmission is unsure which gear to be in. It is truly dangerous and very disappointing for a car I'll be stuck with for 2 years. The dealer is not close by and I had thought to get it fixed at my first service visit but after reading the comments on this site I have a bad feeling that I will be disappointed by the dealer's response. I had a similar problem with a Chevrolet a few years back (though not as scary as this). It was simply a design flaw on a computerized transmission which they did nothing to correctI'm just curious on how this could be allowed by our federal government. The sometimes minor things that trigger recalls is nothing compared to this design flaw. I've been driving it very defensively while awaiting my service visit and can see the potential for an accident. Please do not consider this car when shopping - you deserve better.

The hesitation is about 2 seconds long and is very scary. It happens intermittently and from a stopped position. I'm afraid at some point there will be a terrible accident from this problem. I've had it in to my Hyundai dealership and they can't find the problem. They have suggested I leave the car with them and they hope to be able to duplicate the issue and correct it. I sure hope so!","159":"The car has a hesitation at low speeds causing a delay in acceleration. As another complaint indicated this can be a serious problem which could cause an accident. I have had this happen when turning left at an intersection. I accelerate but the car just sits there before accelerating allowing oncoming traffic to get dangerously close. I've learned to allow extra time in order to avoid this dangerous situation but the problem is intermittent and unpredictable. To be fair, I have not taken it to the dealer yet and found this site when searching to see if others have had this same problem, which at least one other person has reported. I am adding my complaint here so that Hyundai can see that this is a real issue and that they need to address it before someone is seriously injured or killed due to this malfunction in the transmission.","160":"hesitation when down shifting between 10 to 15 mphI have a 2017 Sante Fe Limited Ultimate 3.3 liter motor with the 6 speed transmission that I bought in April, 2016 and at approximately 200 miles I noticed that when driving in the normal mode and, also but not as much in the economy mode, the car has a hesitation when you slow down to between 10 and 15 miles per hour and then accelerate. I've done a little investigating and found that the hesitation is from the car down shifting from 3rd gear to 2nd gear. Now most cars when down shifting will have a very slight interruption in acceleration in some cars you might not even notice but the hesitation in the 2017 Santa Fe is so abrupt that it moves your whole body back and forward. This hesitation can also be dangerous, I approached an intersection and slowed down to between 10 and 15 mph and then tried to accelerate through the intersection the car down shifted from 3rd gear to 2nd gear as it should but the down shift took too long and left me in the intersection for a second or two longer than I should have been making the cars coming from the opposite direction dangerously close. I called the dealership at 200 miles and told them about this problem they told me to continue driving the car because the computer in the car is learning how you drive. I continued to drive the car and at 1000 miles it still had the hesitation so I brought it into the hyundai dealership. As I said this is an intermittent problem and it only happened once during the test drive with the mechanic while he was turning the car. He told me that it might be the traction control. When we got back to the dealership he said no code lights came on so there wasn't much he could do so he reset the computer and told me to continue to drive the car. I shut the traction control off and the hesitation continued so at 2000 miles I took the car to another Hyundai dealership the mechanic test drove the car by himself and he said he didn't see anything wrong I then test drove the car with the service manager and the hesitation only happened once. His response was that this was the way the the car was designed and it seems like I just don't like the way the car shifts and since no code lights came on there wasn't much he could do. I am extremely mad you would think that a car that has a sticker price between 42,000---44,000 dollars would have a flawless transmission cars costing thousands of dollars less have a smoother transmission. Now there is a lot that I like about the 2017 Sante Fe so I'm hoping that this hesitation resolves itself on its own as the car continues to break in or hopefully Hyundai sends out a computer update that fixes the problem I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this issue and I have considered taking a loss and trading the Sante Fe in for a Honda pilot. In the meantime for my safety and the safety of others I really have to watch driving through intersection between 10 and 15 mph.","161":"The contact owns a 2017 GMC Acadia.

While acc is enabled, say your vehicle comes to fullstop as vehicle in front has come to a full stop(say at traffic signal) and acc applies full brakes. Traffic ahead starts moving again, but since vehicle won't move on its own driver is required to press accelerator to get it moving again or acc to resume its operation (this is by design). In such scenario if driver ends up pushing accelerator a bit harder(I.e. more than just tapping it), acc applies very strong brakes stopping vehicle right there. By this time vehicle behind you has started moving already and might rear-end due to abrupt stop. I guess acc thinks distance between you and vehicle ahead is very less and thinks its going to collide and hence applies strong brakes. But this is a bad design\/programming since it expects driver to push acc. Pedal for acc to resume operations, but if driver does it bit more than what acc likes, there is a chance of accident. GM should perform more tests with its acc around such scenarios and fine-tune their acc software.-Santa Clara, CA, USA","171":"So here I am 3 months later and I had gone to Rhode Island and drove home. Everything was fine until the next morning. I go again to go run errnads and guess what...MY CAR WILL NOT START!!! I am having the same issues with my truck- Check engine light on....engine will crank but not turn over. However, I had no odor this time. I had the truck towed again to the dealer on Sunday 3\/5\/17 and it is now 4 days later 3\/9\/17 and the dealer called me to say they can't find anything wrong with it. ARE YOU FRIGGING KIDDING ME!!! This is a brand new 2017 GMC Acadia that I should not be having problems with!! I just don't know what to do now. I don't feel safe driving this truck. My heart is in my stomach going to pick up this piece ifsh*ttruck!!!!!This was my complaint for the December incident:I had gone back and forth to Maine to help take care my dying step mom. The truck had low acceleration at times and on my way home on December 10th, I smelled an odor like something burning. I thought it was the car in front of me on highway but when I went to a rest stop on 95S...I realized it was my vehicle. I proceeded to get home...I had an hour left on the road. I made it home!! The next morning, I went to run some errands and the car would not start. The check engine light was on...engine would crank but not start. That smelled started to come back. I called GMC road assistance to have them bring the car into the dealership. After 4 days in the shop they could not find anything wrong as to why this was happening. They asked me a lot of questions. The next day the dealer called and said that the hood latch was causing the vehicle to go into anti-theft mode. Well I believed them and they supposedly fixed the problem I picked up my car a few days later when they were done.","172":"2017 Acadia Denali AWD, when maintaining speed at constant levels, if the engine settles around 1600 RPMs there is a significant shudder vibration feeling and sound - it doesn't matter what speed, just when the engine settles around 1600 RPMs. 20mph, 30, 40, 50, and a bit higher. It seems to be potentially when the V6 converts to run on just 4 cylinders or something, at those RPMs.I'm no technician or engine person. Took to local dealer 4\/10\/17, around 1000 miles on the vehicle total - they confirmed the vibration, since it didn't seem to be normal to me after a few weeks of driving. They said they tested another similar vehicle on lot - same issue.\nSaid to drive it still, for a couple thousand more miles and said that my car would 'learn' and adapt to my drive style. I didn't believe that would happen but did as instructed.A few weeks later, at around 2000 miles total, returned from a 5 hour round trip on non-interstate roads...with close to what I would compare to stress from having ridden in the vibration for pretty much the whole way, constant flat road speeds with the engine settling around 1600 RPMS for most of the trip.Emailed dealer that the vibration is still there, totally ruining my new car experience, and that I hate driving this because of this vibration. I sent the dealer what I found on an Edmunds.com review from an owner - bulletin PIP5488 about the issue. Dealer called me back and said that the bulletin says GM is aware of this condition and it is currently under investigation by their engineering team. Dealer said to check back mid May 2017 to see if solution.In the meantime, I am to keep driving it. UGH! Anyone else having any success in fixing this issue?Update from May 24, 2017:17-NA-168 bulletin was just released to recalibrate the ECM (that is what the dealer said the bulletin does) computer in the car.\nI had mine serviced to apply this 'fix' yesterday.

Bought this New 2017 GMC Acadia Denali AWD on 03\/08\/2017. On 03\/10\/2017 I pulled my New Acadia out of my garage, so I could pull one of my motorcycles out. I then noticed on the garage floor, red fluid on the garage floor. This fluid, was right underneath where the New Acadia was parked. Under the driver side to be precise. Bare in mind this vehicle only has 77 miles on it!!! I could not believe this, I literally just bought this freaking thing! By this time, the service department was closed at Reliable GMC in Roseville, CA.At this point, I had no choice but to wait till first thing Monday morning to take the vehicle in. Here we are two days later, found out my Transfer Case has a bad seal from the factory. Of course, the vehicle is so new they don't have the new seal locally. I still do not have my New Acadia back! This has to be the worst business transaction in my entire life! I regret buying this vehicle, I will do everything in my power to not recommend the 2017 GMC Acadia Denali AWD to anyone! I requested to the GM of Reliable GMC, to cancel the transaction of the purchase. My last option at this point, he stated that the vehicle is repairable and cannot cancel the sale.I am now stuck with a brand new vehicle with 77 miles, which has had major mechanical work done to it! Worst car buying experience of my life as well, I truly hope this compliant hits the desk of the major General Motors person in charge of consumer complaints. I am very upset, as I do feel this issue was per-exsisiting before purchase of vehicle. I would greatly appreciate great attention into this matter.Thank You","180":"I picked up my 2017 GMC Acadia on February 28, 2017. This vehicle was a dealer trade because our local dealer didn't have one with the equipment I wanted and in the color I wanted. I test drove an Acadia Denali that the dealer had and was pleased. My salesperson drove to a neighboring state to drive back the Acadia I now have. I live about 20 miles from the dealership. The night I drove it home involved city stop and go driving then about a 12 mile stretch of 4 lane highway before arriving in the small town I live in. Just before I got on the highway I felt a slight vibration in the steering wheel and assumed it was rough road. Once on the highway I felt the vibration again and it felt like I ran over the rumble strips that are on the side of the road and along the center stripe. The vibration faded away. I approached a slow moving car and had to slow down before changing lanes to pass. As I passed the car and got up to 60\/61 mph I felt the vibration again. Once again it slowly faded away. This happened 3 more times in that short stretch of highway. This is an AWD equipped Acadia and I was driving it in 2 wheel drive. Now I'm concerned. I told my husband about it when I got home and he said he would drive it the next day to check it out. A couple of days went by and he finally drove it the following Friday and he felt the same thing. He agreed that something isn't right and that we should take it back to the dealer. That day I started googling the situation and have come across many other 2017 Acadia owners with the same problem. The disturbing part is that no one can diagnose the problem, and from what I'm seeing, GM claims it's normal. This is NOT normal! I still have not registered my Acadia because I am finishing out a lease on a Buick Lacrosse that's been a dream car. The Acadia is sitting in my garage, and frankly, I'm hesitant to drive it or register it. It really makes me sick to look at that beautiful vehicle and not know whether the problem can be fixed or not. I called our dealer on Friday and made an appointment to have them take a look at the truck next week. I'm trying to stay calm and give the dealer a chance to diagnose and fix the problem. I thought I did my homework before leasing the Acadia, but I obviously didn't do enough research.Update from Mar 16, 2017:March 16, 2017.  The Acadia has been at my dealer since March 7.  They have replaced the rear transmission mount and the vibration is still there.  They plan to replace the front transmission mount and I fully expect the vibration will still be there.Update from Mar 27, 2017:March 27, 2017.  Upgrading the front and rear transmission mounts has not eliminated the vibration in my Acadia.  My dealer has given all info to GM Technical and they said they are going to send a field engineer to inspect and drive my truck.  I am hoping that the field engineer can figure this out.Update from Jun 2, 2017:My issue has finally been resolved!  I received an email from another Acadia owner with the same problem giving me the number of a service bulletin that fixed the vibration.  The service bulletin is 17-na-168.  It recallibrates the ECM (computer)  I took my truck to my dealer yesterday and an hour later the vibration is gone!  So very happy to report this, and I hope this helps others with the vibration issue.","181":"This vehicle was a order out of a new model so there was no opportunity to test drive this unit prior to purchase. That said I would counsel anyone one considering the new body style 2017 Acadia with the new 3.6L V6 engine, to do a complete evaluation of the car you are considering for this problem.Here is the issue,.. there is a very audible drumming and vibration felt in the steering wheel and seats when the engine is in the V4 mode in two wheel (FWD) mode when the engine RPM's are between 1500 and 1750. This engine speed unfortunately corresponds to a highway speed of 56 to 63 miles an hour (MPH) and an in town speed of 28-40 MPH depending on the gear (which is precisely where most of my driving occurs). To add insult to the situation we had an occasion in the last few day to require the AWD to be engaged at interstate speed of 70-75 MPH (now with the engine in the V6 mode) and the drumming and vibration was constant, very concerning, annoying and unpleasant and did not cease until the vehicle was stopped and switched to the FWD mode.I have had the vehicle to the GM dealer who is extremely helpful and they confirm the problem, I also drove an identical model on the lot and it has the same issue. GM technical line was consulted and denied knowledge of the issue, suggested re-settling the driveline by loosening running the mounting points, then retighten to specs the motor and transmission mounts along with the exhaust system. This was done and resulted in no improvement, GM was informed and reported back that this was a \"normal operating characteristic\".I again would advise anyone to completely evaluate any 2017 Acadia (new model) with the 3.6L V6 engine for this issue before purchase. In fact with so many other great crossover vehicles available in this class look elsewhere.. consider yourself cautioned.Update from Nov 28, 2016:Now with over 2700 miles on the vehicle I am certain the vibration and drumming occurs at all times.  It just seems to presents itself unacceptably at the times indicated in my initial note. What that means as far as a cause and solution,.. I am not sure but back to the dealer once again this Friday. I will update on the results of that visit.","182":"There is a very unnerving vibration which occurs at all speeds while trying to maintain constant speed.

Sound is less noticeable on Freeways at those speeds.\nMost of the Rattle seemed to be coming from 2nd row Driver-side seat. And from observations it seems rattle comes when the 2nd row seats vibrates for whatever reason. Some rattle was also probably coming from 3rd row seats when they vibrated.Took it to the dealer and had one of their mechanic come for a test drive. On one of the bad patch, he could instantly hear it and acknowledged the issue. Kept it at servicing center for 2 days. They said the 2nd row seats were making most of the rattle and it was due to lose seat release cables. They secured the loose cables and returned the vehicle. Said they need to order 2nd row seat hand rest\/cup holder since that was the one making most sound.Currently waiting for them to get the ordered component and get it replaced. But at this point I can still hear some rattle from 2nd row and now more from passenger side seat. To be honest many a times it seems the rattle is coming from lot of different places like : inside of multiple seats, inside of doors.For car this expensive I would have expected GMC to give me a very luxurious throughly Quality tested vehicle. Hearing rattle from Day1 is a big question mark on Quality Control Department of GMC. Rattle so obvious should have never made it to production.

But when we started back to denham springs, la, the right taillight started acting up again. I took several videos of the light randomally going off and on on the trip back home with my iphone. I attached video of the light, I edited it to a smaller size and emailed back to the dealership.

The vehicle in front was at least two car lengths ahead of me and there was no collision. The alarm shut off within 20 seconds or so. This was an inaccurate warning and a malfunction of the warning system","222":"On December 19th while driving, my traction control on AND off lights both came on and stayed on as did my ABS light and a warning that my hill descent control was not working. The car went to the dealer and after 7 hours they called and advised that they needed to replace the steering rack??? I let them do their thing, it took over a week to get the rack, they installed it and the problem persisted. When I called the shop they just kept telling me that they were still waiting for a call back from the Ford \"hotline\". They did put me in a Taurus loaner, but I'm paying for an Explorer Sport with winter tires on it, NOT a Taurus with 1\/2 bald winter tires on it for a reason; we get bad weather here and I drive a lot for work. After getting no answers from the dealer I reached out to my company fleet department who then got in touch w\/Ford Fleet and wouldn't you know it, the same day they finally diagnosed the issue. Three days later I had my vehicle back and they said is was the \"gateway control module\" that was replaced. So, after almost three weeks without my brand new car I finally picked it up.It's been approximately 2 weeks and 1k miles later and today all of the same lights came on again, this time accompanied by the \"4 wheel drive not available\" warning and a weird warning coming up on my sync screen that was basically an outline of my car with a red exclamation point in the middle of the top of my vehicle? To say that i'm frustrated would likely be the biggest understatement of the year. Neither the local shop nor the \"experts\" at the Ford \"hotline\" seem to know what they're doing. It's nice to know that they repair vehicles with the same ineptitude that they build them with.....This is why I will NEVER buy a Ford with my own money. Now i'm left with a brand new vehicle that i'm afraid to drive across the street for fear of it breaking down again. Meanwhile, my wife has a 15 year old Honda that i'd feel more secure driving across the country than this POS.Rant over, i'll let you all know how this festering pile of feces pans out.","223":"Exhaust in the cabin is very sickening in my 2017 Exployer and was the same problem in my 2013 Exployer.

A standard come back from sales people when they do not want to admit there is a problem. The 2017 is brand new and Ford does not have an answer for me. There are national news items with police departments complaining and having big issues about this problem!!! Why after four to five years has this not been fixed?????? I paid for the 2013 to have something done about it and FORD would not cover it even under warranty, and the problem still existed. I was not going to keep paying for Ford to keep experimenting at my expense. Guess I thought the problem would not be in the 2017, boy was I wrong.","224":"In the middle day I I fell asleep driving at 35mph.I Think is CO2 but cant prove it.

Had to trade it in after they dragged out the fix until I was stuck with it. Now happening 5 years later. You think they would have fixed the problem by now. And-- of course I asked the dealer if the problem was fixed before buying it and they denied knowing anything about it. If Ford cannot fix it, scrap the entire design and start over.

Took in to two service departments and they could not duplicate the problem. Also contacted Subaru corporate and was told \"there was no problem\". I have Multiple Sclerosis and every time the car jerks it throws off my balance, making me feel dizzy. NOT GOOD! I have now had one dealer agree that it is a problem and they reset the computer.

When accelerating, the car hesitates then stutters\/ jerks and then the engine makes clicking noises. I take my foot off the accelerator and the car sluggishly changes gears. It's occurs more often in lower gears going up a slight hill like a freeway onramp. Subaru agreed to buy back my 2015 Forester and I took a gamble on purchasing the 2017 Subaru Forester XT (thinking there is no way in hell's name I would have the same issue). For the first few weeks the 2017 Forester XT drove fine but right around the 1,000 mile mark it started having the tranmission issue.

At first, car felt great, but after about a week or so of owning, I've noticed that the car would feel like it was slipping or shuddering before it went to the next 'gear'. I first felt it going up a hill and thought it was the wind pushing back on the car, but since then, I've noticed it more frequently, especially in lower 'gear'. My issue is that it seems inconsistent, so if I do bring it in, how is anyone going to recreate it on a short test drive? Also, it seems to happen when I'm not being heavy with the gas pedal or am letting off gas. Anyone else feel this? And suggestions???","249":"I bought my 2017 Forester 2.5i about 6 months ago. I soon started noticing a jerking or shuddering of the CVT transmission at around 20 mph and then again around 60 mph - it also would do this sometimes at other speeds and even while cruising on the interstate. It feels like the CVT belt is slipping or something...I mentioned it to the dealer and was told that others have complained but that there is no fix. I also got a recall notice recently that my vehicle was under a recall due to the CVT fluid being too low due to a manufacturing glitch - I had the recall done and it was found to be a quart low so they fixed that - I hoped this would solve the CVT issue but it did not. The vehicle overall is very well done - handles well, rides smooth, simple controls, great visibility and good cargo room BUT this incredibly annoying CVT behavior completely ruins the driving experience and makes me dread driving it....that should not be the case with a new vehicle. I test drove a CR-V before deciding on the Forester due to the better visibility and the advantage of Subaru's legendary all wheel drive security but the CR-V's CVT was very smooth and felt a lot like a normal transmission. I am so disappointed and hoping Subaru will do the right thing and come up with a reprogramming fix for the CVT - no way this is the way they intended the CVT to perform. If no fix is developed, I won't keep this car long - I want to enjoy driving my vehicle every day and I can't help but think that with the CVT fluid recall issue and the behavior of this CVT, it will be troublesome in the future and probably fail prematurely...","250":"Two days after buying a 2017 Subaru Forester Premium 2.5i started feeling a surging, shuddering\/jerking type feeling when driving.

Has the same feeling of my old GMC fuel pump going out, not quite a transmission or engine miss but a slight jerking.Called the dealership and was told that it's because I am a new Subaru owner and I needed to get use to the CVT engine that it has so I thought about it and gave it another week. Same thing happens every time I drive it. Took it to the dealership 9 days after purchase, the service adviser told me the same thing about being a new Subaru owner, I listened, let her finish and said I hear what you're saying and in another situation it would make perfect sense, but when you're going at a constant speed of 65 you're not shifting gears and it's still jerking so something is going on.They drove it, felt the same thing as I did, put it on the machine and everything came back normal. She called the home office and was told they are aware of the problem but no solution is available at this time. She then again told me that it's because I was a new Subaru drive and I needed to get use to the way it drove. This upset my husband very much. He's been in the automotive\/management business for over 20 year. When there's a problem, there's a problem! So far no one has called me back so I'm basically 30K+ in debt with a car that I love, but is annoying to drive.","251":"I have found many people with this same issue on National Forums. Subaru of America claims this is not a problem. I have spent a lot of time investigating this claim and am certain that it is a problem. I am looking to file a class action against Subaru so that they can no longer claim this as a non-issue and am looking to find people willing to join me in filing the lawsuit. There will be no cost unless we win. Help me put an end to this unethical practice.\nHere is more detail on how I know that this is a problem:\n1. Internet research: This jerkiness is not typical according to all the forums that I have been in. Since you sent the above email I have spent some time looking into torque converter clutches and signs that these clutches might be going bad. One common issue was that the vehicle will \"shudder\". This happens rather frequently (not as frequently as the single jerk) in my car...it feels like I am hitting multiple speed bumps in short concession.\n2. Talking with other Subaru owners: I had a friend with a 2016 Subaru Forester (her second Forester) drive with me while the vehicle was experiencing \"jerky\" behavior. She said that she had not felt anything remotely like the jerkiness that my vehicle exhibits in her own 2016 Forester. I have talked with 4 friends and coworkers that own Subarus, including the one above, about each of the problems that my vehicle is having, including the particular issue that you are referencing in the above email and none of them have been able to relate to any of these issues. \n3. Driving another new Subaru with a CVT: My first 2 day rental from xxx dealership was a 2016 Legacy. I spent a lot of time trying to replicate, with the Legacy, what my vehicle had been doing with no luck. It always transitioned smoothly and I was unable to notice anything remotely similar to ANY (if you look back through the emails and the letter that I wrote you, you will find a myriad of other problems that my car has experienced that have not been addressed) of the problems that my vehicle has experienced. \n4. Told by Subaru dealership that there is a problem: I was told by xxx, xxx Service Manager, that misfire codes had been pulled for the vehicle in question. I had the service foreman tell me that the vehicle was misfiring on multiple occasions. \n5. Told that SOA was sending recommendations to remedy the problem: After the misfire codes were pulled, according to a Subaru representative, the Subaru dealer pulled the engine and were give direction from Subaru of America on how to remedy the problem. Problem being the key word.","252":"The car slightly veered to the left, at first. I brought it up to the sales person during the drive.

This was an ERROR that truly could have cost people their life or at the least great bodily harm. I hope we can get something done regarding Chris and Cody at the Troy KIA dealership in Michigan. They did nothing, or should I say the very least, regarding our situation and customer service. Clearly the actual mechanical problem was also something that was difficult for them to handle.","268":"Lets begin on November 27 when the engine light came on. NOVEMBER 27, 2016. Today it is December 19. Not only did the engine DIE after only 5200 miles, NOT 52,000, 5200, it was also a brand new 2017 KIA Sportage! If the death of the vehicle wasn't bad enough, we were also given the run around from the start. I usually do not complain and am a very patient person but the way we were treated as far as customer relationship wise, it was a joke and clearly KIA has lost a customer. I can also say, I will from this day forth scream from the top of the highest mountain to NEVER consider a KIA. I understand things happen, cars are machines and they break down, i get it. What is NOT acceptable is when your pile of junk breaks down and you offer NOTHING on your end. After a week, we basically had to BEG for a loaner vehicle. This was after the supervisor of the mechanical department, Chris, told us that the engine was on back order as well as other parts. Again, I understand, what is mind boggling is that he never ONCE offered a loaner vehicle, WE had to ask about it and even then we got the runaround where he had to ask HIS supervisor what he was \"obligated\" to do. We get a vehicle for the next week and a half. The reason it was important for the vehicle is we are a one car family and although I can work from home, my fianc\u00e9 is a doctor and can't really do that.Jump forward to last Friday, December 16, we get the call to pick up our KIA. AWESOME, IT'S FINALLY FIXED! My fianc\u00e9 brings it home, we actually head out for dinner that evening to sort of celebrate the return of our vehicle. As I'm driving down the road, I SMELL something that I should not be smelling, sort of like burnt syrup. We stop at a light and I notice white billowing smoke surrounding our vehicle, kind of like an old steam engine if you've ever been on one. Again, another red flag goes up and again I say to myself \"maybe its just something burning off that they repaired.\" We enjoy our meal and on the way home I notice that the heat is not working. We live in Michigan and right now its, well, FREEZING. Yep, another alarm bell goes off, SMELL, SMOKE, NO AC... I pretty much know they EFFED up and I had a guess but I am NOT a mechanic but I know the basics. On our drive home the \"ENGINE IS OVER HEATING\" alarm bell goes of. \"ARE YOU F@#$ING KIDDING ME\" I not only say to myself but out loud as well. I pretty much know it has to do with the coolant.The next day its back to the dealership. On the way there it stalls out 3 times, I am glad I was the one driving and not my fianc\u00e9 and I am also glad my son wasn't in the vehicle either. THAT may have sent me over the edge and a possible fist to the dumb face may have occurred. Again we are given the runaround regarding customer service AND getting a car rental. They know they were keeping it for the weekend and no we did not get a loaner. We could have went and rented a vehicle but they would only be responsible for $25 per day and we would also have to hand in the receipts to see if we would be covered. Again, \"ARE YOU F@#$ING KIDDING ME\"!! I thought I may have been having a mental breakdown and hallucinating all of this. Unfortunately I was not! This was all too real. So we drop off the vehicle and luckily Z's mom was able to let us use her car for the weekend. Today we get the call to come and get it, the KIA is all set. YES, the simpletons failed to secure the F@$&ING hose which came off and leaked off of the coolant out which caused the vehicle to do what it did. This wasn't like forgetting to put a gas cap on or something like that. This was an egregious error that could have caused someone to die. If the vehicle would have stalled on the expressway or something like that it could have caused a chain reaction accident and who knows what the outcome could have been. We also are still paying on the lease, insurance as well as the subscription of satellite radio that we purchased when we got the vehicle while it sat in their garage waiting to be repaired.In closing, KIA will NEVER get a good word from me. I am in advertising and word of mouth travels fast. I will also be submitting a complaint to the BBB, the Michigan AG as well as KIA. (I don't even want to start on the ineptness of the KIA \"case manager\" who is about as useful as a cracked brick and about as intelligent. Sorry, bricks.) KIA has lost a customer for life. All of this could have been avoided by SIMPLE basic customer service. I really am an understanding guy but even my patience has a breaking point. We weren't asking for money or anything unreasonable. Just a simple understanding of the situation and commonsense customer care. KIA and their sales and service department are a disappointing joke.","269":"We just purchased a 2017 Hyundai Tucson sport.

On acceleration from a light, there is very little forward motion. I sometimes have to press the accelerator pedal (with high revs) to the floorboard before I get any normal forward movement. It is as if the car is in the wrong gear or something. It APPEARS that the problem is most noticeable after the vehicle has been sitting in the sun - not sure. It is potentially hazardous when attempting to make a left turn at a light (after coming to a stop). I have to allow extra distance for oncoming traffic so I can complete the turn in time - a little scary & not good. This is my 3rd Tucson. I've had a 2010 and 2013.

Well I didn't even have my 2017 for 2 weeks and I drove 45 minutes to an appointment and when I turned key to shut car off it was stuck in the ignition, it wouldn't click into last position to release the key. This lasted over 40 minutes I tried driving around the block then parked it and again tried taking key out but it wouldn't budge, I even had my hairdresser come out and drive it and same thing happened when she tried taking key out. I finally just cancelled my appointment and drove it to the dealership as I was told they would have to replace the ignition but when I got there I was so upset that now 2nd brand new car I got from them was already giving me problems I yanked on the key and it just came out, so I knew because they didn't see key stuck that I was going to be given the run a round about them not being able to duplicate it so they couldn't fix it and that exactly what I was told the next day when the service department called me. I told them I wanted it replaced as it's under warranty and again I was told that GM doesn't replace anything under warranty. I told them just like my brand new 2015 Terrain that I had no choice but to trade in as I didn't feel safe driving in it with my kids in the car and they wouldn't fix it, they just kept putting it off because problems can't be duplicated while they have it. I told them once warranty runs out and I when it's brought in for same issue that's when they will say that there's a problem and it's going to cost me thousands to fix.

In fact, I don't think it happens unless there is some sort of distinctive pattern that is executed. However, I was able to trigger the faulty problem just by starting the engine and let it sit idle for a minute or two. I am able to reproduce the issue consistently.I brought the car into service. Service technician was understandable, but the head mechanic was incredulous. I demonstrated the issue and was able to reproduce in front of his eyes. His observation was that I slightly pressed the brakes and released while the car was still going some unknown system check which caused this glitch where the TPMS light went on. What a technical moron!!!! Sorry, perhaps his mechanical skills are okay, but his electronic\/computer know-how was severely lacking.I am hoping this is a software bug and a patch update will be available soon.

It accumulates so a huge degree technically inside the vehicle. Exterior car washes cannot access this location and you cannot see it very well without bending down because of the curve of the body.

I went to the local Honda dealership today on June 15th and have them check the problem. I told them I saw multiple complaints online and what the issue might be. Heard that some problems were fixed when they replaced the fuel filler cap\/flap. Well, I waited around 2 hours and they said they performed multiple test and they told me they have no idea what was wrong with it or why it came on. Really?So they turned the Emission System Problem\/Engine light off and when I drove back home the Emission System Problem and Check Engine Light came on again. I called another Honda dealership service and made an appointment on Saturday and told them my experience. I don't want them to turn off the Engine light because they can't find the solution. Anyway, I'll go to another dealership on the 16th, hopefully their mechanic will do a better job at fixing my problem rather than telling me, oh we checked, but can't find the problem. If they still can't resolve my issue then I'll go to the one scheduled on Saturday. I know I should probably go to the same dealership and have them check the problem again, rather than go to multiple ones, however having my car checked but came up with no results and telling me there should be no problem is unreliable.Update from Jul 1, 2017:So as I previously mentioned that my Checked Engine Light was still on and the Emission System Problem never got fixed from the first time I went to the dealership on the 15th of June. I decided to visit another one, but I made sure to schedule an appointment because I want them to know beforehand what my problem is, which might make it easier for them to solve. On 6\/17\/2017, I told the staff there the issue and what happened at the other dealership and they said that will find the problem and help me resolve it. Voila, they found what the problem. They told me that it was a canister change over valve control unit that has a low voltage and was not sending enough electrical current to the module. Well, it's good to know the problem and I have to make another appt because they have to order the parts and have it installed. The parts ordered only take around 3 days but I was busy so I took it to the dealership on the weekend on 6\/24\/2017 to have them replaced the unit and when I drove back home their was no engine light or Emission System Problem that showed back up.","305":"Wife and I take ownership of this crv on a Saturday morning.

Drove as good the day we traded it as the first day we bought it. They have gotten a little large for empty nesters like us and the new enlarged CRV seemed like a good fit for us. Hope this decision doesn't come back to bite us on the arse. Will update with the fix if that happens, the service departments tone did not give me a lot of encouragement that it will be quick . Just a feeling.Update from Apr 25, 2017:dealer took car in on Thursday, after several hours of diagnostic testing I was told to leave the vehicle for further testing and was handed a loaner to drive home .  next day was told a part was ordered and would be there the following Wednesday. Thursday received a call that the car was ready for pickup on Friday. have put a tank of fuel through the car and working on a second tank and no warning light yet. so maybe the problem is fixed. wife is getting 31mpg in mixed driving, a big jump from the07 V6 highlander at 20mpg.","306":"Bought this new car less than 3 weeks ...very upset with engine light indicator came on and showing Error..Emissions System Problem.","307":"I am very upset, less than 2 week old CRV EXL emissions system problem \/ check engine light came on.","308":"Turning the turn signal stick up (right) or down (left) causes a bad \/ spring-like vibration in the steering column.

The labels must immediately be replaced with proper placements from the driver point of view.","314":"After a few hours of owning the 2017 Honda CRV with cloth interior I noticed the seat cushioning and fabric to be way too firm and uncomfortable to bare. I was told they make the seats like this so there is less strain on the seat stiching. I inquired about having the cloth changed out to leather but this option I am told is not yet available. With only being able to tolerate sitting in the car for less than a hour before my behind becomes numb I am considering taking a financial loss and trading it back in. I noticed the leather seems to be more comfortable but once again it really hard to tell with a short test drive before purchasing. I WAS WONDERING IF HONDA WOULD CONSIDER UPGRADING MY SEATING TO LEATHER AT A DICOUNTED COST TO HELP RESOLVE MY ISSUE.","315":"The CLOTH seats in the 2017 Honda CRV are literally a pain in the ass. Be sure you can tolerate the extra firm cushioning. After an hour of sitting you feel like your sitting on concrete. The leather seems to give more. I would recommend if you are considering buying this car to pay close attention to the comfort otherwise your going to be miserable owing a car you can only drive for a short period of time. If you cant handle extreme firm cloth seat cushions run away from this car. I have been told the firmness never goes away the seats are designed to be extra firm so that there is no strain in the stitching. BEWARE!!!!","316":"The seat comfort in the new CR-V is horrible. There is too much padding in the side bolsters of the driver's seat, and the padding is too firm. This pushes into the underside of my leg causing numbness and pain.

Lemon laws may come into play . Now why would Chrysler allow a new jeep to leave the building site to a Dealer knowing this issue and the Dealer knows this as well but does not mention it its called greed and lets screw the consumer .

After nearly two weeks that were able to determine that there was a short inside the TIPM, as well as potentially an issue with the radio\/navigation. Both were replaced and we got the vehicle back, but having a failure this significant basically at the beginning of the vehicles life is unsettling to say the least. We were extra pleased to find out that FCA has a long history of issues with their TIPM's.

Have been turning on fog lights to try to see the road. Jeep says the headlights are not adjustable and there is nothing to be done. I have tried to adjust to the lights, but they are definitely dangerous and the Cherokees are unsafe to drive with these headlights and should be recalled!!! The light from the headlights go off into infinity instead of down onto the road. I am hoping for a recall and will be making a complaint to the Feds and I encourage all other Cherokee owners to do the same thing. These cars are not safe to drive with such horrible headlights.

Just as I started to lift my foot from the brake, the stop\/start feature shut the engine off. There was a full two seconds before the engine started. The cross traffic had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting me. Normally when the engine the re-start delay is small, but because the engine was shutting off as I took my foot off the brake, this added a significant delay before the engine restarted and was able to accelerate.

It appears I have the identical problem in my 2017 Cherokee, thought it may have been related to a recent repair to rear door panel however close inspection of the new weather seals shows it to be something else - if the weather seals leaked I would have heard a whistle.Ido not have a moon roof and simply can't figure out where the water is entering the cabin of the vehicle. I would have also noticed the water earlier if I didn't have contoured floor mats. The collected water appears to be trying to find a way out as a small pool has formed on the pavement below the rocker panel.What's the fix? Does this ultimately require complete replacement of the padding under the carpet and\/or the carpet itself? No point in going to that degree if the water leak continues.

They would have a loaner vehicle for me and would send me a shuttle ride first thing in the morning. I called for the tow truck and was advised by roadside assistance G&S towing had an arrival time of 7:10. At 7:20 PM, the tow truck had still not arrived.

However applying normal power from a standing start where the transmission would up shift through the gears caused a vibration felt in the gas pedal and steering wheel, especially from 2nd gear into third gear.

I've taken the car in already 3 times for the following problems.

The engine revs up to about 4500 (red-line is at 6000), so the engine is definitely going faster, but the transmission just does not respond. 2. There's a delay in the transmission when you select Drive or Reverse from being standing still. You put it in Drive and it takes 2 seconds or so before you can actually drive off !! Same in reverse. 3. The other day I got in, started the car, put it in Reverse and nothing happened. Lights started blinking. Some beeping started happening. But nothing, the car would not go into Reverse. So I put it in Drive just to see and still no response from the tranny. I had to turn the car off and on again before I could engage the tranny.The car seems to be a LEMON. Although ... I've been reading on the web about my car and sure enough tons of people have had the exact same symptoms with their Jeep Cherokees with this transmission.

Frustrating that after 3 visits to the dealership to have this issue resolved, First visit: Let me re flash the system ? (mask the problem). Second visit: We test drove your vehicle and we don't see anything abnormal (in other words we are just used to it or we aren't telling you we don't have a solution) Third visit:I was told this is how this vehicle shifts because it has 9 gears! I was instructed to drive the jeep differently? HUH? Shift manually, wait before taking off to allow it to figure out that I just changed gears!After reading other complaints on this website I see that I'm not alone with the hesitation that I have experienced when shifting in to drive, reverse or driving on the highway, Putting in drive and the jeep rolls backwards till it catches gear almost causing you to roll into another vehicle. The transmission does not seem to do what it should. It down shifts when accelerating before finally deciding to shift to the proper gear. When backing out of a parking space it clunks into gear and jumps after a 2-4 second hesitation. The dealer told me that I have to put into gear and wait before I press the gas, wait until I hear it clunk into gear then proceed to take off! So now I'm the one hesitating, not the Jeep! LOL!! Reprogram how a normal person drives! Rethink how a normal vehicle shifts to allow for these abnormalities that this transmission has! How about they come up with a fix? or would that make too much sense?I have read about previous years of the Cherokee that have had the same issue (lemon Law). 2014 & 2015.

I used to think this was the \"safe\" car for my teenage daughter to drive (out of the three vehicles we own). Not anymore!In addition, the display screen has glitched on me already. Without touching anything, it connected to my phone and made a phone call. It wouldn't let me hang the phone up either on the screen or on my phone. The navigation always takes me a route that's longer than any other navigation i use (not that this is jeeps fault, but worth mentioning). The \"voice\" advising me that I'm speeding tells me the wrong speed limits. It tells me the speed is 45, when it's really 55, and has been that way for years. Very annoying.My last four vehicles have been a Jeep brand vehicles (1 Liberty, 2 Wranglers, and 1 Cherokee). The Cherokee has been nothing but a let-down since the day i purchased it.

Starting up briskly say applying half throttle, the shifts are jerky and sometimes the trans does not shift where it would be expected to do so. I never know if I need half to full power acceleration whether the trans will handle the shifts in a smooth manner. This causes the driver to want to take it very easy when accelerating, yet the V6 engine and 9 speed transmission provide plenty of power for use when needed. I do not expect this type of performance with any car, especially a brand new one.Brought the car in for this problem at about 1,500 miles. The trans software was re installed (this is the second time, the first was for a vibration problem). The service writer said \"we drove the car 10 miles testing it and found no problems.\" So they are apparently used to this type of performance and think nothing of it. In fairness, there was some improvement in the problem, however, it remains.","344":"I bought my Trailhawk Jeep Cherokee in January and after about only driving my car for only a month, as I shifted my gear from park to reverse in my garage my car started going forward instead of reverse.

After struggling with going forward instead of backwards for another time, on the fourth time a notification popped on my screen telling me to shift the gear to park and then shift it back to reverse. But unfortunately this was not the only time that I struggled with my car trying to shift the gear from park to reverse. This problem has happen to me twice to me. Another major problem that I realized my transmission has, is that sometimes, when driving on a freeway, the gear does not shift and I can feel it being stuck and my speed was also stuck and as I pushed more on the gas my speed did not change. My belief is that the Jeep company has not solved its transmission problem and the 9 speed transmission still has some major problems.","345":"I was driving and taking a turn and as I applied the brakes the car did not slow down result in a minor accident.-Anchorage, AK, USA","346":"While driving on cruise control at the posted speed limit of 65 mph, my rav 4 came to an abrupt dead stop with no warning. There was not a car in front of mine, but a car was stopped in a median to my left facing the opposite direction of my car. I could only assume that my rav 4 apparently sensed that car when it came to a sudden dead stop. I had no idea what was happening to my car and thought the engine had shut off. A passenger with me, who is a witness to this event, is an owner of a rav 4 SE without the safety sense\/pre-collision system. We were shook up by this because had there been a car or semi truck trailer behind us, we could have been seriously injured or even killed. I reported this incident to the dealer, Toyota of Warren, where we purchased the new car, and after a day in service, they said the car was working fine with the sensors aligned correctly. I was to let them know if this situation occurred again, and it did. In another incident, again while using the cruise control and with no car in front of mine, a car in the passing lane went by me at approximately 80 mph to my 65 mph. My car came to a dead stop. Thank god there was not a car behind me at the time, or a serious accident could have occurred. After doing research on this safety problem that we experienced, we found a number of reports concerning this very situation happening with their rav 4's coming to sudden stops for no reason.

I've been in cars where both side windows and windshields have been shattered by being struck by something. The sound was completely different this time. It was a POP-bang not a CRASH-bang. The dealer service has passed it up to Toyota Corporate to determine whether they will cover it.

The low beams create a very strange band of light ahead of the car that makes a distinct light\/dark line above the road surface.This dark line in the center of your field of vision makes it very difficult to see clearly at night using the low beams, especially driving downhill on roads that feature a series of ups and downs. On such a downhill, the area of illumination ahead of the car is very short and unsafe, and it is necessary to use the high beams to see the road. This can be a safety issue for oncoming traffic, even if the auto dimming feature is used, because that feature does not always dim the high beams in all situations. In decades of driving, I have never seen such strange low beam headlights. During the car shopping process, most people don't test drive a car at night, but they definitely should in this case.","353":"We recently purchased a 2017 Toyota Rav4 LE. The first time we drove this vehicle at night we were shocked that, when using low or high beams, a dark area appeared across the entire windshield obstructing our vision. It is impossible to drive at night and feel safe. When you go up and down small hills, the darkness moves up and down as well, and is very annoying. We contacted the dealer and they said this was the way the car was made. They would do nothing and,in fact, told us that they didn't own the car anymore and that we should complain to Toyota; that if enough people complained perhaps they would have a recall. Frankly, we are afraid to drive this vehicle at night.","354":"I have been told that it would cost $4000.00 to repair. As a pensioner I don't have that kind of money. Has any one got a cheaper fix?","355":"Car started and was shifted into reverse but slammed into gear. This happened 3 times. On the 4th try it went into gear normally. A week later when going up a hill the 6to 5 shift was very rough as was the 5 to 4. The dealer could find nothing wrong. They tested a new rav4 to confirm?????? Has anyone had this problem?","356":"I bought this car January 5, 2017. Three weeks later, the odometer shows 705 Km and the engine light is on. I have to call towing service to bring the car to the dealership as I was unable to drive it. After diagnosing, they said it can be a transmission issue. They need time to further investigate what happen exactly with the transmission. The dealership will let me know by Monday. I will update my comments by then.I was wondering if someone who owns a new 2017 Toyota RAV 4 has had this same issue. This seems very strange to happen with a brand new car with only 705 Km.!!! I can't wait until Monday to get an update from the dealership. Does anyone have an idea what are my rights in this case? I am feeling very disappointed and I really don't want to keep this car anymore. Thanks in advance.","357":"Bought an RAV4 2017 LE about two weeks ago with 26 miles on the engine. The first-week car drove great no complaints except why I had not purchased a Toyota much sooner.On the second week, I started to notice the steering on the vehicle was pulling to right side at highway speeds (55+) and also at residential speed (25). Right after I started noticing another problem with the steering. At highway speeds, the steering wheel will shake to the point I had to slow down and bring the speed to 50 -. On an older vehicle, I can see why it would happening but on a NEW car. Maybe I would like to spend my money on such major purchase and be worry free but as it seems that will not be the case with this manufacturer.The car will be drop off at the dealer this weekend for a checkup as they have never heard of such issues with this model vehicle. I will come back and update everyone on the results.","358":"I just bought a new 2017 Rav4 XLE with about 52 miles and the steering is pulling to the right. The next day after delivery, I took it to the dealership and they rotated the tires. It was still pulling to the right so I had to go back to dealership and they did an alignment. They told me to they noticed the toe was off. The steering wheel is still going towards the right - slightly. I went on the highway and there's now a slight vibration with accelerated speed...So disappointing! I bought a new vehicle to avoid having to deal with problems and now it has been such an inconvenience and so stressful. Back to the dealership this week...","359":"The vehicle is a brand new 2017 RAV4 XLE AWD that slowly drifts to the right even while driving on the left lane where the road banks left. I took it to the dealer and the tire pressure was fine. I am waiting on the results of the alignment check but am bothered that this is happening on a brand new $27K car. Not sure if the issue is with the alignment or with the tires and will provide an update as soon as I have on.What is disconcerting is that this RAV4 is also from Japan (Japan VIN) and it has Yokohama tires and I see that there are already a few complaints about the same issue on 2016 RAV4 XLE models from Japan with Yokohama tires. I purchased a new vehicle hoping for a stress free ride and it is causing me a lot of stress as I am not able to enjoy the vehicle because of this issue.Update from Dec 27, 2016:Update: The dealer did an alignment check and found no issues. They then swapped out the front tires and that seems to have fixed the issue partially. The steering however feels imprecise \/ vague at highway speeds and in light snow or wintry conditions leading me to think that the Yokohama Geolandar G91 tires (though rated All Season) are terrible tires.","360":"The headlights on this vehicle are terrible. I understand that they are halogen. I have previously owned a 2011 & 2014 Equinox and did not experience this problem. It is dangerous driving at night on country roads. I am forced to continuously drive with the bright headlights on.-North Royalton, OH, USA","361":"I was traveling at approximately 60mph on a highway. The vehicles in the lane next to me were stopped for an obstruction. A vehicle from that lane traveled into my lane right in front of me. I collided with the vehicle - I estimate the collision to have occurred at 30-40mph. None of the airbags deployed.-Warren, MI, USA","362":"whining,rumbling noise when rear windows are openJust to fix it or return it with complete money back.","363":"I was involved in a 5 car pile up on an express way traveling 65 miles per hour and the airbag did not deploy. The car was totaled. I was wearing a seat belt and had multiple contusions and concussions from whiplash.-Lansing, MI, USA","364":"The contact owns a 2017 Ford Escape. While driving 15 mph, the front passenger side door opened without warning. The vehicle was taken to be diagnosed, but was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was 5,124.-Gansevoort, NY, USA","365":"Several times after pulling the exterior door handle to open the door and get in after the car has been parked, the exterior door handle has stuck in the open position, so that when you get inside and try to shut the door, the door does not latch shut and the door is not securely closed though you may think it is.-Brooklyn, NY, USA","366":"So far the story is:I received my car at 4.30pm on the 4th May 2017 , and returned returned the car at 10.30am on Saturday 6th May 2017 (only having done 100klm). It took Ford 3 days to work out that the Catalytic converter was not working correctly. It then took 3 weeks to get the part into Australia (as it is a new model there are not parts in Australia). While my car was in their garage I was given a loan car from Ford (Escape).Then when the original fix date approached (25th May) I was told to meet at Ford and that I would be put into hire car. When I asked what was happening I was told that the turbo was gone, but no one could confirm the full story. Finally the Dealer Principle advised me that the turbo had spat out fine metal shards that had compromised the catalytic converter and that as there are no parts in Australia they would air freight the part in. He then confirmed that the part had a delivery date of the 06\/06\/17. I told them that I would not drive the hire car. They did offer the loan escape back, but I declined. I am currently making do with lifts etc to get to work and around.On the 06\/06\/17 at 4pm, I rang to find out what was happening only to be told that the part had not arrived and should arrive around the 13\/06\/17.Please note that once the part arrives it will still take them a couple of days to repair as I am being told that they will need to drop the subframe to get to the converter and turbo.","367":"The problem was detected by the salesman when we picked up the car and he was showing us the features. He couldn't get the temperature control to work; pulled around to the service dept. They tried to re-boot the computer (yeah, that never works), said they would ordder a replacement part for the computer. Now they said it is on back order! It is cold and snowing here, we really need the heater and defroster NOW. Today they said it would be about 6 weeks!! That is not acceptable. This is a brand new car and we have turned in our other cars, recently deciding to downsize to be a one car family. We have no other car to fall back on. If there is a back order on a brand new 2017 Ford Escape, does that mean all the new Escape Titaniums having a problem?","368":"The brakes on this brand new vehicle are very disappointing. I have driven some late model suv's that were much larger and heavier than an Escape that had far superior braking performance. The Escape takes way too long to come to a complete stop while in traffic. Very unsafe!!!!!","369":"Took to service and was told normal. Backing up the brakes squeal since I purchased and still does. I purchased the car June 24, 2016 and this is April 3,2017 still does this and I'm told it is normal. I do not believe this.","370":"Purchased a new 2017 Ford Escape in August; in November the rear brakes started to squeak off-and-on when I back up. Called the dealership - was told it is normal, nothing we can do. Took the vehicle in to the dealership on January 25, 2017 because I was still dealing with the squeaking, again I was told - there is nothing we can do, this is normal, all Fords 2016 & 2017 do it. The problem is still going on and it is March 1, 2017. I called the dealership again today and again I was told that there is nothing that they can do. I do know there is a service bulletin out on 2106 & 2017 about the brakes, but the service guy assured me that it does not pertain to my vehicle and my squeaky brakes are NORMAL, I told him that I don't know who he thinks he is but squeaky brakes are not NORMAL. I did not spend and have a huge loan on a brand new vehicle to have it squeak.","371":"Unintended acceleration when parking at slow speed with eco on. Often seen into garage which is slight incline. Automobile stops moving and any touch of the accelerator causes fast surge requiring very quick braking. Very repeatable under slow conditions. Selling dealer checked vehicle and reported that system operating as designed when auto stop\/start is activated. This design is dangerous and the system should not default to engine auto stop activated.-Apollo Beach, FL, USA","372":"We were going to the movies as a family when even the kids said what's that smell?  A fairly strong oil smell was coming from the engine compartment. It was not as noticeable when cold but after warm up present after accelerating it was stronger. It is pretty consistent but milder during cruise.Update from Mar 11, 2017:I recently took the vehicle in for the oil smell,it got more consistent and a Ford Master Mechanic at Wickstrom Ford found that a turbo charger vent line was never connected at the factory causing not only the smell but also the puffing sounds coming from the engine compartment.The service advisor said it would take a little time to burn off the solvents and remaining oil.The noise coming from the engine compartment has been dramatically reduced.","373":"fairly loud woosh after letting up on the acceleratorI feel that this issue should have been addressed during R&D of the product.In a sports car young people like to hear the release from the waste gate it's part of the power thing.In a family SUV not so much.My wife is very annoyed by the cycling heard from the air being vented under the hood.Why wasn't a recirculation valve installed to minimize or eliminate the air release sound?Love the vehicle and it has good power but not thought through.Ford should put out a service bulletin to address this issue.Update from Mar 11, 2017:As stated in the oil smell complaint once the turbo charger vent was connected the noise has been reduced.Waiting now to see if oil smell gone completely after vent installed.","374":"This has been an intermittent problem since I picked up the car 3 weeks ago. Fortunately I have a dealer who takes good care of me.","375":"The 1.5L Eco Boost engine in the Escape is under powered. This engine is too small and under powered for the weight of the Escape. Trying to get up to speed and merging into traffic from a stop takes way too long and is unsafe. I am surprised that this engine with such a poor power to weight ratio was allowed into the Escape.","376":"unsupportive driver seatThe driver's leather seat in the Escape is terrible. It is very unsupportive and droops down the closer one gets to the driver's door. I have seen this flaw on multiple Escape's. It is lacking adequate padding and is too small in general. The bottom portion of the seat that supports the driver's legs also doesn't extend out far enough. My legs are hanging down and my butt and back are leaning to my left. My body is sore after driving the Escape. This seat appears to be a product of extreme cost cutting.","377":"The panel for all information went blank. I took it to the dealer and it started working before I got there and they could not fix it. Have to see it to fix it.","378":"I noticed my glove compartment was crooked and a big space was by the door. Took to the service department and had it repaired and it looks the same as it did when I had it repaired. Take it back today. 04\/03\/2017Etta Robbins, Dayton,TX US","379":"tiny interior door handles and power window buttonsThe interior door handles and power window buttons are ridiculously tiny on the Escape. They are both way too small and difficult to use. They would be acceptable on a Fiesta but not even a Focus! Again, way too much cost cutting Ford.","380":"broken universal garage door openerThe universal garage door opener buttons integrated into the driver side sun visor never worked and was broken from day one. I must of tried around 50 times using various programming methods to program the garage door opener buttons in this vehicle to no avail. We even continuously pressed the learn button on the garage door motor as well. We finally took it in to the service department and reported the problem of how this feature failed to work despite following all the instructions listed in the owner's manual. He told us to keep trying some more and this time to back in the vehicle up the driveway. We questioned him as to why our other vehicle never had this problem. We completely followed his advice and tried around 30 more times to program the universal garage door opener to no avail. In the midst of having to do all this and being outside for an extended and abnormal amount of time during the winter, I landed up catching a cold. My face was in great discomfort from my severely dry skin that resulted from my runny nose. On the second visit they FINALLY agreed to replace the defective part with a new unit, which landed up working properly. FORD; your QUALITY SUCKS, and your SERVICE SUCKS too!!!!!","381":"fog lights unavailable. headlights dangerous in dense fogVery dangerous to drive in foggy conditions. Called parts department at dealership. Was told that there was no fog light kit available.,","382":"no option for fog lights. headlights awful in fogCalled Parts department at dealership and told nothing was available for fog lights. Driving in fog was life threatening!!!!!!","383":"When OnStar mirror is dimmed at night the location of the manual lever causes you to activate OnStar which is MOST distracting!!!!!!","384":"Everytime I go to manually dim the mirror, I hit the OnStar emergency call button. Soooooooo distracting. I'm sure it'll cause an accident. Senior citizens are given no consideration in these matters","385":"Brought vehicle to dealership. They brought it inside warm garage and cleared ice and snow blockage. Wipers impact hood and can not be lifted up in air where they can shed freezing rain, ice and snow while parked. Makes for a very hazardous driving situation. Poor design!!!!!!!","386":"mobile app does not remote start engine and warm carI was specifically told by salesman that I could remote start the vehicle with the OnStar app. Not true. That only works if remote start is built into the car. So much for truth in this day and age!!!!! Parts manager at this dealership says that there is no GM remote starter that can be installed. Again another affront to a senior citizen!","387":"The problem:I switch on the engine first thing I hear is the beeping of the parking sensor (front) and the visual indication on the display, then the light on the park sensor switch starts flashing and goes on (so park sensor is now on OFF position). Later during the day the problem disappears and the sensor is ON again, but randomly appears again and again, so at the end I decide to switch off the parking sensor for good.This is the car that I have received in substitution of my Renegade same year same model same color, my car problem was a sudden loss of engine power on the highway three times in one day (I will report separately).Ironically I have got a brand new Renegade as a temporary replacement during the service time (one week still not passed).","388":"Received a tiny chip in windshield from highway. I was going to take it to repair to have the liquid injected into area the next morning but when I came out the next day there was a six inch crack line extended from the chip. This had to have happened while the car was sitting in the garage overnight. But the worst part is the back order on the windshields and the EXTREME high costs. Makes me think I made a mistake on buying a jeep.","389":"My driver door window shattered after I jet washed it. It is only 6 months old for crying out loud!! I was in shock and other people present couldn't understand how this happened. Thank goodness I wasn't driving, or I could've been involved in an accident and injured myself and\/or others!! Serious stuff. What was even more annoying was that after taking it to Jeep they came back saying that as the door mechanism worked OK the warranty would not cover the cost of the repairs!! Unbelievable! So, once I get it replaced and door resprayed (as there are scratches from the shattered glass) at my own expense..!! how do I ever take my Jeep Renegade back to the car wash without being scared to death one of my car windows\/windshield will explode !!VERY POOR SHOW Jeep !! Not only have you not honored the pathetic warranty you offer, but you are placing customers who have put their trust in you in danger, and you don't care one bit. What kind of low quality tempered glass are you using for these cars?? I still have some of the pieces of the glass and I am taking it to a lab for testing. Also will be going to the Consumer Rights and placing a formal complaint to Jeep.I have a friend who had a problem with their Jeep car radio and it was replaced under warranty...the radio cost nearly \u00a32000 pounds sterling. A door window is just a fraction of that, and much higher in the safety importance scale! And Jeep will not foot the bill under warraty?? Just goes to show what little value Jeep places on their customers....?!!","390":"After being told in Monahans, TX that the car was \"good \" we drove 124 miles until we stalled out in the middle of the desert,107 degrees. Not wanting to be on the side of the road in the heat we waited a few minutes, start the car back up and drive less than a mile before it shut down again. We called for a tow and was told it would be 2 hours before a tow truck could get to us. I told dispatch we would be passed out from the heat by then. She contacted local sheriff. He found us next to a dead deer 6 miles from his town. An ambulance came to bring us COLD water they hung around for awhile and then we started the car back up and he followed us into the town to a fast food restaurant where we could park and get out of the heat, in the meantime the sheriff got hold of the tow co and they were there in an hour instead of 2. We were then towed 30 miles to SAN Angelo TX and after 2 days were told that we needed a new transmission that had to be ordered from MI. They provided us with a rental car and we drove 3 1\/2 hours to a friend's house where we have been for a week now. Because we can't afford a hotel for this long. It has now been 12 days since I left Calif. to go to NC, I have never been on such a long road trip, I only hope that I make it to NC in 14 days for my grandson's birthday.","391":"After being told in El Paso that there was nothing wrong with the car, we made it 248 miles before we stalled out again. Knowing that there was nothing between where we were until SAN Antonio an 8 hour drive. We took it to the closest dealership only to be told that the computer didn't show anything wrong and they could not fix anything if the computer showed nothing was wrong.This has turned into nightmare of trips, I left California on the 26th of June, and should have been almost at my destination after 4 days on the road. But I was still in the beginning of Texas!","392":"Driving up mountain pass (max grade of 7%) at ~65mph when vehicle suddenly felt like it shifted in to neutral. Pulled vehicle to the shoulder of the interstate where it stalled and message on display read, \"To put your vehicle in shift it must be in park\". Turned car off and on again, attempted to start going forward and car immediately stalled a 2nd time with the same message being displayed. Turned vehicle off for a couple of minutes, then on. Since car did not immediately stall we pulled back on to the interstate where it again felt like it went into neutral. Pulled to side of interstate and car stalled a 3rd time, with the same message. It was tried shifting into manual mode with no difference noticed.Vehicle had to be towed to nearest Jeep dealer where it stayed overnight. Dealership was not able to replicate issue and no error codes were found. Vehicle was driven ~50mi to a dealer closer to town where it was stayed for 3 days. Second dealer was also not able to replicate issue and no error codes were found.This car has gone over the exact same pass previously with no issue, as well as multiple others."},"title":{"0":"Escalade","1":"Escalade","2":"XC90","3":"XC90","4":"XC90 Inscription T8","5":"XC90","6":"XC90 Inscription T8","7":"Q7","8":"Q7","9":"Q7","10":"Q7 Prestige 3.O","11":"Q7
