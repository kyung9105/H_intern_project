The passenger pulled the shoulder strap out to pull around and buckle to the seat latch when the latch plate just slide right off of the belt. There was nothing securing the shoulder strap. It just came apart. I went to the dealership to have the problem checked out and fixed as I was certain it would be covered under the car's warranty. I was shocked to find out that I would have to pay a couple of hundred dollars to have the seat-belt fixed! how could the dealer/manufacturer not be responsible for a seat-belt malfunction? I still have the seat-belt problem as I believe that Hyundai should fix it and not charge me. If this happened to me, then I feel that it probably has happened to other vehicle owners so I am trying to find out if this is a wider spread problem than just a fluke with me.-Kensington, MD, USA",Santa Fe 6-cyl,2012

I was shocked as I believed that a seat belt malfunction was a safety issue that any dealer would take immediate responsibility for. When I insisted that the I did absolutely nothing to cause the malfunction and the dealership should fix it I was told that they would have to check it out with a higher management level and would get back to me. I have had no follow up from fitzgerald. I followed up twice by email once using their own website form hoping that would get a response, but still nothing. I am now concerned that this issue with the seatbelt may be a problem with other Hyundai owners so I am reporting the problem.

On dirt shoulder of freeway attempting with manual brakes and steering to bring vehicle off roadway. Vehicle restarted during maneuver. Still moving at safe speed attempted to merge back onto the freeway, having not yet decelerated enough yet to continue to pull over....clear and dry conditions in North la county. This vehicle however has always had ""overly responsive"" or ""very tight"" steering, for lack of better terminology. I leased the vehicle and did not fully realize, until some time passed, what this 'steering characteristic' would mean in the future, in an event requiring accurate and responsive steering combined with the ability to maintain control. The sudden engine power resuming, combined with, what this writer would describe as ""tight steering"" to begin with, made the vehicle roll. The vehicle, with what felt like a ""high center of gravity"" always felt like it would roll if one were to have to move quickly to avoid something in the road for example. I did not realize this feature during my test drive. Being a lessee I was obligated to keep the vehicle for 3 years. The vehicle rolled several times while crossing 3 lanes of an occupied northbound highway 14. A sudden jolt resulted in a fracture of L1 vertebrae. During roll, jack became undone from where it was factory mounted underneath lift up cover, and had never been removed.

Dealer diagnosed it as a known issue related to tsb: 13 fl 002 (throttle body bore carbon fouling / P2106/P2110 limphome mode / P0638 throttle actuator control range and that the break issue was due to excessive break booster air causing the throttle assembly to lock open.

When the car stalls, the driver loses power steering and brakes. It is a very dangerous situation. After the third time the car stalled we took it in for service in April of 2013 to the local Hyundai dealership. The technician ran a complete diagnostic and said he could not find anything wrong with the vehicle. We refused to take the car at that time and insisted on more testing. They did find a problem. They replaced/repaired the etc-actuator and gasket-throttle body. The car ran fine until last week when it started the same problems again. It has stalled four times in the last week. The latest stall happened today when my girlfriend was driving the car at around 30 mph. It also stalled last night when I was driving it home at about 25 mph. I was able to get to the side of the road and put the car in park. I turned the key and it started right up again. When it stalled on me, I lost power steering and power brakes.

I coasted to my destination (less than a block away) and called my service rep at danbury Hyundai (ct). She told me it was due to an incorrect gas cap replacement, to undo the gas cap and start the car. It worked. After the first episode, this absolute powering down of everything, brake, steering, control; happened so often, it became routine. Gas tank filling had no bearing-but it happened at stop lights or stop signs, so I was able to coast to the side of the road, put the car in park and restart it.

I was on a busy local road that passes through danbury when the car's engine light came on, without me being at a stop sign or red light, or even braking for any reason, and I lost all control of the vehicle. This happens so suddenly, I might add, that you have no time to even activate the emergency flashers, or do anything besides grab the wheel with both hands and try to get over as far to the right as possible to avoid being hit from behind. I narrowly escaped being rear ended by a dump trunk directly behind me. I put the car into park, started it up, and called my service dept. At Hyundai. I explained that this happened again, since I had originally told them when I had the car serviced in may of 2014, and they had told me then, that they couldn't duplicate it, so they couldn't fix it.

Frankly, I thought it was related to the sandals I was wearing. I thought I was occasionally stepping on the gas and the brake at the same time (I have very big feet -- size fifteen). The problem stopped when I switched shoes (which also corresponded to the end of summer). The problem came back intermittently this summer and is now repeatable. When I am going down a steep hill at speeds over about 20 mph, the engine RPM's increase when I step on the brake. It does that while in gear and while in neutral. Obviously, if the drive train is in gear, the engine ""fights against"" the brake; if the drive train is in neutral, the engine revs. If the engine is in neutral or is shifted into neutral after the acceleration starts, the engine races until I let off the brake. It has gone as high as 4-5 K RPM before I let off the brake. All that's required to get the car to return to normal idle is that I pump the brake (let off the brake all the way -- I can immediately re-apply the brake and the problem won't happen again).

She told me it was due to an incorrect gas cap replacement, to undo the gas cap and start the car. It worked. After the first episode, this absolute powering down of everything, brake, steering, control; happened so often, it became routine. Gas tank filling had no bearing-but it happened at stop lights or stop signs, so I was able to coast to the side of the road, put the car in park and restart it. All that confidence evaporated yesterday. I was due to get on the highway and drive about 45 minutes on a combination of highway and thruway to my daughter's. I was on a busy local road that passes through danbury when the car's engine light came on, without me being at a stop sign or red light, or even braking for any reason, and I lost all control of the vehicle. This happens so suddenly, I might add, that you have no time to even activate the emergency flashers, or do anything besides grab the wheel with both hands and try to get over as far to the right as possible to avoid being hit from behind. I narrowly escaped being rear ended by a dump trunk directly behind me. I put the car into park, started it up, and called my service dept. At Hyundai. I explained that this happened again, since I had originally told them when I had the car serviced in may of 2014, and they had told me then, that they couldn't duplicate it, so they couldn't fix it.

After the third time the car stalled we took it in for service in April of 2013 to the local Hyundai dealership.

I asked maguire to take responsibility for this weird accident, but they said that the fault is to Hyundai not them, while Hyundai customer service told me that the responsibility is kumho tire's. therefore, I asked kumho to take responsibility for my accident and asked the money for the repairing cost of my car. They first claimed that the tire has no technical problem since there is no more air leaking, so they can't pay the repairment cost. Nonetheless, the tire was flattened, which is an unchangeable fact, so I asked once more to take responsibility of my accident.

We then checked the manual and it stated there might be an emissions problem so we checked to make sure the gas cap was tight. We started it again, but the light came on again. We backed up the car, but it would barely move. We called the dealership to have it towed and checked. The dealer called us the next day and said someone cut the wires above the accelerator pedal. That claim was suspicious because the vehicle is locked inside the garage and our house has a security system and a large dog. We also had 6 family member staying with us. Opening the garage door would have woke someone up. Also, the vehicles outside the garage were unlocked and untouched. After reading some complaints on here, I see there is an ongoing issue that may have been covered up by the dealership by cutting the wires. The location of the wires would have been extremely difficult to get to inside my garage.

I called the dealership again and they told me to bring it in for a software upgrade. I asked if in fact they could just put in a new throttle actuator and they said it cost between $600-$1,000.

I leased the vehicle and did not fully realize, until some time passed, what this 'steering characteristic' would mean in the future, in an event requiring accurate and responsive steering combined with the ability to maintain control. The sudden engine power resuming, combined with, what this writer would describe as ""tight steering"" to begin with, made the vehicle roll. The vehicle, with what felt like a ""high center of gravity"" always felt like it would roll if one were to have to move quickly to avoid something in the road for example. I did not realize this feature during my test drive. Being a lessee I was obligated to keep the vehicle for 3 years. The vehicle rolled several times while crossing 3 lanes of an occupied northbound highway 14. A sudden jolt resulted in a fracture of L1 vertebrae.

He said they could duplicate the problem only when they left footed braked and their solution was to not do that. I asked some more questions, basically why that would make a difference since we have always done it. He said since the Toyota problems the sensors in cars are more sensitive? I told him there are over 80 complaints with the ODI for same problem in 2012 Santa Fe - he said oh that is a different problem - I read all of them - trouble sounds the same to me. We researched this car before buying - nothing in their advertisements, paperwork or on the net said left footed braking will cause your car to stall - we would not have purchased it however, I am not even positive that is the problem. I did also open a complaint with Hyundai - they denied a claim of a lemon car and said to just to stop braking left footed.

According to the Carfax the vehicle had been taken care of and well maintained for the most part by Hyundai Dealerships. On the 2-week mark of owning this piece of crap the engine blew. While on the Interstate and with NO warning whatsoever the engine started making a loud banging noise then shut down leaving us stranded on the side of the highway.The car was towed to my local Hyundai Dealership for diagnosis. They determined the engine was destroyed and metal fragments were found in the oil pan. The Service Manager then informed me that the 10-year 100k mile powertrain warranty that Hyundai is known for is only valid for the original owner of the vehicle. And the subsequent owner warranty is only given a 5-year 60k mile warranty. So my miles were within warranty, but conveniently for Hyundai the 5 year mark was over 4 months before I took ownership of the vehicle. So, after one month of owning this oversized piece of crap Hyundai, and two weeks since the engine blew up I am in a battle with Hyundai to stand behind their piece of crap Santa fe.Now here's the kicker: After much frustration going back and forth with Hyundai Customer Care (a joke all in itself) and my local Service Manager I decided to do some research to see if anyone else has had a similar issue. LOW AND BEHOLD, on the very day my engine blew Hyundai was forced to issue a recall on over a HALF MILLION Hyundai Santa fe and Sonata vehicles for possible engine failure due to a faulty engine manufacturing process that leaves metal fragments in the engine that will cause the engine to prematurely wear out. And of course, conveniently Hyundai says my engine is not part of that recall so they are doing NOTHING for me. any IDIOT can see that this is related.Engines today that are well maintained do NOT blow at 54k miles.

No warning lights, just a very loud noise and then nothing. I had it towed to the Hyundai dealer who had been servicing my car and was told that since I bought the car used and I didn't buy it from them, I would have to pay to have the engine replaced.The dealership said a new engine would cost 5500 but Hyundai Corporate would take off 2300, and the dealership would take off 300 leaving me with about 3200 to pay. I explored the internet and found that Hyundai recalled the Sonata engines because of engine failures. And then I found that my Santa Fe has the same engine as all of the Sonatas, so why not recall them, too? I am 65 yrs old, retired and not working and I thought this would be the last car I would own in my life. I do not have the money to replace this engine and I am in debt with my husband's nursing home costs.He passed in 2014 but his bills are still with me.I received a very nasty phone call from a woman who did not identify herself, just asked me if I was Evelyn and when I answered yes, she started yelling that I was not going to get an engine. I was stunned at her tone and when I tried to speak she interrupted constantly and just kept yelling you are not getting a new engine! I ended the call by telling her this call was going no where and I said good-bye. I want to know what happened to Hyundai's America's Best Warranty? I was told that this warranty went to the 1st owner? What? Why doesn't it follow the car? I am told that the connecting rod bearing failed in my engine and that may have destroyed the crankshaft and/or other parts. I had nothing to do with this destruction of my engine. I maintained this car according to the manufacture's suggestions and I am disgusted that Hyundai is not helping me more with this problem.

I placed my SUV stick in PARK, re-started the engine and shifted to DRIVE and off I went.It did not happen again from that time on until middle of last year, so I simply ignored and did not report the incident to the car dealer.Around July of 2014, my family and I were in Qatar for holidays. The engine stalling incident re-occurred one time during decelerating towards a red traffic light. I placed my SUV stick in PARK, re-started the engine and shifted to DRIVE and off we proceeded with our trip.The latest engine stalling incident (third on my experience with my SUV) happened just last Thursday at around 4PM (20th August 2015) when I was approaching and decelerating towards a red traffic light on my way back to the office. The car did re-started after I placed my SUV stick in PARK, re-started the engine and shifted to DRIVE.This time, however, I am considering to lodge a formal complaint. It seems that I am not the only one suffering from this engine stalling issue which, although intermittent, makes my car unreliable and unsafe on the road, especially that I am driving with my family around the Kingdom on a daily basis, to/from Bahrain on a weekly basis and at times to Qatar on annual basis, for the last 15 years (this 2012 Santa Fe is my third car).",Santa Fe GLS 3.5L V6,2015

They said they couldn't find anything wrong with the vehicles parts, that wasn't caused by the accident. This makes me more convinced it has to be the tire. This is the second tire that has blown out on the outside wall of the tire since I purchased this vehicle in 2013. The other blow out was from a nail going through the outside wall.

When I attempted to fill up the gas tank for the first time, the gas pump continuously shut off automatically as if the tank was full. It took approximately 15-20 minutes to fill up 3/4 of the tank. I initially thought it was the gas pump that was bad. About a week later, when I attempted to fill up again, the same problem occurred on a different pump. I tried a couple of different gas stations, and the problem continued. I took the vehicle in to a Hyundai dealership for a check up. After a preliminary check, the dealer advised that there was no error code. However, in order for them to remove the tank and check the entire assembly, the gas tank was too full, so I needed to drive it around and use up some gas until it was less than 1/2 tank full. So after a few days, I took it in again. After a few days, they advised that the after removing the tank, they observed the fuel tank neck end had been melted. They were not sure what the cause was. So they replaced the fuel tank, and filled the gas tank without any issues. We just got the car back, so we'll see it the problem has been fixed, or if it'll be a recurring problem. We thought it was very odd that a brand new car would have this problem, and we're more concerned what caused it to ""melt"". if there is a major heat issue that would cause something to melt near the gas tank, this is a very serious concern.

The right front wheel had a blow out from the outside side wall of the tire. The mechanic said it looked slashed.

I don't know, but I feel something happened to cause that sharp right turn in the first place. I had the mechanic check out the right front wheel area (axle, etc). They said they couldn't find anything wrong with the vehicles parts, that wasn't caused by the accident. This makes me more convinced it has to be the tire. This is the second tire that has blown out on the outside wall of the tire since I purchased this vehicle in 2013. The other blow out was from a nail going through the outside wall.

Not only because glass could be blown with significant force throughout the vehicle, but because if it happened at highway speed, it might make it impossible to control the vehicle due to shock of the explosion and glass being shot everywhere. Since this is a recurring problem with Hyundai, there needs to be a permanent fix applied to any vehicle that has experienced this sunroof problem when it is repaired.

The SUV had 11 miles on it and I knew it would be perfect for our family. I wanted to get something reliable, safe, good gas mileage, and a great warranty.Saturday, September 2, 2015, I took my daughter to the mall. After an evening of shopping, we got back to the SUV. The key fob / proximity sensor didn't work. I brought her stroller closer and closer to the car to make sure that I was ""within range"" for the sensor to work. I checked my purse and realized that it must have ""fallen off"" or ""detached"" at some point during the day. There was no warning. The key portion was attached to my key ring along with my TrackR device (should something happen to my keys, I would be able to locate them). However, since the black part of the key fob fell off and isn't attached to the key ring, there wasn't any way to find it.I spent another 2 hours re-walking / re-tracing my steps in hopes of finding the black electronics portion of the key fob. I left my name and number at numerous stores in hopes that they would find it.In the end, no luck. I was stranded with my two year old child.Thankfully my husband was at home and was able to bring the spare set of keys to us. If we would have been traveling out of state, we would have been stranded.He went online to see if this was a common problem. To his surprise, there were numerous complaints. However, our Hyundai Dealership stated that they were ""unaware of this problem"" and were not able to find complaints about it.Now my car that was supposed to be purchased to keep my family safe and secure makes me stressed out and nervous. I am constantly checking my keys to make sure that the black electronics portion of the key fob is still attached. There needs to be some type of re-call or fix for drivers who have these key fobs.Another big concern is that this SUV is the primary vehicle for us when we drive long distances to visit family and vacation. We took our SUV to Florida last year. Now I'm concerned that if I would be out of town and this would happen, I would be stranded. This could be a life or death situation should I lose the key electronics at an inopportune time.The key fob needs to have a better / more secure way to hold the electronics portion of the key fob on the key.

A loud noise occurred (as if running over an obstacle), the engine lost all power and died. Upon restart, the vehicle would not move either forward or backward in reverse. After setting awhile, we were able to very slowly drive the car about 500 to 1000 feet to the dealership. Ruddell dealership was unable to repeat the experience. I now do not trust the vehicle and want it thoroughly inspected to determine if it too has a cracked axle as noted in the newspaper article. We have a road trip planned in early August and do not want to drive this car until it is thoroughly inspected. I took the car to ruddell auto on July 10 and showed them the associated press article but they did not offer to do anything about it. Ruddell said they would have to wait until Hyundai issued a campaign or recall but that is not satisfactory or acceptable. The car now has about 7400 miles on it.

The only discernible pattern is that it happens when accelerating from rest or from slow speed. It has happened about 15 times in the first 800 miles of driving. When I begin to accelerate slowly forward from rest or from a slow forward roll there is no response. It feels like the engine has stalled, but hasn't. continuing to push down brings no result. After approximately a 2 to 5 second delay, the rpms begin to build up rapidly. The first two or three times it happened I suddenly surged forward in a very dangerous manner. The real problem, however, is that with following traffic expecting me to accelerate and continue to accelerate and I suddenly stop accelerating without having applied brakes, thus activating brake lights, there is a rear end collision waiting to happen. Here is an example from last night. I was rolling slowly in a left turn lane, foot off the gas, waiting for oncoming traffic to clear. It did and I begin the turn simultaneously pressing down on the pedal--no response. Let up and pressed down again--no response. I let up again, rpms came up, I pressed down again and proceed normally into a parking lot. I was perpendicular to 3 lanes of oncoming traffic and dead in the water for maybe 3 to 5 seconds. Essentially the same thing has happened while accelerating out of a U turn and also coming out of a slow right turn. It happened while accelerating slowly through an opening security gate. I have left the car with the dealer overnight so they could drive it and hook it up to their error code machines. They could not observe the issue or diagnose the problem.

To me, this is a serious safety issue. Not only because glass could be blown with significant force throughout the vehicle, but because if it happened at highway speed, it might make it impossible to control the vehicle due to shock of the explosion and glass being shot everywhere. Since this is a recurring problem with Hyundai, there needs to be a permanent fix applied to any vehicle that has experienced this sunroof problem when it is repaired.

The right front wheel had a blow out from the outside side wall of the tire. The mechanic said it looked slashed. The big question is, did the blow out occur at the time my vehicle made the sharp right turn at the intersection, or did it occur when it hit the curb? I don't know, but I feel something happened to cause that sharp right turn in the first place. I had the mechanic check out the right front wheel area (axle, etc). They said they couldn't find anything wrong with the vehicles parts, that wasn't caused by the accident. This makes me more convinced it has to be the tire. This is the second tire that has blown out on the outside wall of the tire since I purchased this vehicle in 2013. The other blow out was from a nail going through the outside wall.

I paid a reasonable price for it. I have it serviced on a regular schedule because my husband uses it for travel with his work, so we need to make sure it's well maintained.On 09/14/2016 I took it in for a regular oil change at one of the two dealerships I regularly use, and when I went to pay for the service the invoice came out to be double the price, I inquired about it and the service advisor had mentioned that the price was correct because it was synthetic blend, I then informed him that I have never had this type of oil in my vehicle before and was worried if it might cause a problem for me, he assured me that because my vehicle was getting up there in mileage it was better to start using this type of oil, and rather then bringing it every 3,000 miles, I now could wait until 5,000 to 6,000 miles. I agreed paid for the service and went on my way.Fast forward 5,000 miles, and no warning light came out, my husband was on a business trip coming home he started to hear a noise in the engine he pulled over checked all the fluids and discovered that there was no OIL in the engine! after further investigation going under the vehicle to see maybe a leak. None was found he called one of his friends who was on the same trip with to go by and get some oil so that he could add it, it was done and my husband continued his trip, he went 50 miles before he heard a knocking noise in the engine and it started to smoke and pulled over the engine was blown.We had it towed to a dealership to get an diagnose we were told they found metal debris in the engine due to lack of oil, and it needed to be replaced, the estimate I received was $10,000 to replace the engine! this website did not allow me to add the price to replace or repair the engine, because it was too high! but that's the price I received! they found no leak and they could not explain why the lack of oil in the engine. the only thing the mechanic told me is that it might be a defect in the engine it self, to take it to the dealership that repairs Hyundai's and get a second option, I did go to that dealership and was treated very poorly by the service advisor there and SHE let me know that because I thought it might be a manufacture defect, that they did not want to get involved and repair or give me a estimate for the cost of repairs!I have purchased a number of vehicles there through out my life, I will NEVER drop another penny with them again. P.S because I am the 2nd owner, the 100,000 mile warranty does not extent to me, it ran out at 60,000 miles. I'm lost on what to do next! has anyone else had this problem as well? if so any advise or assistance would be greatly appreciated.Lost in Las Cruces!!",Santa Fe 2.0L,2016

My dealership was aware that I was going to be driving on the highway and were aware of this engine problem but I was not made aware until there was a problem. My family and I could have been hurt and/or hurt others on the highway if this would have happened then. We are thankful there are no injuries.At first I was happy that my dealer made arrangements for a rental vehicle because they had no courtesy vehicles for me to use. What I was unaware of is that they only pay for 5 days. After that it is up to the consumer to pay the rental costs and I am hearing from others that had this same issue that they had no vehicle for over 30 days. This becomes costly. I have spent all day trying to see if I will get reimbursed for this cost and every person I talk to puts the blame on someone else. No one is being accountable.I have been loyal and serviced my vehicle regularly. I purchased the extended warranty and everything that was offered to make sure that I had the best protection. Now Hyundai will only take care of my vehicle needs for 5 days when they know it takes 5 days to hear if Hyundai is going to cover the damages that was caused by a flaw that they are fully aware of. Poor service and they are lacking in caring for their customers. The sales part was awesome but now the honeymoon is over.I have heard from 2 other Hyundai owners that they are going through the same problems.

Again, tok it to the Hyundai, they put their instruments and diagnosed that NOTHING WAS WRONG.Month later, first engine light came along with a loss of power while driving in a highway. Guys in the shop repaced a bad sparkplug. Again the same thing with the vibration during mornings and after the egine gets cold. Two more instances with the engine light On, due to this anoying problems tha according to Hyundai , was a defect on the spark modules. Replaced modules and with the last visit they also replaced the Fuled module of a few psitons.

On June 21,2014 After grocery shopping my family and I were on our way home when I tried to enter the freeway and accelerate the car would not speed up and began to jerk violently. I had to pull towards the shoulder to avoid being rear ended. Once the traffic had cleared I pulled out and tried again and it happen again, I let off the gas pedal and it stopped. I had to accelerate very slowly so the jerking would stop, any time you try to accelerate quickly it would Jerk and not pick up speed.On June 26,2014 my wife with our children took the car in at 10:00 am. I called my wife at 11:45 am to see if they had done a test drive she said no the car was still sitting there. I called her back at 12:57 pm and they had done the test drive and found that the car did have something very wrong with it and they had to do some diagnostics to figure out what was wrong. So my wife asked if there was a shuttle available they said none was available. So my family continued to wait. At 1:47 pm my wife called me at work saying they were stuck there because they don't have a shuttle. I told my wife I would call her back to go, and ask if there is an ETA for the diagnostics, and if not, if there is no shuttle what about a loner or a rent a car.So I called her back at 2:08 pm and she was told no to all of the above and the supervisor told her why she didn't bring the car in earlier. I had my wife put the service consultant on the phone and express to him that the reason we bought a new vehicle was so we didn't have to go through this, also I called in advance and made clear of the issue. My family has been there now for over 4 hours and you still don't know what's wrong. I asked to speak with the supervisor but he said she had just gone off to a meeting. I asked if he could please see what he could do. At 3:22 I called my wife back and they finally got her into a car so they could leave.On June 27,2014 at 10:20 am my wife got a call. They told her the High Pressure fuel pump needed to be replaced They said it's going to take about a week to get the part and put it in. They told her to bring the car she had back to switch it out for a Rental. When my wife went to pick up the rental. They were going to give her an Elantra.They told her that was the only car available. My wife said it was too small for a family of 5, that's the reason we purchased a Santa Fe. So they called Nissan to see if they had a car to loan. They had a van but it wasn't going to be back at 6 pm that evening. Instead they gave her a Altima to use for that day, and to come back the following day to switch it out for a Nissan Quest. So now another 2 days of our time wasted switching cars.On July 5,2014 the high pressure fuel pump was changed but the vehicle had the same issue. Now they would need to consult with a Technician from the Mainland. On July 16,2014 at 4:42 p.m They called with an update. They stated that in addition to the High pressure fuel pump they had to replace the fuel rail pressure sensor,remove the fuel tank and the fuel feed line because the fuel feed line had collapsed. They were going to do more testing the following day.On July 17,2014 at 2:52 p.m Jay called to say the car was completed. So almost a month to get it fixed and horrible customer service the whole way. Now my concern is how many factory seals needed to be broken to fix this.

I had noticed a faint, occasional ticking noise for about 1 week prior to this but hadn't had the chance to bring it in. No warning lights ever came on. Prior to the warranty running out I had taken it in to the local dealer due to possible transmission slipping but no problem was found. There's a surprise!I pulled off the highway, stopped at a red light and the car stalled. I managed to get it started to get it out of the intersection, pulled off on a side street and towed to the dealer. The next day I was informed the lower half of the engine had to be replaced. All regular oil changes had been done and transmission service done at 96,000 km. The dealer stated a request had been sent to Hyundai Canada to cover the cost. I had just heard about a recall re:engine failure prior to this but had not received a letter in the mail yet. When I asked about that, the question was dodged and I was told I'd get a letter.We were told the dealer would arrange a courtesy car or a rental for us then a day later said they wouldn't. We got our own rental which they said they would reimburse us for. They haven't. After having the car for 1 MONTH it was fixed and Hyundai Canada did cover it so I have to give them a little credit there. While driving it home the battery light came on. Clearly they didn't check it before they gave it back. We reported it and were told ""I don't know why it would do that"". The light went off and it seemed to be ok until a few days later it just died in the middle of the street.Towed to Hyundai again and they said it was a fuse on the battery which can happen if it's jump started. We never jump started it so clearly they must have, but wanted us to pay for it. We argued and argued and finally the manager handed us the keys and we were gone.

Or 0 deg toe) or an electric power steering system issue (torque sensor too coarse, drive motor too aggressive, or improper gain (I.e. system responds too late to input, then over responds when it does respond))...though these are educated guesses. My first dealers refused to check the alignment because they ""have to drive the vehicle to confirm the issue, "" and ""they are not allow to drive over 65 mph.""

Sometimes left sometimes right and the road crown plays no part in the direction. Dealer aligned all 4 wheels twice. Added toe in and camber to the rear. Also, replaced rear springs and shocks.

I have had multiple incidents when making right and left hand turns onto streets/roads without street lights where my car's lights do not illuminate the road I am turning onto until I completely make the turn. In several instances as I made the turn I could not see the road and I over shot the turn and drove well onto the berm and was able to stop and steer back onto the road or I turned too soon. Another instance was when I went down an embankment and was able to stop before hitting the bottom. Luckily these were no accidents involving vehicle damage or personal injury/death. The only way that I can see the side street, road or driveway I am turning onto is to turn on my bright lights. Obviously, this is very upsetting to oncoming drivers and a potential safety issue. In addition, at night when stopped or driving straight there is a black void approximately 15 feet in front of the vehicle. On one occasion I practically ran over an obstacle since it was too dark to see it. I took the SUV to my Hyundai dealer and explained the problems. Their solution is to use the fog lamps all the time at night. This addresses the black void in front of the car.

The outside part of the sun roof that was still attached was also entirely shattered. I proceeded directly to a Hyundai dealer who took pictures to document the damage.

It is not only that the vehicle wonders, but it does so mildly and aggressively. The vehicle tends to sway and rock all while trying to correct for the continuous wondering. It's a very odd sensation that occurs, just when you think you might go straight for a bit the vehicle will dart to one side and it has no rhythm or reason. Sometimes left sometimes right and the road crown plays no part in the direction. Dealer aligned all 4 wheels twice. Added toe in and camber to the rear. Also, replaced rear springs and shocks. Turns out one of the springs was shorter than the other by 1/4"" causing the suspension to be unbalanced. This repair helped for some of the unexplained rocking but now that it is fixed the whole steering issue has been exacerbated. I don't feel safe in the vehicle and intend on selling it. Currently, it has 11K miles. I logged another complaint with Hyundai customer service today too. The fact that potential buyers rarely get to drive the new car for more than 7-10 miles and at speeds rarely above city is a disservice.

I recently had to replace my wiring harness, assorted sensors and the vehicles inboard computer due to rodents chewing on the wiring. I own a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. It was in the shop from July 6th to July 20th for these repairs. There repairs totaled just under $6,000.00 Fortunately my auto comprehensive covered all but the deductible. I was not offered a loaner car because this was not a warranty issue.A little Google research has enlightened me to the fact that this is not at all that uncommon, there have been thousands of cases this has been happening for years. Some years ago in an attempt to produce greener products , the maker of the wiring insulation changed to a soy based product. Well it should be no surprise that mice, chipmunks, squirrels, etc would be attracted to this product. These wiring products are in Toyotas, Hyundais, GM, Nissans and who knows how many other.Now back to my dealership, I asked the service person if they had many cases of rodent damage and he acknowledged that they did. Then I asked what he thought would be attracting rodents to the wiring, he said the insulation contains a soy based material. At this point I asked him why would the manufacturer continue to use this product knowing that this problem existed. His answer was that they don't make the wiring harness and that it's contracted out(kind of like airbags). So then I asked if they weren't responsible for the products that go into their vehicles even from third party vendors,I got basically a blank look. It's not covered under your warranty sir so check your insurance. So here we have the auto industry aware of a problem for years and have not taken any action to fix the problem(shameful).

Tried to get my phone to call help - no phone reception no cell service....Took my sweater of to clean my lights , so cars can clearly see my warning lights...as the snow was melting and the roads made my car very dirty. Packed the most important stuff - was scared as it smelled bad and hitch hiked to the next town Falkland. Called the Automobile Club they said they would just tow me 25 km or miles it would be around 82 on way ... and I am about 8 km closer to Vernon and they have to tow me to Vernon.OMG what to do .. I called Dons towing and they said they will pick me up and bring my car to Hyundai in Kamloops. Still waiting at the Ranch Cafe in Falkland 4 hours later the tow truck picks me up, we drive to my car .... Thursday night. I am home..... Friday I am calling my boss if he can pick me up to work. I call Hyundai tell them about my car.... they ask me if I purchased extended warranty.... I didn't. They said they can't start anything before I have all my service receipts with them.... at this time it was Friday afternoon and I had all but one with them.They also said to me at this point that they wouldn't pay for a rental car.... I felt very depressed and disappointed...I got them the one missing service receipt Friday late afternoon. I was very disappointed I had not missed a single service and I got treated like I did something wrong....After sharing my story with a friend, about a week later, he said I should call a different dealer ship.

It did show a code. I took it into the dealer for service. They told me that the software had the fuel pressure set too low. The problem seemed to disappear and they cleared the code.Today I was passing a large truck on a two lane highway. Just as I was even with the long truck, power suddenly disappeared. I must have been going around 80mph. I was able to brake and get over to the shoulder. I killed the engine and restarted it and the problem disappeared. I called the dealer and told the service manager about what happened and that there was no code showing. All he told me was that it just cleared itself. Duh! This is the sort of thing that could get somebody killed.Coming back home from the above trip, I got to thinking about duplicating what happened so I got up to cruising speed at 65mph and than suddenly accelerated. At just about 80mph or maybe a little over, the engine cut out and I started slowing. As it started slowing to around 50mph, I pushed down on the accelerator again and nothing happened. I pulled over, killed and restarted the engine and the problem went away.I repeated this twice more (same trip) and got the same results each time. At around 80 to 85mph, power was lost. I placed a call to the service manager at the dealer. I am now waiting for him to return my call.Again, I just want to emphasize that this sort of thing will get somebody killed.Update from Aug 11, 2015:As of 10 August 2015, the vehicle is in the dealer service center and they provided me with a loaner vehicle.  On the way to the dealer that morning, I duplicated the loss of power problem once again.  Once arriving at the dealer, the service manager duplicated the engine shutdown problem by running it up to 80+ mph.  The manager thinks the problem is caused by low rail pressure (gas line) at that speed but they need time to evaluate it.  They did say that they have not encountered this problem previously although it has obviously been reported for older Santa Fe vehicles by others which can be found by searching ""loss of power"" and ""Hyundai Santa Fe"" on the Internet.  According to the service manager, the engine service light came on and indicated a failure code which did not happen for me. We are now in a waiting mode.Update from Aug 13, 2015:I had a call from the service manager this morning (August 13) and he informed me that they had determined that the problem seemed to be the double walled fuel line coming from the high pressure pump to the low pressure pump in the tank. They ordered the new line and it just arrived. They will be putting it in along with a new high pressure fuel pump. They think that the double wall line got kinked in shipping to the factory for vehicle assembly causing a flow restriction. Since junk could have got into the high pressure pump, they decided it would be best to replace the pump. We should know in a few days if this fixes the problem.",Santa Fe V6,2015

After coming to a stop, the vehicle was stranded in place until it was able to start up again many minutes later. Fortunately no one was physically harmed as the individual driving behind our vehicle was observant enough to identify the issue (despite a lack of brake lights or hazards) and stop in time. No visible engine light or fault code was triggered. Less severe problem: On a regular basis, the vehicle suffers abrupt and sustained loss of power in merging situations (especially when turning on city streets from a stop). This seems to be from an overactive or otherwise ineffective traction control system/programming. Despite even planning for the possible loss of power, this has still resulted in a number of ""near miss"" situations.

741,engine,loss_of_power_during_acceleration,F.Woodland,US,Apr 01,hyundai,Santa_fe,2017.0,"Automatic transmission-1,500 miles","Purchased the car new from the dealer. The engine and safety issues can make this car somewhat dangerous to drive.ISSUES:
- From a complete stop and then turning right uphill, the car stalls/hesitates during acceleration, can come to a complete stop and can even start rolling backwards during acceleration uphill. Specifically, when turning right and accelerating uphill, the traction control switches on automatically, which can cause a complete loss of torque and also pushes RPM's to well over 6000 while the car is attempting to shift from first to second gear. This creates a dangerous stall situation and also causes the steering and handling to become unpredictable. This could lead to a potentially dangerous safety condition of the car rolling back into another car or over-steering into traffic/curb.- The ""Eco Mode"" is dangerous. The steering is much too loose during this mode and can lead to over-steering while driving at higher speeds. I've tested this mode extensively and there also appears to be absolutely no fuel savings between it and the standard driving mode. This mode can also cause a complete loss of torque/acceleration and creates a stall/hesitation during acceleration from a stop while trying to enter and merge onto freeways. Avoid ever using this mode as it is definitely not worth the risk and is not saving much if any fuel. The Hyundai manual claims the car has ""260 ft lbs of torque"", but this may be an inaccurate claim.- Did not realize that the collision avoidance systems and automatic braking are not standard on the premium trim package for the Ultimate. They are only standard the ""Ultimate Tech Package"". These features are prominently displayed on the Hyundai USA website, but are not featured with the premium package. These safety systems are going to be standard on all new vehicles starting in 2022. Why they did not include these as standard safety features with their premium package is beyond me. Hyundai also indicates that they do not offer a standard safety features upgrade with the premium package, as it is only sold with the ""Ultimate Tech Package"".POSSIBLE SOLUTION?
- One solution may be to reprogram the computer, so when the car is started, the default is ""Sport"" mode with traction control turned off. Also, the gear ratio from first to second gear is too high/wide and needs to be set to start shifting at around 4-5000 RPMs from a stop during acceleration (as it should not be going over 6000 RPMs while attempting to shift from 1st to 2nd gear).CONCLUSION
Overall, I really like the premium features this car offers (panoramic sunroof, push-button start, auto lift-gate, overall driving comfort, etc.), however I'm very disappointed and concerned with this car overall and I feel that Hyundai has not been very receptive to my concerns. I'm taking it to back to the dealer to see if any of these issues can be worked out. A $40k car should not have these issues and I'm also frustrated at the lack of standard safety features, and that this was not disclosed during purchase.",Santa Fe Sport Ultimate 2.0t,2017

Merging into traffic), usually turning to the right or left, the vehicle hesitates for what seems to be more that a couple of seconds. The hesitation is enough to cause panic that oncoming traffic will have to stop abruptly to avoid a collision. On one occasion, the vehicle was pulled off the side of the road to get out of the way of traffic because it would not accelerate fast enough. The condition is very worrisome because you never know when it will occur, we can't seem to make it happen on command.

Additionally, we have noticed that the vehicle has a hard time selecting a gear when downshifting while moving at around 30-40 mph.

This in turn takes 4-6 seconds to decide to turn itself off.  While doing this, you have very little acceleration capability.  Its quite dangerous in my opinion as you might be pulling into traffic.

I drove the car home, about 5 minutes from the dealership. All seemed well. The next day, I went on a road trip from Kennesaw to Savannah, GA, which is about 300 miles. The car drove mostly okay. While driving 55+ on the highway, I noticed constantly having to correct the steering wheel as the car wanted to veer left or right. It wasn't horrible just yet. I arrived late night in Savannah, very excited about my new car. It was a fun drive aside from the odd steering that wouldn't stay straight. I parked the car at my mother's house (who lives in Savannah). Savannah is a walking town, so NO need for the car while I was there. I did not drive the car again until Sunday, March 20, when I returned to Atlanta. The first 20 minutes of the trip was about like the drive down from Atlanta. I had to keep the steering wheel in check. VERY ANNOYING. But soon, it started feeling worse, more drastic pulling. I felt like the wind was blowing me around, but it wasn't that at all. Tire pressure was about the same as it was coming down. I checked that several times. I did notice driving down it was 51 psi. Then when I started the trip back, I saw 48psi save one tired at 49psi. Odd. Then 15-20 minutes later into the trip, it was back up to 50 psi on all 4 tires. Odd. Either way, I stayed around 60-65 mph speed limit because the swerving was getting scary. I did about 75-80 on the trip down to Savannah, and about that starting back until the swaying/swerving got worse. I had my 8 month old baby daughter in the car, so I was stressed the entire 5 hour trip back home, paranoid I would lose control. I was emotionally drained when I got home. I was distraught and depressed after realizing I just bought a gigantic LEMON! And I hardly expect the dealership to do a thing! This has all just happened, so we will see how HYUNDAI OF KENNESAW decides to HANDLE this one. I will go in person later today to see if they will do anything to make this right.Update from Mar 30, 2016:The dealership has been working with me beatifully on this. Too bad the Hyundai brand steering is so strange. The swerving issue has not recurred; but the car cannot maintain a straight line without constant correction of the wheel.

Driving home from the dealership, I noticed the steering wheel would shudder and vibrate as the wheel returned to center after a turn. It does not do this all the time, but it suggests there is an issue with the steering column or worse; the steering rack. If there is slipping going on in the steering column or rack, it could be dangerous, as the vehicle could have difficulty steering, or lose the ability completely when in Drive. Hyundai should figure out what is causing this shudder, and issue a TSB along with a recall to address this complaint which a lot of consumers are reporting.",Santa Fe Sport 2.4L,2017

If it hadn't been Saturday afternoon, I would have brought it back immediately but I still thought it was because it was slippery outside. That was last Saturday. It is now one week and 3 days later and it still shudders, no more ice outside, but it does it over bumps as well, so I will be bringing it back to the dealership to see what they have to say about it.It does not leave a confident feeling when you're driving and your steering starts to shudder for no reason.

The on 3 separate occasions, a new steering column was installed. Then they got the manager of the service  dept to get involved, and he actually found the same vehicle a Santa Fe SPORT model, and when i drove it, the steering wheel shuddered coming out of a turn just like mine did.

772,accessories-interior,seats,AZ,USA,Jul 04,hyundai,Santa_fe,2017.0,"2,700 miles","In the affected vehicle, the wires in the can wiring harness assembly and airbag wiring harness assembly may be damaged by the passenger seat's height adjuster mechanism. A metal 3rd party power inverter was positioned underneath the passenger seat. Prior seat adjustments caused the sheath around the harnesses to become bare, exposing the electrical wiring. The metal power inverter become lodged against the wiring causing a short in the wiring and causing the entire vehicle's electrical system to fail. The epb (electronic parking break) became engaged and it was impossible to drive the vehicle. Although acknowledge that the 3rd party power inverter was under the seat, the vehicle had been driven 4 times with it under it, totaling less than 800 miles. It is not known how long it would take for that box to rub against the sheath on the harness and bare the wiring, therefore it is suspected that the power seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare and that recall #141 safety campaign #16V145000 may not have been properly resolved. We believe the seat adjuster caused the wires to become bare, prior to the inverter being placed under the seat. The inverter was positioned such that it wasn't making contact with the bare wire, until the seat was adjusted on 7/2/2017. The car was not driven on 7/3/2016. The incident occurred on 7/4/216 as the vehicle was driven across railroad tracks. It is believed the inverter was then jarred against the bare wire, causing the short. The dealership has not validated this; they are suggesting it was the inverter that caused the wires to become bare. Our opinion is that the inverter was not there long enough to cause that wiring to become bare. It wasn't until I discovered this previous recall that everything started to make sense. It is a $5,300 repair because the other wires involved that are bare are for the airbags.-Phoenix, AZ, USA",Santa Fe,2016

I inquired at the dealership and they said to keep an eye on it and if it continued, I was to bring it in and have it attended to. Started to pay more attention to it when my wife complained about the same thing. It became progressively worse (especially turning corners and when the vehicle had not been used for a longer period - like overnight) so I had booked a test drive with a technician who was able to replicate the hesitation. I competed the first service on the vehicle early (5736 klms) so they could look at the hesitation issue at the same time they did the service. They said there was no mechanical issue but said the safety feature with the vehicle ie: when the vehicle felt like it would lose traction, the power would be reduced. I said this was a safety issue but mine not the vehicle! When I need power, I need power to get me out of a situation which may cause an accident! I was advised to accelerate more slowly (!) and if it continued, I could bring it back and they would look at it again. I will be bringing it back again - when you pay this much money for a vehicle, you would expect it to power up when you need it to power up.

I had a similar problem with a Chevrolet a few years back (though not as scary as this). It was simply a design flaw on a computerized transmission which they did nothing to correctI'm just curious on how this could be allowed by our federal government.

I've done a little investigating and found that the hesitation is from the car down shifting from 3rd gear to 2nd gear. Now most cars when down shifting will have a very slight interruption in acceleration in some cars you might not even notice but the hesitation in the 2017 Santa Fe is so abrupt that it moves your whole body back and forward. This hesitation can also be dangerous, I approached an intersection and slowed down to between 10 and 15 mph and then tried to accelerate through the intersection the car down shifted from 3rd gear to 2nd gear as it should but the down shift took too long and left me in the intersection for a second or two longer than I should have been making the cars coming from the opposite direction dangerously close. I called the dealership at 200 miles and told them about this problem they told me to continue driving the car because the computer in the car is learning how you drive. I continued to drive the car and at 1000 miles it still had the hesitation so I brought it into the hyundai dealership. As I said this is an intermittent problem and it only happened once during the test drive with the mechanic while he was turning the car. He told me that it might be the traction control. When we got back to the dealership he said no code lights came on so there wasn't much he could do so he reset the computer and told me to continue to drive the car. I shut the traction control off and the hesitation continued so at 2000 miles I took the car to another Hyundai dealership the mechanic test drove the car by himself and he said he didn't see anything wrong I then test drove the car with the service manager and the hesitation only happened once. His response was that this was the way the the car was designed and it seems like I just don't like the way the car shifts and since no code lights came on there wasn't much he could do. I am extremely mad you would think that a car that has a sticker price between 42,000---44,000 dollars would have a flawless transmission cars costing thousands of dollars less have a smoother transmission. Now there is a lot that I like about the 2017 Sante Fe so I'm hoping that this hesitation resolves itself on its own as the car continues to break in or hopefully Hyundai sends out a computer update that fixes the problem I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this issue and I have considered taking a loss and trading the Sante Fe in for a Honda pilot.
