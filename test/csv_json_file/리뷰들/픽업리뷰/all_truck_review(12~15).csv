Paid almost exactly for the Tacoma what I paid for the Tundra two years ago (approx $37,500). I have driven Tundras since 2008 and loved them but I thought downsizing would be good since I rarely used the Tundra's full size capability and only averaged 15 MPG for mostly highway driving.  So the Tacoma looks good and has a smaller engine, so I guessed better mileage and ease of parking at Wal-Mart.  I have driven it about 800 miles so these are my first impressions.  Driver seat is VERY uncomfortable for me and I can't adjust it to fit me properly.  I am 5' 10"" and 200 lbs.  THERE IS NO POWER DRIVER SEAT.  My wife's Honda CRV has a power memory seat for gosh sakes!!.  C""mon Toyaota. Wake up to who is buying this vehicle.  Printed pattern on the seats looks like a design from the 1980's.  The engine is my other complaint.  Again, I am used to the big V-8 Tundra, but the Tacoma just feels under powered.  When you push down on the gas pedal it seems like it has to downshift to go faster, or entering the highway seems to tax it's capabilities.  Mileage so far is about 18MPG while I expected at least 20.  The electronics and navigation are easy to use.   If you want one, take it on a much longer test drive than I did.  I regret my decision to buy this vehicle. Next time I would look at the Colorado, and I hate any GM product and have told my wife to shoot me if I ever even considered a GM product.  Please Toyota, help save my life and upgrade the Tacoma!","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 0}",Disappointed,1499098773398.0,2.0,"{'valueRating': 1.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'TERRIBLE', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'TERRIBLE', 'resaleValue': 'EXCELLENT', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,toyota,tacoma,2015.0

Let me first begin by saying I am a very understanding and patient person when it comes to having realistic expectations with a product, such as a brand new truck.  But this ordeal I am about to share with you has resulted in me losing all faith with a corporation like Toyota.  Over the course of the last year of owning this vehicle I have spent days upon days driving to and from the car dealer for over 7 warranty issues, and as of recent an 8th that will need to be addressed.  95% of the trips were to and from AutoNation in Denver(over 1.5 hour each way), the dealer in which I bought it from, and consisted of sitting there and waiting for my vehicle each and every time up to 7 hours each day.  This has resulted in an exorbitant amount of time off work, wasted gas, wasted time, has substantially impaired market value on the truck, and not to mention has begun causing severe headaches and sleepless nights due to the level of frustration this has caused over the last 16 months.  
It¡¯s not just one system, it has been numerous, and still the truck does not operate like a Tacoma should after all this time.  I have had issues with the following components; the clutch pedal, door seals(both would SCREAM when I would drive 65+ or it was the slightest bit windy outside), shifter boot, navigation head unit, head rest, severe ¡°Clunk¡± sound/feel when stopping, and a faulty low 4 wheel drive.  All separate issues that I have had to address on the brand new Toyota I purchased a little over 1 year ago. 
Among all of the issues, the most severe issue this truck still has is a ¡°clunk¡± sound and feel that occurs after coming to a stop.  It literally feels like someone hit me from behind.  Toyota mechanics have recognized this is not normal and have taken the steps to fix the issue including the replacement of the entire drive shaft, trouble shooting the electrical connectors at the transfer case, and NOW after a year Toyota's rep is claiming this ¡°Clunk¡± is a normal characteristic.  At two different dealers, I have had their two lead technicians (one being a mechanic for 26 years with Toyota) recognize this as a defect, and have taken steps to eliminate the ¡°Clunk¡±.  At the latter of the two dealers, the service manager, that Scott Riel(Toyota¡¯s rep) set me up with, sat in my car to experience the clunk, and looked at me in horror, vehemently tell me this clunk is not normal. He then had his lead technician (Warren) get in the truck to experience the ¡°Clunk¡± only to look at me in shock and say ¡°You¡¯ve been dealing with this for 14 months on a brand new truck?! I am so sorry!¡±  Warren spent the next 30 minutes experiencing the clunk while I would put the truck into 1st gear, drive six inches, stop, and continue to say he never has heard such a sound on a Tacoma.  Fast forward a few weeks later when Toyota's rep inspected the vehicle.  Contrary to what 2 separate dealers thought, the Toyota rep is now taking the stance ""all Tacomas in this model experience the same clunk"" as I do when stopping.  When sharing with two other Tacoma owners(who have the same model as I do), Toyota¡¯s ruling that the clunk is ¡°fuel slosh¡±, they are as appalled as I am as neither of their vehicles exhibit this ¡°normal characteristic¡± supposedly all Tacomas have.  And if this characteristic was in fact normal, why would a Toyota technician of 26 years, not recognize this before replacing the entire drive shaft to try and fix the issue?  Furthermore, why wouldn¡¯t the service manager or lead technician, in a totally separate dealer, recognize this as normal when they work on Tacomas daily?  They both recognized this as ABNORMAL before trying to diagnose and fix the issue.  Today I made an attempt to contact Toyota one last time to see if they would agree to replace the fuel tank with one that doesn't allow fuel to build in momentum when I come to a stop, causing enough force to result in my truck jerking forward like someone hit me from behind.  They declined, indicating that because the Field Technician deems this a normal characteristic, they would not be willing to address this issue any longer.  I strongly caution you before you decide to buy a Toyota.  I never thought in my wildest dreams that Toyota, of all companies, would try scamming people into buying a model with known issues, and then take the stance these are ""normal"".  

So here I am with a truck that continues to clunk anytime the fuel is half filled or more.","{'thumbsDown': 2, 'thumbsUp': 11}",A 16 Month Nightmare,1493301419862.0,2.0,"{'valueRating': 3.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,toyota,tacoma,2015.0

I don't pull trailers or haul heavy loads, but I do occasionally carry bulky stuff like firewood (1/2 cord) furniture, or yard stuff (fertilizer, mulch, etc).  I LOVE this truck...it's perfect.  4WD is perfect in ""bad"" weather like mud/snow/ice.  Never been stuck or even thought about it.   A little tight with two adults in front and two car seats in back, but very manageable.  Engine has adequate umph, but I wish it had more (of course).  Stock tires were underwhelming so I changed to BFG KO2's...which hurt the MPG a little.  I get 17 MPG (mostly city).   The build is solid.  Doesn't feel ""plasticy"" like Chevy Colorado.  Reliability is great...I'm easy on the miles, but I've never had to put a wrench to it, only scheduled maintenance. 

*** UPDATE - Still perfect truck.  28K miles - runs better now than when I bought it.  Love the Blue Tooth/iPhone and iTunes compatibility.  Wish list: 1) quieter - but I added off-road tires.  2) really don't care for the ""weather app."" I really prefer an on-board thermometer. 3) moon roof.  4) better MPG...I don't put many miles and I cost myself some mileage with the off-road tires.  But I still wish it got more.  5) TRD super-charger - Toyota discontinued these.  I know there are other aftermarket S/C's.  But I want Toyota.  I think that aftermarket kills the warranty?  6) push button start.  7) auto rear sliding window  8) leather heated seats. 

Bottom Line - I love it and would totally buy it again.  

SECOND UPDATE - Still love my '14 Tacoma, but traded at 35K miles (lease was up) for a '17 Tacoma Pro.  I cannot say enough good things about my '14 Tacoma.

I still own it in October of 2016.  There are two design flaws and one other issue with this truck.  The two design flaws are: 1. There are two rubber strips across the top of the truck that come loose in strong wind or at the car was.  I'm not exactly sure why these two rubber strips are on top of the truck in the first place.  They don't seem to do anything except come off the truck.  2.  The painted on descriptions of the controls.  For example ... POWER on the radio knob.  These painted on descriptions come off over time since they weren't recessed into the dash then painted so you couldn't touch the paint.  In my opinion if they were just recessed without painting they would look better.  So the descriptions of the knobs will come off over time due to touching them.  The other issue is towing and the shifting of gears.  I towed a UTV on a utility trailer.  I could not use the cruise control when towing this UTV because the RPM's would go too high.  Even without towing something the shifting takes a while at higher speeds (60+ MPH) when getting on the highway.  Once it does finally shifts gears lowering the RPM's it's fine.  I love the way my Tacoma TRD looks and handles, but there are issues that keep it from getting a 5 star rating that could have been caught in the design of this vehicle.  I would recommend this truck but not if you want to tow something at it's maximum towing capacity and as long as you are OK with it's design faults.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 2}",Good truck with some issues.,1477498376469.0,4.0,"{'valueRating': 4.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'EXCELLENT', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,toyota,tacoma,2013.0

First the brakes are grabby sometimes at start up during cold weather. I plan on upgrading the brakes with quality drilled and slotted rotors with premium brake pads soon. Second when in 4wd low there is an alarm that goes off the entire time you have 4wd low selected. Very annoying! The truck is very off road capable and in my opinion the off road version rates up there with the  Jeep Rubicon! I really love this truck and get a lot of compliments on it. My wife has a 2016 Limited 4runner and the brakes are perfect on it so Toyota has improved them. We have owned several makes and models and have had the best service with Toyota brands!  The last four Toyota vehicles we have owned and sold over the years we made money on or got what we paid for them minus basic maintenance costs. We take very good care of our vehicles and have not had any trouble selling our previous used Toyota's!  We live in a mountainous area and all the bear hunters use Toyota Tacoma 4wd trucks due to their bullet proof reliability and go any where abilities even with 300k miles on them!  Take care of them and they will last!  If I could have only one truck it would be a Toyota with out a doubt! We work hard for our money and want a trouble free vehicle that is still worth something in ten years.

SB (2.7L 4cyl 4A),,{},"I find it hard to believe how many people have blind loyalty to these trucks. There are countless issues with them if you just look them up on forums and blogs. I have most of the problems people complain about: Drive line vibrations, brake shutter, wheel shutter, loud dashboard creaks and rattles. The whole truck shakes like crazy when I try to accelerate hard from a dead stop. The engine is chirping like there's a belt problem. The valves clatter when the water temp is cold. I practically have to wait for the water temp to get to normal running level before it stops. I love the truck and I want to keep it forever, but I get the feeling it either won't hold up or I'll grow to resent it.
***Update:  It has been 4.5 years, 87,500 miles and not much has changed.  The belt noise wasn't the belt at all.  No one could figure it out.  Dealer charged me for belt replacement and when that didn't fix it, they tried to tell me it was the A/C compressor.   Not until I took the truck in for a recall to replace the catalytic converter did the noise go away.  Valves still clatter and click when cold.  Driveline vibration is just as bad if not worse and now I hear what I think are the u-joints chirping.  There's also a gear whine coming from powertrain.  Sound like the differential.  There's now mildew in the window guides on every door.  After a rain, it's putrid.   The windshield wipers started to howl like crazy.  They start relatively quiet, but when you drive a while in the rain they get louder and louder.   Been on my third set of different tires.  Different brand, different style and no tire store can balance the wheels.  I've isolated it to one wheel, but no one can figure it out because it shows balance.  Took the wheel off the truck and had it looked at for a possible bend or some sort of irregularity, but there's nothing wrong with it.  I remember having this problem within the first month of ownership.  Dealer kept the truck for weeks to figure it out.  One day they told me it was their machine.  Had to send it next door to Lexus for balance.  Problem was gone.  Next set of tires, same problem.  Live with it until the next set where I purchase very, very expensive, high quality Michelin's.  Same problem now a different wheel.  Took the truck to a vibration specialist.  They load balanced all the wheels at 80mph and the problem went away.  Ask the tech why this is so critical and why so expensive.  He says some vehicles are prone to it.  It's a characteristic of the car/truck.  It's expensive because there are only two places in town to get it done:  His place and Lexus.  Wow! it all makes sense now.  Point is: Toyota is well aware these trucks have issues, so why do anything about it?  They still have little competition.  Plus, they are riding on the coat tails of loyal customers, good word of mouth and long term reliability.  Well, all I can say is nothing else has broke on the truck so far, but I've own lots of cars past 150-200K miles and honestly, once you get past 100K, they tend to all hold up comparably.  I've had Honda, Kia, Chevy, Ford, Mitusbishi and VW.  The two cars I've had the fewest problems with and kept the longest?  Kia, Mitsubishi and Honda in order of most mileage.  Toyota in my opinion is nothing special.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 7}",Too many quirks,1491430481777.0,3.0,{},0.0,toyota,tacoma,2013.0

SB (2.7L 4cyl 4A),,{},"I had been driving a 1994 Toyota pickup for 17 years and decided to trade for a new one.
I was sure it would be another Toyota, and spent quite a bit of time deciding which model to get.
I'm hopeful that my research might help others in deciding what to buy.

I mostly drive the truck back and forth to work, so it was important to get a comfortable vehicle that is fun to drive.
The SR5 package has more comfortable seats in my opinion and a nicer interior, so I got the SR5 package.
The 4-cylinder has plenty of power for me.
The truck is quiet and comfortable and I enjoy driving it.


I've owned the truck for 4.5 years now and it has 35k miles on it.  It has been flawless as far as reliability.  There was one recall for something in the exhaust system, but otherwise all I've done is change the oil and filters.  

I've used the truck to haul brush and yard waste, furniture, recycled and small loads of lumber.  For hauling, a shorter truck like this is easier to load and unload than a tall truck.  Other guys, with full sized trucks can't reach over the side of the bed to load and unload and have to crawl up into the bed of the truck.  I'm 5'10"" and can load and unload mine a lot easier.  For hauling, I think this is a better choice than getting the 4WD chassis, which is about 4 inches taller, or a full sized truck.  Starting in 2016 this shorter chassis is no longer available.  The shorter chassis doesn't look as good as the 4WD chassis, especially with the smaller steel wheels and tires.  But from a practical viewpoint it is a better truck.

The 2.7 4-cylinder is a little underpowered.  It is ok, but around town and on the highway I wish it had a little more power.  It handles good for a truck and is reasonably quiet on the highway as far as wind noise.  

The front seats are fairly comfortable.  The rear jump seats are crowded and uncomfortable - for short trips only, but a lot better than not having a rear seat when you need it.  I keep ropes and bungees in the floor of the rear for tying stuff down.  The rearview camera is in the rearview mirror.  The radio/cell phone interface was easy to learn to use.","{'thumbsDown': 2, 'thumbsUp': 30}",Good Truck,1500648855046.0,4.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'purchaseCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'resaleValue': 'EXCELLENT', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,toyota,tacoma,2013.0

This truck was built for it's year '12, of course fuel economy wasn't great back in the year but fuel at that time was cheap as well.  This style reminds  me of my time, when I was younger, so it brings back alot of memories.  It's not the High tech/push the button on warm seats/easy smooth turns, etc etc plz people it's a truck that will do the job when needed.  To save gas on long distance hwy (put the gear in 4-D drive, it will save you gas (around 22-24 mph).  In the city well that's different (can put you at 16-18, all depends on how you drive, right).  As for metal to the pedal, me personally it picked up quick and felt the power/jerk on this baby.  Long bed vs Short bed: long bed you get a better smoother ride when accelerating compare to the short bed. Long Bed you have a better balance and you can put more items in the back.  I'm an old school kind of guy and this truck fits the year it was built.. people these days want old school trucks to be like luxury and well, they should either sell it and get a more of there style truck.  I had the option to get a '17 or '16, but body style was different, remember (for those who knows) '12 was the beginning of a new body style change for Tacoma and it was also a change of technology as well.  So... it comes down to this: great truck, it has the power (long bed) I have the TDR sport and so far at 80k now.. i havent had any issues...","{'thumbsDown': 1, 'thumbsUp': 2}",Oldie but Goodey..

I had broken my ankle and it was a little more difficult to get into the Silverado because of its height so I buckled down and bought the Colorado with a Crew Cab. Beautiful looking truck that seemed to ride nice on the Test Drive. The next day I had this weird feeling that I shouldn't have traded, but I really didn't know why. My first trip to my dad's house which is an hour and a half from me on hills and winding turns, it handled really great but it wasn't shifting right. The dealer didn't know why at first but was willing to try to find out why. I was going to try to keep it awhile to get it paid down but then several recalls later and many visits to the dealership, it just cost me money. The dealership was 30 minutes away so even with the warranty's I still spent a lot in gas going back and forth from the dealership. The gas Mileage wasn't as good as it should have been compared to the Silverado. I got almost the same gas mileage. I was missing my Silverado more and more every day. I was leaving my job one day after a hard day's work and I threw the truck in Reverse to back out of my spot and then I went into drive and that's when the Gearshift just fell off, I mean completely off. I had no gears but that, so I had to go straight to the dealership, I couldn't back up or anything. They fixed it and gave me a car to drive, and then later I had to have my dash and cameras replaced. The shifting seem to get worse the longer I had it and then it started using oil. The oil was 2 quarts low at time of change. The straw that broke the camels back was the AC. It worked great but the line that goes from the AC Pump to the vents was corroded and ended up causing mold to form behind the dash which smelled so bad that I almost vomited the day I decided enough is enough. I have always been a Chevy fan and I still am but I have not had a good experience with this truck. I went out on June 30th and traded it in for a 2017 Silverado. I must say that I believe I'm going to be happy again. I didn't have that feeling the next day like I did with the Colorado. I didn't know why I had that feeling but I think there was something to it. Would I recommend this truck?...If you want a smaller truck that looks good and has a good stereo then yes I would, but if you want quite in the cab as well as smooth shifting and more comfort and reliability, then no I would not.

I bought my 2015 Colorado becuase I was tired of maneuvering my 2013 Silverado in town and getting just 15.5 MPG. The Colorado still has a 6 foot 2 inch bed, however it is over 15 inches shorter and 6 inches narrower than the fullsize pick-up. Just enough smaller to let the mid-size truck fit into normal parking spaces with some room to spare. The handling and braking are quite good and the 3.6L engine can make the Colorado move quite well, thank you. I drive the truck,not baby it and get very good fuel economy 21.8 mpg average (MPG dropped a bit now as I replaced the OE tires at 30K with a set of Wrangler Adventure W/Kevlar) in combined driving and up to 26mpg on the highway using 89 Octane gas. My single biggest complaint is the front seats. They are built for short, narrow framed occupants. Also, whey does a truck need a console mounted shifter to take up valuable space? A column shift would be much better. I am impressed with the build quality of the body. My Silverado was full of dash rattles and dour squeaks at just 15K while the Colorado has remained tight and noise free even at 30K. The paint job could be better as it has some visible tiger striping in the metallic. This seems to be a common defect on GM's robot painted vehicles. The 4x4 system and Eaton locking rear differential provide very good traction and the traction/stability control works quite well without being overly intrusive. I removed the nearly useless rear seats to gain more in cab storage. Only children would fit back there and I don't have any. If you are planning on hauling more than two people-buy the Crew Cab. All things considered, I really like my 2015 Colorado and would buy one again. These trucks are definitely worth a serious look.","{'thumbsDown': 1, 'thumbsUp': 5}","Solid, Fun to Drive, Easy to Live With.",1497276027750.0,4.0,"{'valueRating': 4.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'EXCELLENT', 'maintenanceCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'EXCELLENT'}",0.0,chevrolet,colorado,2015.0

But, this season we are back to the same problems as last year.  We are also experiencing the same problems as others with the vehicle shuddering as you try to accelerate while already moving.  Of course this is after you press down on the accelerator and nothing happens...until it downshifts and throws you back in your seat.  Really not impressed with the gas mileage either.  Small truck with 6 cyl should do better.  Thought about trading it in on a full sized truck...Best offer is $6,000 less than we paid.

It's only a couple hundred dollars more and it brings the truck from being a mild mannered ""daily commuter"" with some capability, to a truck that that will give many half-ton pickups a run for their money.  There is nothing more embarrassing than when I smoke these fully loaded $35,000+ Z71 Chevy Colorado's on highway with my $25,000+ work truck because I got the V6 and they don't.  

The extended cab versions are good for fitting extra passengers in a pinch but your friends will thank you for getting the crew cab option especially if your friends are large.  This truck was engineered almost perfectly.  The interior is tough and durable.  There are a lot of hard plastics inside (at least in my truck) but they do not lend themselves to a cheap feeling, rather more of a durable feeling.  Everything inside the truck feels hard and durable with no delicate nobs or buttons which is a huge plus for me.  Everything feels sturdy as it should.  The cabin's interior has a water resistant quality with rubber buttons and nobs that gives one the impression that the trucks electronics would be fine even if the inside got wet.  The acceleration for the truck is quite quick but the automatic transmission is a little....lazy.  It doesn't seem to want to kick the tranny into high gear unless you really put you foot through it.  This truck is most at home cruising on the highway and it is not interested in beating other motorists off the line; even though it certainly can.  This is partially a good thing because it encourages the aggressive driver to ease up a little and saves on MPG.  The trick to going fast (and then some) with this truck is to shift into manual mode and down shift.  Getting in and out of traffic with this truck is a breeze.  This truck can tow with the best of them but it can also (dare I say it) weave in and out of traffic in ways that larger trucks wouldn't dare.

Every 3.6L Chevy Colorado truck owner knows that they are own something very special.  The small attention to detail is what makes this truck an outstanding choice for mid-sized truck buyers.  This truck brings legitimacy to the mid-sized truck segment and has set the bar for what a Mid sized truck means.  Midsized trucks will no longer be known as trucks whose sole purpose is to haul tools and ladders,they are now a serious option for truck drivers looking to do real work.

Whats great about this truck is its versatility.  It can be used to tow an RV, plow snow, climb a hill, haul cement, go on a date, and race another truck all in one day!  The Chevy Colorado really can do it all.  This truck also gives you a great deal of confidence when you ride it and when you use it.  It's hard to feel   Whether you want a truck for a daily commuter or to do serous work this truck is really the best of both worlds.","{'thumbsDown': 1, 'thumbsUp': 8}",A BIG truck in a SMALL body....... win win,1458665189894.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'EXCELLENT', 'maintenanceCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'purchaseCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'resaleValue': 'EXCELLENT', 'warranty': 'EXCELLENT'}",0.0,chevrolet,colorado,2015.0

I elected to get the 6-cylinder engine because I felt that the 4 would be under powered, and there was just 1 mpg difference in fuel economy between the engines.  I don't regret either decision.  The Colorado is a great work truck, with adequate power, and it's quiet.  I'm looking forward to getting years of use from it.  Already, in the first year, I've hauled gravel, mulch, sand, paving stones, wood chips, and cardboard in it. 

I also have used it on a week-long camping trip, after purchasing an air mattress that fills the truck's bed, a tent that fits over the truck bed, and another tent that attaches to the first and sits on the ground behind the truck bed.  I really appreciated the driving position of the truck  when I drove for 11 continuous hours to my camping destination.

Additionally, the gas mileage of the 2.5L engine and 6 speed automatic transmission is great ( routinely 27.5 to 30 mpg highway) for the size of this truck.
  Update 8/23/16 -- After 6+ months of ownership I still love this truck. Yesterday my wife and I took our 2 grandkids (ages 9 and 12) on a 1 hour trip. Everybody was comfortable, Pandora entertained and the trip gas mileage was 30 mpg. The ride and handling is still terrific with great visibility and a big vehicle ""safe feel"" when traveling. Now all 4 of us prefer to take this truck vs our car for trips. I am still very impressed with this vehicle.
  Update 12/10/16 --- Now as the northern Ohio winter starts we are still very impressed with all of the ""handiness"" and features this truck. It still has the original ride and handling feel, great gas mileage on trips and now the heated seats feel really nice.  Another side advantage is the used vehicle pricing of this truck vs my previous car ( my old car's value has dropped over $2,500.00 since it was traded while my truck's value is the same). This truck is still the best bang for the buck on the market. We plan on keeping it a long time !

The look of the Colorado is excellent. I think it is a very attractive truck.  The options are great also. The one that I owned was loaded with all of the bells and whistles. The Dealership and Service Department was great also. (I just had to see them too much.)
Now the bad:
I also experienced the crazy shifting and total under powering of the truck as mentioned in other posts (The one I owned had the 6 cylinder in it). Several safety recalls, and having the torque converter changed out at 3,600 miles to try to correct the shifting problem, left me very disappointed in the Colorado. The dealer that I worked with was very understanding when I informed them that I did not buy a new vehicle to stay in the Service Department. I had an old car that was paid off if this was what I was interested in.  Unfortunately, I decided to trade the truck in on a different vehicle. I had the truck 8 months, and felt like I would be better off just getting rid of the headache. Hopefully Chevrolet will get the bugs worked out in the coming years, but they totally missed the mark on this truck.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 8}",Very Disappointed,1451496945988.0,2.0,"{'valueRating': 2.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,chevrolet,colorado,2015.0

It will randomly shift between gears when driving on a flat plane.  It will drop down 2 gears when you try to pass another vehicle, resulting in the RPM's to redline and the MPH not even increasing all while jerking you around the cab.  I also purchased the leather - fully adjustable seats which leaves much to be desired.  The seat will only lower so far and of lowering farther, it will just lean back resulting in a very uncomfortable sit and blind spots from the rear view mirror.  I would not recommend anyone to buy one of these trucks without test driving it for at least a full 24 hours in every imaginable scenario you would ever be in.

Ive almost ripped that thing off on curbs. You want me to get this thing stuck Ill come back missing half the damn plastic just from my normal hiking spot. I asked the dealership hey can you take that off? His reply was "" Oh you wanted to take this truck off road""? Well it might void your warranty? Really? Because the whole reason I bought this damn truck was to get to the trailheads I couldn't get to with my damn foreign car! Im Legitimately concerned about my truck making it to the 60 month mark.

The new Colorado does this in spades. To keep weight and complexity down, as well as cost, the extended cab and 4-cyl was our best choice. 

The 4-cyl is very smooth and quiet as long as you are not in a hurry. If you mash the pedal or like to drive fast then this is not for you. Around town it keeps up with traffic, it is not designed for towing heavy loads over mountain passes. 

The new build quality is outstanding, looks very euro or japanese under the hood. The ride is very smooth and it's amazingly quiet. 

This one is a home-run.

EDIT: Edmunds sent out a request to re-visit and update my review after two years with the vehicle. I'm still just as impressed with this as the day I bought it, it has been very good. 

There have been three or four minor recalls, and zero warranty claims. Absolutely no failures whatsoever. Fit and finish is excellent, no wear points. 

Some owners have complained about balky shifting, however I have found overall it works as designed - some fault the way it shifts up to a higher gear and locks up the TC to conserve fuel. If you're trying to mash the pedal and get it to shift down at the same time it can take longer than some expect. For around town driving I use manual mode and leave it in 4 or 5 so it cannot shift all the way to 6th. This solves that issue and it works very well otherwise. 

The I4 is no powerhouse, but it's adequate even on the freeway. We have since acquired a boat that is about 2500lbs on it's trailer - the truck easily pulls this load even on mountain grades. 

I just installed new all-terrain tires (Cooper Adventurer/Discoverer) as I wanted AT type tires from the beginning but could not get a reasonable trade in for the new take-offs, even when they were under 100miles. So after two years decided to just spend the money - it rides so much nicer than the GY Wrangler Fortitudes it comes with. 

All in all very happy with this truck. Oh, and have towed it a couple of thousand miles with the RV and it does just fine - absolutely zero issues. It has now traveled to four states and plenty of short-commuting miles.","{'thumbsDown': 1, 'thumbsUp': 11}",New Colorado X-Cab LT 4X4 w/I4,1487693144897.0,5.0,{},0.0,chevrolet,colorado,2015.0

This truck replaced a Nissan Frontier. I don't need a full size truck, so sadly my alma matter, Ford, was out as they killed off the Ranger 3 years ago. I have had the truck a week and like it. We drove a 700 mile trip through the mountains and averaged 23.5 mpg going 70 mph with 4 people and bed full. The Nissan on the same trip averaged 19.3 mpg. Truck is very quiet and comfortable. The fit and finish inside and out are first rate. I have not used the 4X4 or towed yet, but with 7000 lbs capacity it should do well. Overall, after a week and 1000 miles, I would recommend it. I was going to wait on the diesel, but after comparing potential costs vs. return, the gas V-6 was the better buy. 

Update 12/31/2016
The bad - I have owned this truck 2 years now and 27K miles, and sadly it has not been reliable and I just can't recommend the Colorado. It has been in a Chevy dealer for warranty repairs for over 35 days of the 2 years of ownership. Problems include, OnStar Module, 4WD electronic transfer case replaced twice, hood vibrating at highway speeds replaced twice and still has minor vibration, poor paint quality on roof, engine spark knocking under light load, transmission has higher pitched hum at 50-60 mph and hard shifting under light load, heater completely went out, A/C went out twice, ignition had to be replaced do the key getting so hot you could not touch it, brakes squeaking when cold, and the most annoying, a clicking sound in the steering column that GM engineering has yet to come up with a fix for that is related to the airbag, not to mention multiple recalls. The bright spot has been the dealer support, Autosport Chevrolet in Hackettstown NJ. They have been very helpful through all these problems and kept in contact with GM engineering to resolve most of the issues and I can't say enough good things about them!

The good - The reasons I purchased the truck have led me to want to try and keep it with the hopes that before the warranty period ends the issues will be resolved. It gets great mileage for a gas truck (been averaging 22.5 combined city/highway), its very comfortable, roomy and quiet. The infortainment and navigation are first rate. So if you decide to purchase a Colorado my recommendation is to buy the GM extended warranty. There are a lot of Colorado's on the road now and mine was one of the first ones produced, and the build quality was just not adequate, others have had good experiences with later production trucks.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 44}",First New Chevy,1483471988471.0,1.0,"{'valueRating': 2.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'EXCELLENT', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,chevrolet,colorado,2015.0

After owning it for well over a year now and putting 40,000 miles on it I have a better feel. The only thing that really sucks is I love driving this truck and the warranty is no longer valid since I have passed 32,000 miles which was supposed to last three years.

I commute 48 miles each way to work.  The gas mileage is on average about 16MPG.  I purchased this truck for a couple of reasons.  After a bunch of negotiation, I got the price down to $27,300 which is about as low as it gets for a nicely loaded 4x4 truck.  You probably could do better due to every other manufacturer that makes one having an updated small truck.  The interior craftsmanship is poor.  The glove box/door panels are susceptible to scratching and the center console latch broke very early on.  I had the same issue with my wife's Nissan Quest.  The dash rattles.  The rear doors don't close well.  The seats are comfy (I'm 6'04"" - 240 lbs), seat warmers are nice and the web material is nice but the back seat is way too small for long trips with even small-medium sized passengers.  I have three kids and I shuttle them to and from school so it works out.  Longer trips, they are complaining.  The storage under the rear seat is nice.  I just got back from vacation and found a puddle of rain water inside the truck.  The antenna for the XM radio has come loose and water leaked into the truck from the roof.  Luckily, no headliner damage.  The dealer wouldn't fix it despite being 18 months old because of the mileage and neither will Nissan.  (Nissan has poor customer service.)  Oddly, it doesn't have an oil change meter.  I use the second trip odometer.  The truck runs wells, has good power.  For a rear wheel drive truck, it handles well.  The ABS works great (I had some evasive driving recently and was impressed.)  I have the rails in the truck bed and they are a nice option.  For what I paid for it, it works well.  When I added gasoline and maintenance estimates, it was by far cheaper than the Colorado or the Toyota.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 1}",Mixed bag but great bang for your buck.,1476807561263.0,3.0,"{'valueRating': 3.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'TERRIBLE', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'resaleValue': 'TERRIBLE', 'warranty': 'TERRIBLE'}",0.0,nissan,frontier,2015.0

I doubt that Nissan would qualify. The six cylinder engine has an iron block - but it has aluminum heads - so given the different rates of expansion/contraction, head gasket failure was inevitable, eventually.  The ""timing chain"" was much better than the ""timing belt,"" but Nissan has faulty timing gears and a poor rating for servicing what they build - another negative. After rationalizing these detriments, I could not get a manual transmission to go with the six cylinder engine, which soured the deal completely. Lastly, I was left wondering what the parts/repair situation would look like fifteen years from now, so I have opted out of ""new"" trucks, and I will be looking for something older that ""may"" be more durable and offer me a few more good years.

Its 4.0L engine will last for many decades if properly maintained. I love the leather interior, heated seats and outstanding stereo with navigation. The engine is very strong. The only draw back to this pickup, is its gas mileage, but the reliability of this pickup a long with its 6.1 foot long bed and great pricing made the choice easy. The frame under the pickup bed on the Frontier looks twice as stout as the new Chevy/GMC frame under their small pickup beds, and the Frontier has 4 wheel disc  brakes, you can't get that on the Toyota, and rear drum brakes are a real pain to maintain in the N.E.

I had a 06 Xterra (same platform) with 186000 trouble free miles on it. I traded for a loaded 12 pro4x xterra. I put 35000 miles on that in 1 yr. Now to the Frontier. I traded off the xterra as I needed to haul cans of gas and diesel for work.  My first experience is the truck is a little more bouncier than the xterra but not bad at all. gas mileage is less on the fronty as well. I avg about 18 on the fronty where 20 was the norm on the X. I'm Mr. cruise control and I keep a fuel record. I like everything about the fronty so far and the 8 way seat makes a long haul a non issue. I'm 49 and 6' 225 muscular build and I feel fine behind the wheel. I just wish they would add a telescoping wheel to the list on the next gen. as well as the diesel. I haven't had the chance to off road the frontier but I am sure it is as capable as the Xterra and it was quite the mountain goat. I have hauled my ZRX1200R a couple of times in the bed. Although it is a little short the rail system is awesome. I also have towed my M109R on my Kendon trailer and it pulls with ease. Probably around 1200 pounds. I did notice some mileage drop off though, which I never saw on the xterra while pulling my bike. I would also like to add that these trucks hold their value well . So in closing these are some things I would like to see on a new generation.
1. Bring on that diesel. I just came back from the Dominican republic and they have a diesel. What engine I don't know
2. Telescoping steering wheel
3. Keep the truck looking like a truck and not a damn crossover vehicle

As many have pointed out it's an old design and there are roomier and more modern competitors to consider. But in Pro-4X trim this old school truck becomes an off road warrior. Including the luxury package adds electronically adjustable leather seats with heaters, leather interior, sunroof, and a rugged roof rack.

For a truck that you're taking into the wilds, old school isn't a bad thing. The engine and drive system has been proven and improved upon over the past decade. The 4.0 V6 has power to spare, and the part time 4 wheel drive includes HI and LO ranges, locking rear differential, and hill start/hill descent control. I have no worries that this truck will take me there and back again without complaint.

Fit and finish are top notch. While the NissanConnect system doesn't like to play nice with an iPhone, the rest of the audio/navigation system works very well. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is as good as they come, with excellent sound quality and plenty of bass you can rock out while you're climbing over rocks and boulders.

This is my 3rd Frontier (and have had 2 Xterra's in the past) so I know what these trucks are capable of. When it came down to getting my next vehicle, and in light of the new Tacoma and Frontier's coming out at the end of the year, this was the truck I wanted. It provides the most bang for the buck and I know it's a solid investment that will last for many years of on and off road adventure. The new trucks will be nice, more luxurious, and a LOT more expensive. Do you really want to invest $40k on something that you intend to get down and dirty with? Not to mention that they'll be working out the kinks in the new models for a while.

UPDATE FEBRUARY 2017:
Nothing much to complain about after driving the truck for 18 months and almost 28,000 miles. The stock Hankook Dynapro ATM tires have grown a bit louder, but that seems to be the norm for all-terrain tires. Other than regular maintenance the vehicle has been perfect. Still rock solid, no rattles, fit and finish remain excellent. Maintenance costs have been extremely low, especially considering I only have it serviced at my local dealer. Not sure if the low cost is just for this dealer, or reflects generally low maintenance costs for this vehicle.

Offroad capabilities are as expected. Excellent. And on-road manners are quite civilized (other than the slight growl from the A/T tires). Mileage typically varies from 17.5 - 18.5 MPG.

The factory nav/audio system has an occasional glitch, and sometimes freezes up, but easily remedied by a hard reset of the system (holding down power button for several seconds). It may be somewhat overwhelmed trying to deal with the 10,000 songs on my iPhone.

Since purchasing the Frontier I've had the opportunity to review all the new truck models. While there are newer and more modern trucks available, the Frontier remains an excellent choice, offering as many (if not more) premium features for fewer dollars.","{'thumbsDown': 2, 'thumbsUp': 15}",A real honest truck!,1487090453045.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,nissan,frontier,2015.0

I'd badly injured my left foot in a falling accident and kicking the clutch was painful. I love Toyotas, but the price on the used Tacomas was too much for my budget. Enter a well-maintained 2014 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab with the SV package.  While not as big as the Tundra, the Frontier was quite comfortable and its automatic transmission and cruise control were blessings to my injured left foot. I also found the Frontier tracked well in its lane rather than wandering the way my Tundra had. The only fault was in the limited rear view along the driver's side of the car via the door-mounted rearview mirror. After a few hair-raising moments I learned to lean forward and look back along the driver's side of the truck to watch out for traffic. Once I got used to that it wasn't a problem. I love the 4.0 liter V6 engine, which offers 60-plus more horsepower than I had in my Tundra.  No more being left behind at the stop light by everybody else (including grandma). I bought the truck in December 2016 with just under 35,000 miles on it. I saved a good $8,000 to $9,000 compared to a new car. Do I see that as a great deal? Oh yes--Nissan trucks are made to last and I saved a lot more than I gave up by purchasing a late-model used pickup. The previous owners clearly maintained the vehicle well. Also, the built-in towing package is a plus as my wife and I--both in our 60s--are ready to trade tent-camping for the comforts of a trailer. The more I drive this truck, the more I like it. And while I would have preferred a gray-colored truck, the shiny black highlighted with chrome bumpers, sidesteps, etc., is definitely a ""sexy"" combination.

Purchased New 7/3/13, so far so good.  A very nice Truck, with lot's of power.  So far I get 20.6MPG Averaged, in mixed driveing, which is about the same that I was getting with a '93 Nissan KC 4 cylinder AT 2WD that I had purchased New 20 year's before.   No problem's after 2 year's as only vehicle.  I looked at and drove them all.  Came down to Tacoma, Siverado, But Nissan Frontier came out on top,, with Most Truck for the Money.

UPDATE @ 3 Years:   So far so good with no problem's.   One advice that I can give, is to not put these Truck's in Mud, Water, or Rough Off Roading.  I don't think these Truck's will stand up to that type of abuse.
So Far I'm Pleased with this 2013 SVV6 KC AT 2WD Nissan Truck.

UpDate 1/8/17:  So far so good.  It's the Best Truck so far, that I've ever owned.  Just got a fillup and got 21mpg mixed driveing.  Plenty of power to pull my utility trailer.  Take's curve's better than the '93 Nissan Truck that I had previously.  Truck is so Tight,, that it took about 8K Mile's to start limbering up.  So Far no problem's, and so far, it is a very good truck for the money.  If you get one, Stay out of the Mud, Water and any Rough Off Roading like some Dumb Punk's do that abuse their Truck's and don't care if their Truck will last and be dependable.

UpDate @ 4 Years 7/9/17:  So Far So Good.  Still the Best Truck so far that I've ever owned.  Am Averageing 20.4 MPG.  Steering was very tight in the beginning,, but limbering up nicely at almost 10 K Mile's.  Much better to be too tight than too loose.  Get you one now,, before this 2nd Generation Frontier is upgraded with a New Style Model, and enjoy saveing Money.  When the New Style Model come's out,, they'll have to pay for the New Style Cost's,, and they will cost you more.  Don't Put it in the Mud, Water, and Severe Offroading, Like Some Dumb Punk's do, if You Want Your Truck to Last and Be Dependable.  Remember this;  Marketing show's Severe Activitie's,, which a Pickup Truck is not intended for.  Remember those Commercial's showing Truck's Pulling Tree Stump's Out Of The Ground.  Don't be a Dumbo;  A Big 4 Wheel Drive Tractor can't even do that without first haveing to dig the Stump out with a Backhoe or Pushed over with a Bull Dozer before the Tree is Cut Off.  These are not Heavy Duty Truck's,, but if used according to the Owner's Manual, ie Transporting People, Cargo, and Pulling a Trailer within the Maximum Tow Rateing,, then I think that these Truck's will last a long time.  If you want the Paint to stay Nice and Shiney, use Meguiar's #6 Mirror Glaze Professional Cleaner/Polish/Wax Regularly.  Save Money and Get You One before the New Style Model come's out.","{'thumbsDown': 1, 'thumbsUp': 6}",2013 SVV6 KC AT 2WD,1499697968178.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'purchaseCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'resaleValue': 'EXCELLENT', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,nissan,frontier,2013.0

It handles great, rides smooth as one can reasonably expect a 4x4 pickup to (takes potholes in Northern Virginia like a champ), has a lot of get-up-and-go, and the interior is even more comfortable than my Tacoma was.

Needless to say, my Frontier didn't survive, but I got out of it with nothing more than a little whiplash and a mild concussion.

SB (2.5L 4cyl 5M),,{},"I just purchased my 4th Nissan Frontier. I traded in a Nissan D21 that I had for 25 years. My 2013 is a 4 cylinder, 5 speed, S model King Cab. It was priced about $3000 below a similar Toyota Tacoma.
The truck has crank windows, no power locks, and no Bluetooth. The first tank of gas I got almost 28 mpg in city and rural driving. On the second tank full I got 25 mpg. The secret is to shift around 2200 rpm. The truck is clunky and dated and simple transportation. For every 100 miles I drive this Frontier I save about $8 over the Tundra parked next to it in fuel costs.
UPDATE: My real work truck developed a cab leak and filled with water. The passenger side of the cab was never sealed from the factory. I purchased a new 2015 Frontier SV 4x4 crew cab and traded in the 2013 as after the leak the smell never went away. MY ADVICE, before buying check carefully the seams of the cab to be sure they are fully factory sealed. UPDATE: The manual transmission in the end proved to be too much shifting in Seattle traffic. The 2013 Frontier was traded for a new (2015) Frontier SV CC with an automatic transmission. The mileage on the new Frontier isn't as good as the 2013 S model Frontier but in traffic, mostly sitting, the automatic is great. In retrospect, looking back on the 2013 purchase, I should have bought the 4 cyclinder S model Frontier with an automatic transmission. My mistake. UPDATE:
The 2015 Frontier SV went into the dealer for the  14000 mile service. One of the items was ""replace cabin filter"". After the cabin filter was replaced I asked to see the old filter. I was told it didn't have one installed from the factory. So in summary : truck one the, 2013 Frontier S, didn't have the cab sealed from the factory.;  truck two, 2015 Frontier SV, didn't have the cabin filter installed.

The technology in the vehicle was out of date when it came off the production line, but I'm not the kind of guy who needs all the bells and whistles.  In fact, I really don't want to pay for them.

Prior to purchasing, I did plenty of research and test drove the old and new 2017 model.  In my opinion, the new 2017 model is just OK.  My personal preference is the old design.  Things like most:  car-like ride; comfort; tons of interior storage capacity and compartments; in-bed trunk (holds two sets of golf clubs); the mid-size makes it easy to maneuver (my wife has no problem driving it); traction in the snow; easy-to-use controls (knobs and buttons vs the new touch screen); gate swings to the side (very convenient).   Things where improvement could be made:  has no memory seat; poor radio reception; the ""on"" / ""off""  indicator for air conditioning setting is small and difficult to read; poor compass.  Extra accessories:  bed cover (keeps things dry and improves gas mileage); rubber bed mat for protection; cargo net (works great for holding cargo in place).       We have owned several Honda's.

When it came time to replace that truck I wanted to downsize a little.
I drove all of the smaller pickups in the market and found the Honda Ridgeline to be the right size, 4 wheel capability, smooth riding, relatively quiet, and fully capable for what I need in a pickup. Getting the Honda reliability was a plus. We drove it around town for the first 4K miles and it was a pleasure driving it in an urban setting, easy to park, great for those occasional trips to buy furniture, and good looking enough for date nights. You guessed it, I don't miss my F-150.  50000 + miles later and my Ridgeline is still driving like new. Have only done the scheduled maintenance including regular oil changes and new transmission oil. The tires are still great, the truck runs straight, nothing leaks, and I still love driving it each day. 
    Since I have purchased this vehicle a new designed model is about to be launched and I'm anxious to see it up close. I have grown accustomed to the ugly original look, and even though I think Honda missed the mark on a NEW design, it's still a Honda and it will always run better than it looks.
     
     The new 2017 Honda Ridgeline has come out now and Honda was able to give us something new and take away something at the same time.  They gave us a truck that resembles most other trucks on the market, they kept what works from the original Ridgeline, and added some new things to pay for.  It's not cool to have to pay for features once standard equipment, ie AWD and electric rear window.  The new Ridgeline is nice, but now since I have taken 3 years to get to like my Ridgeline, I like the old style just a little better.  Honda fell short on knocking my socks off with its new design, new colors, and new features.  The one thing Honda never falls short on is quality and the fact that Hondas just work and work well. I will eventually own a new Ridgeline, why not, they are a great vehicle, but my 2013 Ridgeline is still a great truck.  It runs well, looks good, drives the best, quiet, and reliable. It's a Honda.
     Well I've owned a driven my Ridgeline for about 67K miles and 4 years. Tires just got replaced, but everything else is still working great. Regular oil changes and filter changes is all I've done. This vehicle is not babied, we drive it hard and loaded on the highway, it spends several hours a day on gravel mountain roads and it sits out in the elements when it's parked in Florida. 
     I'm still not in love with its original styling and yet to feel the same about the new 2017 design, but I love how my Ridgeline just works quietly for me. I'll eventually buy a new one, but hope more design changes as well as better colors will be offered. Let's face it, the Ridgeline is an urban pickup. Make it look smart and give it great colors. The 2017 model is a weak start, keep up with greater design modifications.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 22}",I want to really love the Ridgeline styling.,1493308256457.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'TERRIBLE', 'maintenanceCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'EXCELLENT', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,honda,ridgeline,2013.0

There is always something breaking.  
-After 2 years the third brake light assembly broke off the truck on the highway.  It was out of warranty.  Honda USA was no help even though it is a pretty well documented problem on forums.  Quote from the dealer $800.  Radio never worked well, but found out the antenna was located in the third brake light assembly.  
- brakes are paper.  I do highway driving.  3 sets of brakes in 3 years.  I know it's operator influenced, but I've never had this in any other vehicle.
- left front axle blew out after 3 years.
- timing belt on a truck?  really.  My bad for not researching more thoroughly.  $900 along with spark plugs and valve adjustment due at the same time for an additional $600.
- virtually every oil change at is accompanied by either differential, transmission, or coolant change.  Why are other vehicles rated for 60-100K between fluid changes?

Seats are very rigid and uncomfortable for moderate to long rides.  The interior design is perplexing.  Why put the Aux cord input in the dash on the passenger side?  Also, the space below the middle console is wasted space.  You can't get to it without having everything from the top space fall into it. Interior seat material scratches very easily.

Update 05/16/17: The truck had more than 8 paint chips around the entire body. After doing some research I learned that GM vehicles (GMC, Chevy, Buick, etc.) have a history of paint chipping issues. Apparently, the primer GM uses is the problem. Regardless, my truck was still under the bumper to bumper warranty and it would have been a prolonged source of frustration and anxiety to get it taken care of to my (the customer) liking. GM only had one representative for my entire state (Maryland) so my situation worse. In December of 2016, I ended up trading in my truck for an F150: I took a hit financially but it was worth it. I won't buy another GM manufactured vehicle again and I will warn the people I know who are considering buying one about paint chipping issues.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 1}",Seating and Paint Job,1495028248549.0,3.0,"{'valueRating': 2.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'TERRIBLE', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,gmc,canyon,2015.0

This vehicle is OK,. but the dealer and manufacturer support is terrible.  I will not purchase another GM product for quite some time if ever again.  Transmission is very sluggish.  Location of drive selector (2W,4W) is bad. Easy to hit with your knees unless your 4 ft. tall.  Muffler sounds like a Toro with a hole in it, but dealer says this is normal.  I compared the 2016 Tacoma and 2016 Canyon closely and decided that for my purposes, the Canyon was more comfortable (driver head room and leg room) and used that as my main criteria.   On the highway the Canyon is pretty responsive and handles fairly well, but the  mileage is substantially lower than stated.   My biggest issue is the poor dealer support I got when I had to replace a rear center side glass.  Some bonehead tried to break in the truck through the rear slide glass (I guess?... there were no rocks, meteorites, or dead birds present when I returned from grocery shopping, but the center glass was totally knocked out). The response I got was that GM showed the part with a price, but they could not tell me if it was available or not.  All third party glass companies said it was only a dealer part.  After a week of waiting on the dealer (Ferguson GMC-Tulsa), they still could not tell me when or whether the part would be available.   GM needs to have their OEM vendors produce and stock replacement equipment for their vehicles for at least a few years, or until third parties can produce.  I cannot get the part from GM or anyone after 7 days.  My only options are to replace the entire for $900+ or put a cheap (non defrost solid piece of glass into it).  GM SUCKS and I will go back to Jap and German vehicles as much as possible. I currently own 6 vehicles between personal and business and business.  You would think that American manufacturers learned their lessons in the 70-80's from Japan, but maybe they just need to be govt. subsidized in order to function at the level of Toyota, Lexus, Audi, Mazda, etc.    No mention of ""bulletins"" by dealer when I purchased it.  The transmissions are going to be a big problem in this vehicle... beware.  GM will do everything in their power to hide and diffuse the issue... maybe like they did with the 124 deaths related to faulty  ignition switches that they knew about and covered up.","{'thumbsDown': 1, 'thumbsUp': 6}",Good Design But Poor GM Support,1470321243666.0,3.0,"{'valueRating': 3.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'TERRIBLE'}",0.0,gmc,canyon,2015.0

BOTTEM LINE I would buy the GMC Canyon again without hesitation.

The GMC Canyon is a nice looking and well built midsize pickup with a strong V6 engine and 7000 lb. towing.  The Canyon is less money that a full size V8 truck with better fuel economy. The Canyon is a good alternative to a full size pickup and a strong contender in the midsize market.",,"After much research, I decided on the GMC Canyon over a full size pickup.

With 1500+ miles on the Canyon, this is my take on the truck.

RIDE, a truck like ride that is smooth, firm and quite. HANDLING, confident and comfortable but a bit heavy at times.  ENGINE, strong V6, fuel efficient. TRANSMISSION, shifts smoothly and for the most part predicable. On strong acceleration or downshifting the transmission can have a hard shift at times. FUEL ECONOMY, first two tanks over 22.5 MPG (70% Highway) This is a little better than I expected. BUILD QUALITY, very good fit and finish and build quality over all. VALUE, good, the Chevy Colorado would be a better choice for some concerning value.
