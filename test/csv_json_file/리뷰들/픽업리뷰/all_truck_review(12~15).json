These should be made deeper since some folks have gotten ABS fault lights. You can remove the ABS fuse and still drive it, but then no ABS or Stabil-a-Track. It's not a major thing, but it does cost $300 to $500.

I'm pretty frustrated with having to replace weak leaf springs within 5k miles.  Bought new to stay out of the shop.  Wasting time and money now.","2":"Recently traded in my 2015 Tundra for a 2017 Tacoma TRD Off Road. Paid almost exactly for the Tacoma what I paid for the Tundra two years ago (approx $37,500). I have driven Tundras since 2008 and loved them but I thought downsizing would be good since I rarely used the Tundra's full size capability and only averaged 15 MPG for mostly highway driving.  So the Tacoma looks good and has a smaller engine, so I guessed better mileage and ease of parking at Wal-Mart.  I have driven it about 800 miles so these are my first impressions.  Driver seat is VERY uncomfortable for me and I can't adjust it to fit me properly.  I am 5' 10\" and 200 lbs.  THERE IS NO POWER DRIVER SEAT.  My wife's Honda CRV has a power memory seat for gosh sakes!!.  C\"mon Toyaota. Wake up to who is buying this vehicle.  Printed pattern on the seats looks like a design from the 1980's.  The engine is my other complaint.  Again, I am used to the big V-8 Tundra, but the Tacoma just feels under powered.  When you push down on the gas pedal it seems like it has to downshift to go faster, or entering the highway seems to tax it's capabilities.  Mileage so far is about 18MPG while I expected at least 20.  The electronics and navigation are easy to use.   If you want one, take it on a much longer test drive than I did.  I regret my decision to buy this vehicle. Next time I would look at the Colorado, and I hate any GM product and have told my wife to shoot me if I ever even considered a GM product.  Please Toyota, help save my life and upgrade the Tacoma!","3":"2017 limited, V6 AWD, top the line. Very poor (slow and jerky) acceleration.  You feel the engine working hard when RPM change from 2 to 3 to 4. Small slope requires high RPM. This is so different from my previous Lexus RX 330. The rear camera alarm stopped alarming within a month.  Will sell it.","4":"First of all - this is a truck, not a car, and certainly not a sports car. Capability, dependability, reliability, are all paramount in buying a truck. This truck excels in each category. Re-sale value far exceeds everything else in the class. Some buyers want the most electronic gadgets they can get, others want a bare bones no-nonsense \"less stuff to break\" type trucks. This truck falls in the middle somewhere. It's neither the most tech, nor the least. It rides great, shifts smoothly, provides a \"go anywhere - do anything\" driving experience. I don't find the seats to be low nor uncomfortable, YMMV. Drawbacks? I do get some noise from the passenger side door seal in high cross winds, I'll have the dealer look at it. That's about it. In summary, I'd buy the same truck again no questions asked. I think that speaks volumes of my recommendation.","5":"Please take this into consideration before you spend your money on a Toyota.  Let me first begin by saying I am a very understanding and patient person when it comes to having realistic expectations with a product, such as a brand new truck.  But this ordeal I am about to share with you has resulted in me losing all faith with a corporation like Toyota.  Over the course of the last year of owning this vehicle I have spent days upon days driving to and from the car dealer for over 7 warranty issues, and as of recent an 8th that will need to be addressed.  95% of the trips were to and from AutoNation in Denver(over 1.5 hour each way), the dealer in which I bought it from, and consisted of sitting there and waiting for my vehicle each and every time up to 7 hours each day.  This has resulted in an exorbitant amount of time off work, wasted gas, wasted time, has substantially impaired market value on the truck, and not to mention has begun causing severe headaches and sleepless nights due to the level of frustration this has caused over the last 16 months.  \nIt\u2019s not just one system, it has been numerous, and still the truck does not operate like a Tacoma should after all this time.  I have had issues with the following components; the clutch pedal, door seals(both would SCREAM when I would drive 65+ or it was the slightest bit windy outside), shifter boot, navigation head unit, head rest, severe \u201cClunk\u201d sound\/feel when stopping, and a faulty low 4 wheel drive.  All separate issues that I have had to address on the brand new Toyota I purchased a little over 1 year ago. \nAmong all of the issues, the most severe issue this truck still has is a \u201cclunk\u201d sound and feel that occurs after coming to a stop.  It literally feels like someone hit me from behind.  Toyota mechanics have recognized this is not normal and have taken the steps to fix the issue including the replacement of the entire drive shaft, trouble shooting the electrical connectors at the transfer case, and NOW after a year Toyota's rep is claiming this \u201cClunk\u201d is a normal characteristic.  At two different dealers, I have had their two lead technicians (one being a mechanic for 26 years with Toyota) recognize this as a defect, and have taken steps to eliminate the \u201cClunk\u201d.  At the latter of the two dealers, the service manager, that Scott Riel(Toyota\u2019s rep) set me up with, sat in my car to experience the clunk, and looked at me in horror, vehemently tell me this clunk is not normal. He then had his lead technician (Warren) get in the truck to experience the \u201cClunk\u201d only to look at me in shock and say \u201cYou\u2019ve been dealing with this for 14 months on a brand new truck?! I am so sorry!\u201d  Warren spent the next 30 minutes experiencing the clunk while I would put the truck into 1st gear, drive six inches, stop, and continue to say he never has heard such a sound on a Tacoma.  Fast forward a few weeks later when Toyota's rep inspected the vehicle.  Contrary to what 2 separate dealers thought, the Toyota rep is now taking the stance \"all Tacomas in this model experience the same clunk\" as I do when stopping.  When sharing with two other Tacoma owners(who have the same model as I do), Toyota\u2019s ruling that the clunk is \u201cfuel slosh\u201d, they are as appalled as I am as neither of their vehicles exhibit this \u201cnormal characteristic\u201d supposedly all Tacomas have.  And if this characteristic was in fact normal, why would a Toyota technician of 26 years, not recognize this before replacing the entire drive shaft to try and fix the issue?  Furthermore, why wouldn\u2019t the service manager or lead technician, in a totally separate dealer, recognize this as normal when they work on Tacomas daily?  They both recognized this as ABNORMAL before trying to diagnose and fix the issue.  Today I made an attempt to contact Toyota one last time to see if they would agree to replace the fuel tank with one that doesn't allow fuel to build in momentum when I come to a stop, causing enough force to result in my truck jerking forward like someone hit me from behind.  They declined, indicating that because the Field Technician deems this a normal characteristic, they would not be willing to address this issue any longer.  I strongly caution you before you decide to buy a Toyota.  I never thought in my wildest dreams that Toyota, of all companies, would try scamming people into buying a model with known issues, and then take the stance these are \"normal\".  \n\nSo here I am with a truck that continues to clunk anytime the fuel is half filled or more.","6":"I have owned several Toyotas over the years.  I'm impressed with this one.  Mine is 2wd  SR5.  First of all if you get 4 cyl, remember it's a 4 cyl, not a V-6!  I'm getting 28mpg hwy with 15\" go-cart wheels.  The 4 cyl is quite impressive though.  The only complaints I have would be the cheap looking steel wheels, and the sound system.  To Toyota's defense, I must admit I went for economy price.  In that respect,  if I wanted larger wheels and sound, I could have bought the pre runner.  Very satisfied at nearly 2 year point!  Would buy one again.","7":"This is my first Tacoma And I am very satisfied so far. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the only time I can use the foglights is with the headlights on. It would be nice to put on the foglights by themselves. or along with the daytime running lights. This is the only thing that I don't like about the truck.","8":"I drove my 2015 4x4 Tacoma truck through deep water, the Ford in front was fine, the 2003 Tacoma behind me was fine. Water literally rushed into my truck through all four door seals. \nThis is my forth Tacoma, I will not own another, no way is this an off road truck.","9":"I have had Toyota trucks since 1993 and for what you pay, power lumbra should be standard.  All the competitors are.  So with a Toyota you give up some comfort for value and reliability and resale value.  There is no disputing the last three qualities but I wish Toyota would consider power lumbra for the driver at least.  For $3000 less you can buy a Rav 4 limited with navigation, heated leather seats and power lumbra.  Why not the Tacoma.  Although I really like my Coma and know it has the best resale value of any vehicle on the market, my next lease will probably be the Rav 4.  A truck for me is nice but not a necessity. The Rav 4 economic utility works as well for me.","10":"Engine lugs and shudders at 35-45 mph, Toyota will do nothing for you.  They state truck performs as designed.","11":"Read all the reviews you want .... but if you are going outdoors .... you must be nimble .... reliable ..... maneuverable...and unstoppable .. the Tacoma is the only vehicle that can fit this description. \n\nYes, you can find more comfortable rides .. with more bells and whistles .. but if you are going camping, biking, hiking, or fishing, the vehicle you take should not even be a preparatory consideration ...... and the Tacoma fits this \nrequirement .... it was made for outdoors and dependability .... I would never buy anything else.\n\nUpdate. It is so practical for my uses.  I needed a 4x4 for kayak, biking, fishing.  Works prefect. And looks awesome \ud83d\udc4c. I like this truck even more after looking at the 2016s. I just can't get used to the new design. Too much gingerbread.","12":"The nicest auto I have ever owned.","13":"I've been driving both ford and chevy trucks and both have been ok except  for gas mileage.So I decided to look at a new toyota tacoma and went for a test drive.The vehicle handed well with plenty of acceleration,has 4liter v6.And plenty options.So I purchased the vehicle the price was equal  to both ford and chevy.So not long after the purchase we put the little truck on the highway,for 2500 hundred miles pulling an 18 foot travel trailer.This was an excellent trip,the vehicle was great ,no problems,flat land,hills ,mountains just great. The fuel economy was good I didn't expect it to be,but it was good. I'm very pleased.","14":"Ok, I'm comparing this to my 2010 Ford Focus. It may not make sense, but in this case I'm just comparing technology, because a newer vehicle should have newer\/better technology right? My Focus had automatic locking doors over 15MPH, a display of MPG, how many miles till empty, which door was left ajar, and which tire was under deflated, an almost fully lit door controls panel to include lock\/unlock and all four windows, outside temperature, and a compass. I'll tell you what my 2015 Tacoma has out of all of those items. None of them. As soon as my eyes turn away from the center touch screen (only really needed for the backup camera) all I see is a cheap design. Awesome, great, there's a light that tells me my headlights are on. Why do I need that when the headlights shut off automatically anyway? If you don't have an HD radio your screwed from outside temperature. If you need to make a quick change on your route and need an idea of what direction you're going, you can't know that either. Finally, the truck bed doesn't lock. Are you joking? I'd rather know what's going on with my vehicle than have a TV attached, and, you know, be able to keep things safe in the bed... As you can see from the bubble fill in review, this is my only complaint. And a side note, SYNC by Microsoft is a better voice recognition\/command program.","15":"I shopped around before buying the Toyota Tacoma.   But, everything in my research pointed to this being the best choice for me.","16":"Great truck and fun to drive on and even better off roading. The dependability of this truck is the best in its class. This truck is great due to its simplicity of design. They sale more and last longer for a reason. If you want a truck with more interior gadgets then look at ford or chevy. If you want a serious offroad truck that is above the rest in dependability buy a tacoma. You will be glad you did in the short and diffenatially in the long term. This truck is funtional for off roading and on. This truck will easily go 250000 plus mile with normal care. Ask yourself how tacomas you see that have been on the road used and heavily still going with normal maintenace.","17":"I purchased this vehicle about a month ago and really enjoy it. The 4.0L v6 isnt going to win any races but gets you moving at a good pace and will last forever. The four wheel drive system works very well and has helped me conquer quite a few steep hills, wet grass, and light mud. As for fuel economy my first tank was 16.8 miles to the gallon with 50\/50 non aggressive driving but every tank since has been between 18-19 with 60 percent highway but also with me taking it off road and doing quick starts which is pretty remarkable. It is comfortable and drives like a truck. I don't feel that the seat is too low nor are the breaks sponge like as some have claimed.","18":"Compared to the 2012 Ford Focus SEL, decked out in leather etc, I traded in, I find this truck (2015 TRD Sport, double cab) much more comfortable and has a much less \"plasticy\" interior that the so-called upscale Focus. Everything appears extremely solid, down to the turn signal stick. Plus, coming from a small car, I don't get Edmunds \"weakness\" of low-mounted seats - these seat are mounted higher\/less reclined than Focus, or our 2012 Honda CRV. The engine can get a little noisy when pushed, but no worse than any other car I've driven. More room for carseats in the backseat too than the Focus. Overall wind and tire noise are surprisingly subdued. A very nice ride!","19":"The ETune system might sound better if they didn't remove the rear Access door speakers. I have owned five [5] other Tacomas and this is by far the worst sounding radio I have had in any of them. \n They took out the rear [Access] door speakers and replaced them with two tweeters in the headliner over your head. There is very little bass when you fade to the rear you need to turn up the volume all the way to even here them. I showed this to the dealer and they are helping me with Toyota to see if they will exchange the inside door panels from an older model, which will fit, that have the perforations for the speaker sound to enter the cab.\n I will take care of putting in the speakers. \n\n After talking to Toyota and them telling me that I shouldn't have purchased it,  I am very happy with my 2016 Ford F150 Lariet. NO more Toyota for me. Thay don't care about the customer.","20":"2015 TRD Sport -\r\nThis is my first ever brand new vehicle. I looked at several vehicles and this truck was the best bang for the buck. It was the most expensive out of all the trucks I looked at, but I felt that this will last me as Toyotas have always been dependable and the resale is great.","21":"I purchased my Tacoma new in spring of 2014, it was my first new car purchase. I purchased it new due to Toyota resale value is ridiculously expensive. It has been a great truck, never have had to fix anything. My only complain would be the stock Dunlop tires suck and cheap shocks they put on base models, but I replaced my tires to bfg mts, and my shocks to bilstein 5100 and it made it twice as good. Gas mileage isn't bad I average 21 and power is not to bad considering a 4 cylinder. For a 4 cylinder it tows very well, truck weighs 3700 lbs and I towed 3200 lbs over 500 miles through mountains and never lost 55 mph and flats I could do 75 mph no problem. Overall great truck, very solid built and 2.7 motor not to bad just on really long climbs.","22":"TRD Sport package...perfect.  I don't do crazy \"off roading.\"  But I do go off pavement in the mountains and\/or hunting lease.  I don't pull trailers or haul heavy loads, but I do occasionally carry bulky stuff like firewood (1\/2 cord) furniture, or yard stuff (fertilizer, mulch, etc).  I LOVE this truck...it's perfect.  4WD is perfect in \"bad\" weather like mud\/snow\/ice.  Never been stuck or even thought about it.   A little tight with two adults in front and two car seats in back, but very manageable.  Engine has adequate umph, but I wish it had more (of course).  Stock tires were underwhelming so I changed to BFG KO2's...which hurt the MPG a little.  I get 17 MPG (mostly city).   The build is solid.  Doesn't feel \"plasticy\" like Chevy Colorado.  Reliability is great...I'm easy on the miles, but I've never had to put a wrench to it, only scheduled maintenance. \n\n*** UPDATE - Still perfect truck.  28K miles - runs better now than when I bought it.  Love the Blue Tooth\/iPhone and iTunes compatibility.  Wish list: 1) quieter - but I added off-road tires.  2) really don't care for the \"weather app.\" I really prefer an on-board thermometer. 3) moon roof.  4) better MPG...I don't put many miles and I cost myself some mileage with the off-road tires.  But I still wish it got more.  5) TRD super-charger - Toyota discontinued these.  I know there are other aftermarket S\/C's.  But I want Toyota.  I think that aftermarket kills the warranty?  6) push button start.  7) auto rear sliding window  8) leather heated seats. \n\nBottom Line - I love it and would totally buy it again.  \n\nSECOND UPDATE - Still love my '14 Tacoma, but traded at 35K miles (lease was up) for a '17 Tacoma Pro.  I cannot say enough good things about my '14 Tacoma.  It was the perfect truck.","23":"Purchased my new 2014 Toyota Tacome V6 w\/ Tow Pckg in April of this year.  Been on a few trips this year.  Getting a new vehicle was huge for me, of my own, as was getting a truck!  I love love love having my own truck.  And I have loved Toyotas in the past.  So my heartbreak is quite profound regarding my experience. \r\n\r\nInterior comfort is horrible.  The design of the seats is such that it makes a person hunch forward, and this cannot be alleviated with raising or lowering the headrest, or by adjusting the lumbar knob which really doesn't do much besides adjust the firmness of the seat behind your lower back.  After 2.5 hours on the road, my back was screaming in pain.  After 7, in tears. ","24":"ive had the truck for a month and a half now and just had my first oil change and so far I love it the ride is amazing soft but it is not bad when I had to go on some bumpy roads quiet on the freeway and im impressed with the engine the 2.7 has the power to merge even with cargo but great on gas too if you don't need the V6 go for the 4cyl its a great little engine nice sound system too I was impressed\n","25":"I have owned 3 of the the Tacoma product as well as an FJ and a Land Cruiser. I looked at all the choices out there when it came to spending approx $40,000 on a new vehicle. I ended up wiht a 2014 Tacoma TX Baja Access Cab in white. $37,605++\nThis truck is a whole lot of bang for the buck. The ergonomics are very well thought out from a drivers perspective. The seating is very non fatiguing on trips. The footprint is really what attracted me to this again as its a truck you can hop in and park anywhere, even a Trader Joes parking lot. You can also find and access a whole lot of trails a full size truck can not. the weight is such that you wil not get bogged down off road. \nTX Baja = Smiles","26":"Looked at 4 different trucks. This one stands out as the best built, greatest value.","27":"Might as well get all the bells and whistles on this unique, tricked out version of the Tacoma. Almost 4 years later and still turning heads everywhere we go.","28":"This vehicle I've owned for 2 years.  It has automatic accelerated twice.  Toyota refuses to deal with the issue, blaming the weather tech floor liners.  Which come no where near the gas pedal.  The truck should not continue to accelerate while you have both feet on the brake mashing it to the floor.","29":"the v6 is the noise king of all vehicles. engine thrashes like a 100 year old combine. real low quality front brakes. this truck is junk. had a 93 model & was 3 times a better truck. all the 4.0 engines are like this. Probably worst vehicle I ever bought.","30":"I purchased this truck in 2013 brand new.  I still own it in October of 2016.  There are two design flaws and one other issue with this truck.  The two design flaws are: 1. There are two rubber strips across the top of the truck that come loose in strong wind or at the car was.  I'm not exactly sure why these two rubber strips are on top of the truck in the first place.  They don't seem to do anything except come off the truck.  2.  The painted on descriptions of the controls.  For example ... POWER on the radio knob.  These painted on descriptions come off over time since they weren't recessed into the dash then painted so you couldn't touch the paint.  In my opinion if they were just recessed without painting they would look better.  So the descriptions of the knobs will come off over time due to touching them.  The other issue is towing and the shifting of gears.  I towed a UTV on a utility trailer.  I could not use the cruise control when towing this UTV because the RPM's would go too high.  Even without towing something the shifting takes a while at higher speeds (60+ MPH) when getting on the highway.  Once it does finally shifts gears lowering the RPM's it's fine.  I love the way my Tacoma TRD looks and handles, but there are issues that keep it from getting a 5 star rating that could have been caught in the design of this vehicle.  I would recommend this truck but not if you want to tow something at it's maximum towing capacity and as long as you are OK with it's design faults.","31":null,"32":"Looking for a respectable truck that can get around town and hit trail. Some of the amenities are a little outdated and the mileage is less than you want. That said, you want a capable off road vehicle that is comfortable around town with ok mileage then this is it.","33":"I purchased my 2013 Toyota Tacoma TRD 4wd new and only have two complaints. First the brakes are grabby sometimes at start up during cold weather. I plan on upgrading the brakes with quality drilled and slotted rotors with premium brake pads soon. Second when in 4wd low there is an alarm that goes off the entire time you have 4wd low selected. Very annoying! The truck is very off road capable and in my opinion the off road version rates up there with the  Jeep Rubicon! I really love this truck and get a lot of compliments on it. My wife has a 2016 Limited 4runner and the brakes are perfect on it so Toyota has improved them. We have owned several makes and models and have had the best service with Toyota brands!  The last four Toyota vehicles we have owned and sold over the years we made money on or got what we paid for them minus basic maintenance costs. We take very good care of our vehicles and have not had any trouble selling our previous used Toyota's!  We live in a mountainous area and all the bear hunters use Toyota Tacoma 4wd trucks due to their bullet proof reliability and go any where abilities even with 300k miles on them!  Take care of them and they will last!  If I could have only one truck it would be a Toyota with out a doubt! We work hard for our money and want a trouble free vehicle that is still worth something in ten years. Toyota has proven to us to be reliable trouble free vehicles especially the Tacoma's and 4Runners!","34":"Great value for the cost, I looked for a truck for months. Most cost to much for a truck; if I wanted all the luxury bells and whistles I would buy a car. This truck fits me for the type of small projects I  like doing.","35":"Won't ever drive anything else but a Toyota Tacoma or 4 runner again!","36":"I owned a Nissan Frontier and the tires were bigger and the seats were better and you did not hear a lot of noise from the engine and  like the Tacoma the engine has some power on the v-6  model but the Frontier v-6 is more powerful can handle bad weather better but the Tacoma has a better blind spot area than  the Frontier both trucks are way over priced the Tacoma is mostly hype from its rich past the truck is made to fast and is poorly engineered Toyota is becoming like GM to big and it hurts when you fall from the top what can make the truck better is  bigger tires and correct the  engine noise problem and  a better  braking system this may be my last Tacoma","37":null,"38":"This is the best vehicle I have owned. I drive a lot of miles each year plus tow a 3000lb camper very frequently. This truck has not let me down at all. I love the comfort and style. The navigation works flawlessly and the JBL stereo is very nice. I have driven this truck through all types of climate and coast to coast and not experienced a single problem. This truck brings me joy just to get in and drive it. I simply love my Tacoma. Update...after driving it for 3 years now it has not gone smoothly. I have had consistent issues with the air conditioner not working properly and at 60000 the rear differential went out on the truck, this was a known issue with Toyota and there was a TSB for the problem. That being said makes my opinion of Toyotas reliability not as good.","39":"Had a '14 4cyl. Tacoma access cab that I hit\/bounced off a bridge 2 X at 70 MPH all bags (except passenger - no passenger) went off. It was totaled but crumpled as designed and trans\/engine went into pavement as designed. It saved my life and no injuries. Replaced it with this '13 pre runner with a 4.0 six cyl. Get real avg. 20 MPG. Installed a Firestone rear airbag kit and the ride improved dramatically carrying 10 psi. with no load. I am an old guy and do not race around but plenty of power for me. We have had a 4runner, Landcruiser and several older off road junk tacomas. They all did their job and lasted if maintained.","40":"I have owned this truck for almost 2 years now and think it is a piece of junk, it is very gutless and gets very poor mileage. I bought it to get better mileage than my 1999 gmc with a v-8 however it gets less mileage than the other truck which has ten times the power and gets 20 to 22 miles per gallon. this heap only gets 18 mpg on the highway and won't climb a hill more than 40 miles per hour, as well as it shifts into overdrive going up a hill and is loosing speed....wish I had my GMC back and toyota had this junk shoved down their throat","41":"bought it certified pre owned; with 13k miles, and 100k warranty, saved 30%. mine is not a 4x4; but, I'm not an off roader. No, it isn't a Tundra deluxe, but I like it. very comfortable ride; better than an SUV, great truck for those who want the best of both worlds. I don't do much hauling; if you want heavy duty, look for a Tundra, but for every day family use and utility; this is great. ","42":"I traded in my BMW for this truck and what a difference. I know I can't compare apples to oranges but basic things that were lacking in a 2013 model really irritated me. For instance I drove from California to the NW and on the way encountered cold weather, the side mirrors would fog up and there weren't any defrosters to clear this up. Also, the gas mileage was awful. This truck doesn't have a very strong engine. The standard sound system was ok but could be improved. The gearing on the manual transmission was very hard to shift. i guess it would be good as a hauling vehicle for short trips but other than that definitely not a daily commuter.","43":"After owning a troubled GM truck for a decade, I had high hopes for this truck. Unfortunately it seems that Toyota has dropped the ball.\nThough a smaller engine than the 6 cylinder S-10 I owned, this 4 cylinder gets worse gas mileage. The ride is very choppy and the Dunlop installed tires seem very cheap.\nWhy not Michelin Toyota? The exterior of the truck is stylish and the seats on the prerunner are very comfortable, but what is the deal with that cheap Entunes crap stereo?\nThe sound is awful and the so called voice activation rarely works.\nI do like the space in the access cab and the warranty offered was excellent, but Toyota could do better.","44":"I find it hard to believe how many people have blind loyalty to these trucks. There are countless issues with them if you just look them up on forums and blogs. I have most of the problems people complain about: Drive line vibrations, brake shutter, wheel shutter, loud dashboard creaks and rattles. The whole truck shakes like crazy when I try to accelerate hard from a dead stop. The engine is chirping like there's a belt problem. The valves clatter when the water temp is cold. I practically have to wait for the water temp to get to normal running level before it stops. I love the truck and I want to keep it forever, but I get the feeling it either won't hold up or I'll grow to resent it.\n***Update:  It has been 4.5 years, 87,500 miles and not much has changed.  The belt noise wasn't the belt at all.  No one could figure it out.  Dealer charged me for belt replacement and when that didn't fix it, they tried to tell me it was the A\/C compressor.   Not until I took the truck in for a recall to replace the catalytic converter did the noise go away.  Valves still clatter and click when cold.  Driveline vibration is just as bad if not worse and now I hear what I think are the u-joints chirping.  There's also a gear whine coming from powertrain.  Sound like the differential.  There's now mildew in the window guides on every door.  After a rain, it's putrid.   The windshield wipers started to howl like crazy.  They start relatively quiet, but when you drive a while in the rain they get louder and louder.   Been on my third set of different tires.  Different brand, different style and no tire store can balance the wheels.  I've isolated it to one wheel, but no one can figure it out because it shows balance.  Took the wheel off the truck and had it looked at for a possible bend or some sort of irregularity, but there's nothing wrong with it.  I remember having this problem within the first month of ownership.  Dealer kept the truck for weeks to figure it out.  One day they told me it was their machine.  Had to send it next door to Lexus for balance.  Problem was gone.  Next set of tires, same problem.  Live with it until the next set where I purchase very, very expensive, high quality Michelin's.  Same problem now a different wheel.  Took the truck to a vibration specialist.  They load balanced all the wheels at 80mph and the problem went away.  Ask the tech why this is so critical and why so expensive.  He says some vehicles are prone to it.  It's a characteristic of the car\/truck.  It's expensive because there are only two places in town to get it done:  His place and Lexus.  Wow! it all makes sense now.  Point is: Toyota is well aware these trucks have issues, so why do anything about it?  They still have little competition.  Plus, they are riding on the coat tails of loyal customers, good word of mouth and long term reliability.  Well, all I can say is nothing else has broke on the truck so far, but I've own lots of cars past 150-200K miles and honestly, once you get past 100K, they tend to all hold up comparably.  I've had Honda, Kia, Chevy, Ford, Mitusbishi and VW.  The two cars I've had the fewest problems with and kept the longest?  Kia, Mitsubishi and Honda in order of most mileage.  Toyota in my opinion is nothing special.","45":"Bought a TRD Off-Road version and have already put 25K miles on it.\nThe truck is very comfortable to drive, relatively quiet inside, and it is just the right size for my needs.\nThe JBL sound system is comparable to the upgraded sound systems on most luxury cars.\nThe V6 provides more than adequate power, but I'd love to see the Tundras 4.6 V8 as an option.\nThe BFG tires that come with the off-road strike a great balance between on road and off road driving.\n\nAlso despite the Edmunds review the brakes are not at all spongy, if anything they are grabby.","46":"I love my truck and wouldn't trade my truck for anything, but I have been spending lots of money for a little more horsepower and gas mileage. I am leaning more towards a turbo which are hard to come by because its too new. I'm not sure other Toyota models have more horsepower than the Tacoma. Other models include the Camry, 4-Runner, and FJ Cruiser. ","47":"There are only a couple of choices for a mid-size pickup. The Tacoma is an average vehicle that could easily be much better.\nAll Tacoma's speedometers are off by 3 mph and all 4-cyl engines tick like toy engines.\nThe 4-cyl engines are less than adequate for a useful pickup truck.\nThe transmission has to downshift twice going up marginal grades at 65 mph. I want more mpg than the standard 1\/2 Ton PU, but need enough power for adequate highway driving.","48":"I had been driving a 1994 Toyota pickup for 17 years and decided to trade for a new one.\nI was sure it would be another Toyota, and spent quite a bit of time deciding which model to get.\nI'm hopeful that my research might help others in deciding what to buy.\n\nI mostly drive the truck back and forth to work, so it was important to get a comfortable vehicle that is fun to drive.\nThe SR5 package has more comfortable seats in my opinion and a nicer interior, so I got the SR5 package.\nThe 4-cylinder has plenty of power for me.\nThe truck is quiet and comfortable and I enjoy driving it.\n\n\nI've owned the truck for 4.5 years now and it has 35k miles on it.  It has been flawless as far as reliability.  There was one recall for something in the exhaust system, but otherwise all I've done is change the oil and filters.  \n\nI've used the truck to haul brush and yard waste, furniture, recycled and small loads of lumber.  For hauling, a shorter truck like this is easier to load and unload than a tall truck.  Other guys, with full sized trucks can't reach over the side of the bed to load and unload and have to crawl up into the bed of the truck.  I'm 5'10\" and can load and unload mine a lot easier.  For hauling, I think this is a better choice than getting the 4WD chassis, which is about 4 inches taller, or a full sized truck.  Starting in 2016 this shorter chassis is no longer available.  The shorter chassis doesn't look as good as the 4WD chassis, especially with the smaller steel wheels and tires.  But from a practical viewpoint it is a better truck.\n\nThe 2.7 4-cylinder is a little underpowered.  It is ok, but around town and on the highway I wish it had a little more power.  It handles good for a truck and is reasonably quiet on the highway as far as wind noise.  \n\nThe front seats are fairly comfortable.  The rear jump seats are crowded and uncomfortable - for short trips only, but a lot better than not having a rear seat when you need it.  I keep ropes and bungees in the floor of the rear for tying stuff down.  The rearview camera is in the rearview mirror.  The radio\/cell phone interface was easy to learn to use.","49":"I have owned jeeps, wranglers and cherokees. This Tacoma with the TRD off road package, supercharger, and Baja suspension is a much better vehicle then the jeeps. Much more reliable and excellent off road. Will it mach a Rubicon no, but it will hang with it. The truck is much more reliable and comfortable on the road then a rubicon. Toyota's dependability is unmatched.\n","50":"I recently replaced my 1997 T100 SR5 with the access cab Tacoma. I had well over 200,000 on the T100. I figured the Tacoma would serve me well also. I ordered the 4cyl Base Access Cab with the SR5 Package. The milage for the first month has been 24.6 - 25 MPG. The fit and finish is excellent, Millage is where it is advertised, and performance with the 4 cyl. has exceeded my expectations. I like the rear view camera, makes hooking up my small trailer a snap! I have a single axle trailer that I use to pull my Arctic Cat Prowler around with. The trailer loaded weighs about 1700 lbs., I have not\nhad any problems to date. I'd purchase the same truck again!","51":"My 2013 Takoma, purchased new 3 months ago, has 6250 miles on it.\nThe dealer (Ourisman Chantilly Toyota) tells me that the clutch is completely worn down.\nI have driven manuals for years and am certainly not hard on the clutch, nor do I \"ride\" the clutch.\nIt is hard to rebut the conclusion that this is somehow my fault and the clutch is excluded from every warranty, even the fancy \"Auto4Life\" service contract and the \"Carefree Car Protection Service Contract\".\nThe repair will cost more than $2,000.\nI submit that this is a mechanical problem reflective of the truck.","52":"No Tacoma \"Fan Boy\" here. This is my first Toyota vehicle and there have been no surprises so far. The 2013 Tacoma has been what a truck this size should be. Powerful, quite, smooth at highway speeds. It does have a firm ride thanks to the TRD off road pkg. I am 6'1\" and the cab had plenty of room in the front and rear seats. Parking this truck is no major chore with the short bed. I paid $500 below invoice or $30180 before TTL fees. Overall I am very happy with this truck.","53":"I love this truck!! Legendary reliability and resale value is ridiculously high! I have a v6 tx edition pre runner double cab so it has a tough rugged look. Cant even count how many compliments Ive gotten on how badass the truck looks, I had a crewmax tundra and the taco is much easier to maneuver and more comfortable to drive daily, although the interior is smaller, my 2 kids and the wife fit comfortably. My only regret is not getting the 4x4 but I'm not much of an offroader. I mainly use the vehicle to drive to work , plenty of stop n go lights but gas mileage is decent and you don't notice the meter move unlike full size trucks.","54":"I've been driving BMWs for quite a awhile but my wife and I entered the home renovation phase that required multiple trips to Lowes\/HomeDepot and similar stores. The day I had to pay a guy with a truck $20 to assist me with delivering some drywall was the day I knew we needed a truck in our household.\n\n\nNot a BMW but for a mid-size truck, comfortable and agile enough to move around town without mowing everyone down.\nI purchased a special 'demo' version that contains almost every accessory available and it's a sharp looking vehicle. My wife, kids and even the dogs seem to enjoy it. I feel good that I don't have to worry tearing up $60K plus vehicles while renovating our home.\n","55":"I bought the TRD access cab. My wife and I like to bike and canoe. This truck fits our lifestyle perfectly. I had a 4 door tundra (too big and looked and operated clumsy). The Tacoma however, looks incredible and feels and handles very smooth. I park it in the garage and just look at it.\nI would highly recommend.","56":"most uncomfortable truck i've ever owned. The \ndriver's seat is so poorly designed I can hardly walk when I leave the truck after 30 minutes of driving. Miss my chevy silverado crew cab. \nThe dealership was terrible, didn't even offer to\ndemonstrate the vehicle after the purchase. Just\nhanded me the keys and walked away. \n(Smithtown Toyota, NY). I had to go find the truck myself.\n\nThe truck is overpriced to begin with which explains the higher resale price. After driving \nfull sized silverados with every option available\nfor almost the same price, I was amazed that so\nfew comfort and convenience options are available for these trucks i.e. power leather \nheated seats, climate control.","57":"I have only owned Rangers and F150s my whole life.\nIts 2012 and Ford no longer makes the Ranger nor did they ever offer a 4 cyl double cab.\nI turned to Toyota due to claims of reliability and the size of the Tacoma.\nIts the perfect size. Bought the Double cab prerunner with the 4 cyl motor and LOVE it.\nPlenty of power to get around.\nMPG is right on EPA estimates which I cant say about my F150.\nSo far have averaged 21.4MPG with heavy city driving.\nThe build quality is great as are numerous features of the truck.\nIt looks tough and sits high which I like for visibility.","58":"Reliable, value driven utility vehicle with multiple purposes. Comfortable but not luxurious or techy","59":"I own a 2010- 4wd,  5 speed regular cab and it is peppy nice looking and good handling truck, it really does climb steep inclines v. Well, I was surprised. The regular cab is discontinued\u2639\ufe0f But I will keep this truck forever, never been stuck def. destined to be collectors.","60":"I read a couple of these reviews and it makes me think these people don't actually own one. Must be out of their price range. I have a 2012 double cab here in the Pacific Northwest and these trucks are everywhere and for a good reason!!! The snow, rain, and ice storms we get it handles it with ease and very safe and feel in control. I feel the 2012 was the big change in the trucks, the older models had a recall on frame. This truck is better built very comfortable to drive and love the hood scoop very fun to drive! I also own a Lotus Evora with a toyota motor they are very dependable! The 4.0 engines are famous for their dependability and 20+ miles per gallon for a truck that seats 5 is amazing!! Say that about your ford's, Chevy, or dodge...you can't! This truck will be for our family for many many years to come and the only money I'll be spending will be on after market parts! You will not be disappointed with this truck, very fun to drive!!!","61":"I just purchased this beauty (been searching for a Tacoma for 3 1\/2 weeks) and have read up alot on reviews, Pros\/Cons.  This truck was built for it's year '12, of course fuel economy wasn't great back in the year but fuel at that time was cheap as well.  This style reminds  me of my time, when I was younger, so it brings back alot of memories.  It's not the High tech\/push the button on warm seats\/easy smooth turns, etc etc plz people it's a truck that will do the job when needed.  To save gas on long distance hwy (put the gear in 4-D drive, it will save you gas (around 22-24 mph).  In the city well that's different (can put you at 16-18, all depends on how you drive, right).  As for metal to the pedal, me personally it picked up quick and felt the power\/jerk on this baby.  Long bed vs Short bed: long bed you get a better smoother ride when accelerating compare to the short bed. Long Bed you have a better balance and you can put more items in the back.  I'm an old school kind of guy and this truck fits the year it was built.. people these days want old school trucks to be like luxury and well, they should either sell it and get a more of there style truck.  I had the option to get a '17 or '16, but body style was different, remember (for those who knows) '12 was the beginning of a new body style change for Tacoma and it was also a change of technology as well.  So... it comes down to this: great truck, it has the power (long bed) I have the TDR sport and so far at 80k now.. i havent had any issues...","62":"Excellent lite duty truck.","63":"This is a fantastic truck. I plan to keep it for another 100,000 miles at least. I have used the four wheel drive in heavy snow in upstate NY and on Florida Beaches and it performs flawlessly. I would have no hesitation in hopping in and driving to the Florida Keys or Alaska. The two options I wish that it had would be heated mirrors and a remote starter. I replaced the tires at just over 50,000 miles. This has been my 13th truck and the best. If you are looking for a mid size truck, give the Tacoma a test drive. I recently had the truck serviced, had new brakes installed, all fluids changed and new spark plugs. My only complaint is the gas mileage has gone down. If your A\/C doesn't seem to be as good as it could be, check the internal air filter. Mine was dirty, plus a few things fell out of the back of the glove compartment partially blocking the air flow.","64":"My 2012 reg cab\n4x4 gets very poor fuel milage .

","65":"Truck has unpredictable hesitation \/ stall.  This is not a good thing with oncoming traffic & is Extremely Unsafe.  Toyota has been notified, but their response is to drive more aggressively (Unsafe).  When you pull out into traffic & their is no response to the gas pedal, it is a very unsafe feeling.\n    I've had Tacomas in the past with marginal gas mileage of 25 mpg, but this is terrible - less than 20 mpg.\nToyota has gotten worse & does not live up to the high standards that it once had.\nVery tinny when closing doors & Poor Dealer Maintenance.\nProbably will not buy again unless they improve much more.\nThey are relying on past reputation instead of making a better vehicle.\n\nFinally found a good Tacoma - 2007 Base model: Good gas mileage, reliable, better than the newer ones.  Toyota lost a new car sale, but don't produce the vehicles customers want.  Too bad, so sad.  Guess they don't listen to customers.\nSeems like there is No Engineering; only Sales & Marketing today.\nPut some Engineering effort into this:\nImprove Gas Mileage -30 mpg+ can be done & quit all the electronic giz wiz \"features\".\nGet back to basics & make a good, fuel efficient vehicle again.","66":"I've had this about 10 months now and get more aggravated with it each time I drive it.\nFirst, you get neither power or fuel economy.\nTraded an FJ for this which had gobs of power to this that seems woefully underpowered and it gets 15-17 mpg while driving it like miss Daisy is my passenger. Mine is the TRD crew cab, and it has no heated mirrors, many of the interior switches are not back-lit so driving at night or in cold weather the truck is a pain in the neck.\nThe most recent insult was the ENTUNE update they sent on a USB drive.\nNow none of the functions are working even though my phone shows a good bluetooth connection.","67":"I only wish it got 35mpg... maybe they will put a turbo diesel in it eventually.\nbut for what it is, this is the best truck out there.\nTows my boat, hauls 2 motorcycles, and carries 4 passengers comfortably at the same time... What more could one ask for? except 35mpg (it gets 24...when not towing).\nif you want a practical truck this is it. best in quality and value. I love my toy taco... any time i pass a job site, everyone turns and says \"that's a nice truck\".\n\n\n\n","68":"I purchased my '12 Tacoma in December of '11 with the Sports upgrade package and ETune system.\nWith 24k miles to date, I haven't had even the slightest of issues and I've put it through quite a bit.\nBlue Tooth hooks up to my iPhone in seconds.\nThe stereo and sub are awesome.\n4x4 cuts through mud and snow without hesitation.\nGas mileage is average if you don't have a lead foot.\nStill enjoy driving it.\nHandles exceptionally well for a pick-up and acceleration is surprising.\nEverything feels tight and well placed for easy adjustments and\/or after market additions.\nThe bed liner is great and storage will surprise you.\nI've had GM's all my life and I won't go back.","69":"I purchased a Blue 2012 Tacoma Sport 4x4 with the Sport upgrade package that gives you Bilstein shocks, and 18in chrome wheels. After 4k miles I added the supercharger and TRD exhaust.\nAs warned the supercharger does whine on acceleration but settles out on the highway.\nDead stop\n0-60 times are 6.4 but the real performance enhancement is the 60-80 MPH response. Prior to the supercharger and exhaust being installed I got at best 19.5 -21.1 MPG on the Highway and 14-16 combined. Now I get 21.5 to 22 highway and 18 combined. I strongly suggest getting both the supercharger and exhaust as they really up the performance and gas mileage. The truck rides nice and manuevers in town well. ","70":"I am a casual truck user, meaning I do haul trailers, dirt bikes, quads, mulch, and the occasional camper. It stands up to every task I ask of it, and it takes me to and from work daily as well. The camper shell on the back smoothes out the truck feel of the empty bed. It's just enough weight to make it go down the road very comfortably full or empty.","71":"I have a 2012 double cab v6 TRD Off-Road, 100% stock. Lemon??\n\nMy first Toyota. Bought new from dealer out of state, arrived by transporter and immediately had major drive line vibration. Been to local dealer 3x; in contact with Toyota USA because the dealers can't fix. \n\nRead up on this at TacomaWorld, there are many 2012's with this prob, sad.\n\nIf you must buy, test drive from a dead stop through 30mph, up hill if possible. Putting a load on it makes the prob especially noticeable if it's there at all. \n\nToyota modern day quality is sub-par, unfortunately they're the only mid-size truck with a v6, 4x4, double cab w\/ manual trans option. \n\nbtw, manual trans is made by Aisin = not goo","72":"I had a 2010 GMC Sierra 1500, but really wanted something smaller to drive around town.\nOverall a nice truck, but it has some significant cost cutting that shows through.\nWith an MSRP of almost $35k, it is hard to believe that the 4WD selector, outside mirror, fog light, and door switches are not back-lit.\nDrove the truck the second day I owned it at night in a snowstorm.\nHad to pull over to find the 4wd switch.\nJust plain cheap!\nWhat could it cost to back light the switches, $10?\nA hood prop rod?\nWhat, another $20 for struts?\nNo heated mirrors or rear defroster available at any price? I guess it never snows.\nAuto-door locks?\nEntune does not work wirelessly (BT) with an iPhone!","73":"I traded my 2003 Tacoma regular cab at 210000 miles with no problems and still running strong. I always like the styling of the 2005's and was glad that the restyling of the new 2012 was suttle. It has a nice smooth ride, handles very well and is more spacious than my previous truck. It has adequate power, easy to handle and a nice turning radius for easy parking. I checked out the Nissan Frontier, also a nice truck but the turning radius was very wide and not available in a regular cab. The new gauge cluster lighting on my new Tacoma is very cool. I never did care for the all orange lighting on the previous models but that's a matter of personal opinion. I plan on keeping it for many years.","74":"I bought (and reviewed on here) my 2009 Audi TT Convertible which has been and continues to be a blast. At 85K miles, I decided to let it be my weekend car and get a truck for the first time. I had always been in love with Tacomas. \nThis October I got a 2012 Pre-Runner Xtra Cab and couldn't be happier. The interior has been upgraded and has a stylish, sporty feel. There is plenty of storage and plenty of room without feeling like you are driving in the middle of a cavern. The 4 CYL engine definitely provides enough power, and the Pre-Runner look gives the appearance of a 4x4 without the drawbacks on MPG.","75":"Rides and drives good in city better on interstate","76":"I bought a 2012 colorado crew cab used w\/ 21,400 miles with the 5 cyl. 3.7L engine.  The 4 cyl. engine was too weak, and fuel efficiency difference was only 1 mpg.  Alone with luggage I get 24.5 mpg at 66 mph.  With more ppl and luggage its more like 22 mpg.  In houstons mix of highway and city I tend to get 19-20 mpg.  It now has 60,000 miles and have had a $400 sensor go out.  Ride and road noise are not the best, but livable.  Turning radius better than full size, but not great.  I find fuel mileage is significantly better than full size trucks, and I have had no issues with the drivetrain.  This truck has no frills, but its reliable.  This is the midsize truck to buy if you want value.","77":"Bought in 2004 new, at 163k miles! Loved it and it fuel sipping ways so much bought another 2004 single cab 5 spd, capable of whomping those heavy Hemis. 19 gallon tank that runs on 87 equals great value on a truck built for economy. My single cab has caltrack latter bars, intake, Spal electric fans, exhaust and corvette c6 seats. Having a hard time replacing them. The eaton locker on both is a traction dream. I am a car guy, that sells an average of 6 cars a year personally, I'm stuck on my Colorados!!!","78":"Have owned the Colorado V8 for around 18 months, and it has been a true joy to drive,\n300 HP in this relatively light vehicle is amazing, and it is a real sleeper.\nThe sports suspension and low profile tires make it corner flat in most all situations.\n This is a little like driving a vette in pickup clothing.\n\nOn the downside, the interior is pretty spartan, and the ride can get a little rough at times. Gas mileage pretty much sucks.\nAll in all, a fine vehicle that I would buy again.\n","79":"So far this has been a great truck.\nIt handles very well, rides decent for a 4X4 and its gas mileage is good for a 4x4.\nIt also looks better than its competition but that is a matter of personal preference.\nSome of the reviews dont really reflect this is a truck for its intended purpose and not a car.\nExcellent 4X4 capabilities.","80":"I bought this 2012 Chevy Colorado with the 3.7 liter 5 used with 21,000 miles. I then took it on a 6,000 mile road trip this September 2012 thru 22 states. From Charleston South Carolina, to Great Falls Montana to Parker Arizona back to Charleston. The Last leg of the trip from AZ to SC I towed a 2000 Dodge Dakota single cab with a frame hitch behind my Colorado. throughout the entire trip the truck ran excellent. Before towing the Dodge I averaged 24.5 MPG highway at about 75 MPH. Towing the Dodge I managed 15-19 MPG. driving up the continentual divides in both Arizona and New Mexico I was able to maintain a steady speed of 70 MPH while towing. The truck would run at about 2500 RPM.","81":"I have owned 2 Chevy Colorado Crew Cabs starting with an '05 LS Crew Cab and 2.8L engine and a 2010 Crew Cab with 3.7L engine. Both were 2WD. My family and I have found this configuration to be more useful and appealing than the purchase of a compact SUV. \n\nThe reason I write this is because besides the great service and reliability, the new 3.7L in 2WD actually gets as good or better than the 2.8L. We routinely drive 330 mi. each way to a family cabin. On three recent trips (May, June, July)\nwe got 26.3, 26.5, and 26.7 mpg on one leg. This was with AC on or off. It just confuses me how some say this truck get no better mpg than full size trucks. It gets 17-19 city and 24 to +26 highway.","82":"After owning a 1999 Chevy S10 Blazer for 13yrs this is a great truck to upgrade to. My parents gave me their 99 and I loved it but traded it in for a truck and my blazer had more kick to it but it hated it. I really like how simple the Colorado is, nothing fancy just the basic features and with Crew cab and Z71 package I got more than I ever wanted with it. Like my blazer i'm gonna keep it for a long time. If you are looking for a simple cheep reliable truck this would be a good one to look at. I haven't yet done much with it but I can drive from base to my parents house (200miles) in about half a tank which is great!","83":"I tend to buy vehicles at the end of their design life -- bugs have been worked out, etc, and deals are there.\nThis 2WD Colorado is an exceptional value for the money. It IS comfortable, looks great, and from other owners I talked to, is RELIABLE.\nIn 3,000 miles so far this is the case.\nDon't listen to professional reviews that push you towards imports...they ALL have cheap plastic interior.\nChevy did a great job on this truck. Perfect? No. Affordible, reliable, a great VALUE?\nYES YES YES.\nHave pulled pop up camper, hauled dirt and rock all in first months of use.\n Only wish 2WD models were easier to find on the lots...why do we need 4WD when roads are cleared soon after it snows?","84":"Really like it, have had Dakota's, Ranger's, full size Chevy's, this is the best yet.\nBetter gas mileage, simple controls, very comfortable and very nicely priced. Dated? Maybe but it has all the same bells-and-whistles the others have, at least in the LT2 I purchased. \n\nForget the reviews, if you want a truck but not full size this is the one and don't expect back seats in any extended cab to be \"real\" seats.","85":"I traded my 2014 Silverado for the 2015 Colorado based on the size. I had broken my ankle and it was a little more difficult to get into the Silverado because of its height so I buckled down and bought the Colorado with a Crew Cab. Beautiful looking truck that seemed to ride nice on the Test Drive. The next day I had this weird feeling that I shouldn't have traded, but I really didn't know why. My first trip to my dad's house which is an hour and a half from me on hills and winding turns, it handled really great but it wasn't shifting right. The dealer didn't know why at first but was willing to try to find out why. I was going to try to keep it awhile to get it paid down but then several recalls later and many visits to the dealership, it just cost me money. The dealership was 30 minutes away so even with the warranty's I still spent a lot in gas going back and forth from the dealership. The gas Mileage wasn't as good as it should have been compared to the Silverado. I got almost the same gas mileage. I was missing my Silverado more and more every day. I was leaving my job one day after a hard day's work and I threw the truck in Reverse to back out of my spot and then I went into drive and that's when the Gearshift just fell off, I mean completely off. I had no gears but that, so I had to go straight to the dealership, I couldn't back up or anything. They fixed it and gave me a car to drive, and then later I had to have my dash and cameras replaced. The shifting seem to get worse the longer I had it and then it started using oil. The oil was 2 quarts low at time of change. The straw that broke the camels back was the AC. It worked great but the line that goes from the AC Pump to the vents was corroded and ended up causing mold to form behind the dash which smelled so bad that I almost vomited the day I decided enough is enough. I have always been a Chevy fan and I still am but I have not had a good experience with this truck. I went out on June 30th and traded it in for a 2017 Silverado. I must say that I believe I'm going to be happy again. I didn't have that feeling the next day like I did with the Colorado. I didn't know why I had that feeling but I think there was something to it. Would I recommend this truck?...If you want a smaller truck that looks good and has a good stereo then yes I would, but if you want quite in the cab as well as smooth shifting and more comfort and reliability, then no I would not. The only thing about this truck I liked was the Color and the Bose Sound System. That is it.","86":"I love my truck. The only problem i have with it is the uncomfortable front seats where my thighs hit the seats. Built up too much. Puts a lump in the middle of the leg. Also the transmission is terrible. I have brought it to the dealer 4 times and they cant figure out why it shutters at a certain rpm. The transmisson sometimes doesnt know what gear to be in and often luggs. Almost like in a manual transmission if you shift to a higher gear to early. This affects the engine performance. And it doesn't happen all the time which makes it difficult to diagnose. Over all a great truck looks wise and performance when working. Not sure i would buy again if i had the opportunity to because of the problems. Had a 2007 tacoma with over 200'000 miles on it and it ran better and had the same gas milage.","87":"I like most everything about my Colorado with one MAJOR exception.  The automatic transmission will not downshift when attempting to accelerate from low RPM's.  It bogs and acts like a manual transmission that is in too high a gear.  This is especially frustrating in traffic when you are constantly slowing down and speeding up.  When on the highway in cruise control when going uphill it will slow down 2-4 miles per hour before downshifting to maintain the set speed.  Both of these issues increase in severity as the ambient outside temperature increases.  I have had this truck to the dealer four times for this issue and have been told that everything is operating normally.  Not only is it very frustrating but it is also a safety issue.","88":null,"89":"I absolutely love this truck...as long as I don't have to drive it. It is the worst driving experience of any vehicle that I have ever owned. If the \"variable speed transmission\" is the wave of the future, I want nothing to do with it. If Chevy wants to continue using this transmission, there needs to be better communiction to their service managers. I have heard so many lame excuses as to why this transmission is terrible, i.e. \"It's learning your driving style.\", \"It's designed to do that.\", and \"You need to drive a little more aggressive.\" Are you kidding me? So unless you are buying this as a first car for someone who won't know any better, don't waste your money!!!","90":"For those who need a pickup, the Colorado is a great compromise size wise for those who want to park it in their garage and yet still be able to haul stuff.  The Z 71 option has everything but cooled front seats and garage door controls to make the option list complete.  Drives easily and smoothly with v 6 option.  Low 20's combined mpg with mid-to high 20's at highway speeds.  Brakes solid.  Interior space functional for carrying stuff inside, and back seat roomy enough for adults when needed.  A bit pricey compared to full size alternatives, but delivers functionality of a full size with greater driving ease particularly in parking lots.  No mechanical problems yet, only routine maintenance.  Impressed with truck initially and continue to be as I come up on 2 year mark of owning.","91":"Fist of all, Edmunds didn't let me choose the right truck model- LT Extended Cab 4x4 Long Bed with the 3.6L V^ and 6 seed auto.\nI bought my 2015 Colorado becuase I was tired of maneuvering my 2013 Silverado in town and getting just 15.5 MPG. The Colorado still has a 6 foot 2 inch bed, however it is over 15 inches shorter and 6 inches narrower than the fullsize pick-up. Just enough smaller to let the mid-size truck fit into normal parking spaces with some room to spare. The handling and braking are quite good and the 3.6L engine can make the Colorado move quite well, thank you. I drive the truck,not baby it and get very good fuel economy 21.8 mpg average (MPG dropped a bit now as I replaced the OE tires at 30K with a set of Wrangler Adventure W\/Kevlar) in combined driving and up to 26mpg on the highway using 89 Octane gas. My single biggest complaint is the front seats. They are built for short, narrow framed occupants. Also, whey does a truck need a console mounted shifter to take up valuable space? A column shift would be much better. I am impressed with the build quality of the body. My Silverado was full of dash rattles and dour squeaks at just 15K while the Colorado has remained tight and noise free even at 30K. The paint job could be better as it has some visible tiger striping in the metallic. This seems to be a common defect on GM's robot painted vehicles. The 4x4 system and Eaton locking rear differential provide very good traction and the traction\/stability control works quite well without being overly intrusive. I removed the nearly useless rear seats to gain more in cab storage. Only children would fit back there and I don't have any. If you are planning on hauling more than two people-buy the Crew Cab. All things considered, I really like my 2015 Colorado and would buy one again. These trucks are definitely worth a serious look.","92":"As I write this, the truck is back in the repair shop AGAIN.  Problem with the air conditioner freezing up...and in Georgia, the AC is a MUST.  Have had the truck for 8 months.  AC froze up last year and they replaced parts and thought it was repaired.  But, this season we are back to the same problems as last year.  We are also experiencing the same problems as others with the vehicle shuddering as you try to accelerate while already moving.  Of course this is after you press down on the accelerator and nothing happens...until it downshifts and throws you back in your seat.  Really not impressed with the gas mileage either.  Small truck with 6 cyl should do better.  Thought about trading it in on a full sized truck...Best offer is $6,000 less than we paid.  If you really want a small truck, the interior and features are nice...but if you want performance GO BIG.  We are extremely unhappy with the reliability of this vehicle.......UPDATE:  We dumped this vehicle.  Totally UNRELIABLE.","93":"Firstly,  do your self a favor and get the beefier V6 3.6 engine and tow package.  It's only a couple hundred dollars more and it brings the truck from being a mild mannered \"daily commuter\" with some capability, to a truck that that will give many half-ton pickups a run for their money.  There is nothing more embarrassing than when I smoke these fully loaded $35,000+ Z71 Chevy Colorado's on highway with my $25,000+ work truck because I got the V6 and they don't.  \n\nThe extended cab versions are good for fitting extra passengers in a pinch but your friends will thank you for getting the crew cab option especially if your friends are large.  This truck was engineered almost perfectly.  The interior is tough and durable.  There are a lot of hard plastics inside (at least in my truck) but they do not lend themselves to a cheap feeling, rather more of a durable feeling.  Everything inside the truck feels hard and durable with no delicate nobs or buttons which is a huge plus for me.  Everything feels sturdy as it should.  The cabin's interior has a water resistant quality with rubber buttons and nobs that gives one the impression that the trucks electronics would be fine even if the inside got wet.  The acceleration for the truck is quite quick but the automatic transmission is a little....lazy.  It doesn't seem to want to kick the tranny into high gear unless you really put you foot through it.  This truck is most at home cruising on the highway and it is not interested in beating other motorists off the line; even though it certainly can.  This is partially a good thing because it encourages the aggressive driver to ease up a little and saves on MPG.  The trick to going fast (and then some) with this truck is to shift into manual mode and down shift.  Getting in and out of traffic with this truck is a breeze.  This truck can tow with the best of them but it can also (dare I say it) weave in and out of traffic in ways that larger trucks wouldn't dare.\n\nEvery 3.6L Chevy Colorado truck owner knows that they are own something very special.  The small attention to detail is what makes this truck an outstanding choice for mid-sized truck buyers.  This truck brings legitimacy to the mid-sized truck segment and has set the bar for what a Mid sized truck means.  Midsized trucks will no longer be known as trucks whose sole purpose is to haul tools and ladders,they are now a serious option for truck drivers looking to do real work.\n\nWhats great about this truck is its versatility.  It can be used to tow an RV, plow snow, climb a hill, haul cement, go on a date, and race another truck all in one day!  The Chevy Colorado really can do it all.  This truck also gives you a great deal of confidence when you ride it and when you use it.  It's hard to feel   Whether you want a truck for a daily commuter or to do serous work this truck is really the best of both worlds.","94":"I needed to get a WT model rather than the base model to get the rear seats that are, at best, for occasional use.  I elected to get the 6-cylinder engine because I felt that the 4 would be under powered, and there was just 1 mpg difference in fuel economy between the engines.  I don't regret either decision.  The Colorado is a great work truck, with adequate power, and it's quiet.  I'm looking forward to getting years of use from it.  Already, in the first year, I've hauled gravel, mulch, sand, paving stones, wood chips, and cardboard in it. \n\nI also have used it on a week-long camping trip, after purchasing an air mattress that fills the truck's bed, a tent that fits over the truck bed, and another tent that attaches to the first and sits on the ground behind the truck bed.  I really appreciated the driving position of the truck  when I drove for 11 continuous hours to my camping destination.  My actual mileage in the truck is around 20 mpg--a bit less around town and as high as 25 mpg for long stretches of Interstate highways.","95":"Give this truck an extended test drive. Like the truck but HATE the seats. I have 18000 miles on this truck and it's  been pure misury on my back and legs. I don't know what to do because I have invested so much money in this truck that I can't trade for quite a while. I have bought a cushion but that don't help much. Get lots of comments about the great looks. If they only knew.","96":"I've had the truck for 8 months and have 11,000 miles. I've had no major issues at all, no repairs needed. Only minor issue is that the USB port in the front occasionally doesn't read the drive, but that's about it. Gas mileage is 24 highway, 19 or so in he city. 4 wheel drive works great.\n\nAlmost 2 years now, 28,000 miles, still no issues or problems. Love the truck.","97":"The LT model with the premium interior\/exterior and safety packages give this truck the feel of an upscale SUV. Additionally, the gas mileage of the 2.5L engine and 6 speed automatic transmission is great ( routinely 27.5 to 30 mpg highway) for the size of this truck.\n  Update 8\/23\/16 -- After 6+ months of ownership I still love this truck. Yesterday my wife and I took our 2 grandkids (ages 9 and 12) on a 1 hour trip. Everybody was comfortable, Pandora entertained and the trip gas mileage was 30 mpg. The ride and handling is still terrific with great visibility and a big vehicle \"safe feel\" when traveling. Now all 4 of us prefer to take this truck vs our car for trips. I am still very impressed with this vehicle.\n  Update 12\/10\/16 --- Now as the northern Ohio winter starts we are still very impressed with all of the \"handiness\" and features this truck. It still has the original ride and handling feel, great gas mileage on trips and now the heated seats feel really nice.  Another side advantage is the used vehicle pricing of this truck vs my previous car ( my old car's value has dropped over $2,500.00 since it was traded while my truck's value is the same). This truck is still the best bang for the buck on the market. We plan on keeping it a long time !\n  Update 6\/12\/17 --- Back to warm weather year 2. The ride, gas mileage, comfort and ease of use are still great, and the competitor's new mid-size truck offerings still do not compare to this one !","98":"I have owned this truck for a year now and am very satisfied with my purchase. The thing that impressed me the most was the smooth ride it has. As far as power it is sufficient but is no powerhouse. I have had no mechanical issues yet and have put 14,000 miles on it. I have owned two Toyota Tacoma's before this and think that the Colorado compares very well to them.","99":"I bought my truck new from Jerry's Chevy in Baltimore and the truck (with only 20,600 miles) has already had several issues that had to be fixed. While they are covered they are still problems that shouldn't be there! There is a loud whistling that is unfixable according to GM! DO NOT BUY THIS TRUCK. It is a trap. The one good thing is that it has good resale value and the 4x4 is awesome.","100":"I have had my truck for 8 months now.  I have 21,000 miles on it.  I have not had any problems until these past couple of days.  When I turn right I hear a noise under my bed I took it to a dealership Today they said it was my spare tire wasn't tightened.  Got it back still making the noise. I'm taking it back tomorrow to hopefully fix the noise and also I have a recall on it that is going to take 3 hours to fix.   Other than that I love my truck.  I'm a mom with 2 little girls 5 and 6 and they love my truck too.  Not alot of room in the front but alot in the back.  My truck got up to 29 mpg.  Average is 25mpg.  I got heated seats with my truck.  They suck.  They don't get hot.  I really have no complaints except this noise it's making now.  I hope they get it fixed soon.","101":"Truck is beautiful. We have a very bad shutter when excelerating from low speed. Also have trouble with brakes grabbing. GM says it is normal and there is nothing they can do. We do not feel safe in the vehicle. If you are looking at this GM product, I suggest you look at something else.","102":"First the good:  \nThe look of the Colorado is excellent. I think it is a very attractive truck.  The options are great also. The one that I owned was loaded with all of the bells and whistles. The Dealership and Service Department was great also. (I just had to see them too much.)\nNow the bad:\nI also experienced the crazy shifting and total under powering of the truck as mentioned in other posts (The one I owned had the 6 cylinder in it). Several safety recalls, and having the torque converter changed out at 3,600 miles to try to correct the shifting problem, left me very disappointed in the Colorado. The dealer that I worked with was very understanding when I informed them that I did not buy a new vehicle to stay in the Service Department. I had an old car that was paid off if this was what I was interested in.  Unfortunately, I decided to trade the truck in on a different vehicle. I had the truck 8 months, and felt like I would be better off just getting rid of the headache. Hopefully Chevrolet will get the bugs worked out in the coming years, but they totally missed the mark on this truck.","103":"Had truck almost a yr now and had no problems with anything.  I have just over 13,000 miles now.  The only thing I don't like is the Chevy MyLink.  I'm not going to pay extra money every month for Navigation that sux.  My Garmin is way better and its paid for.\n  Had truck for 2 yrs now and still no problems.","104":"The other reviews I have read are nowhere near my experience. I have owned this truck for a year and I absolutely love it. The fuel economy is tremendous and the overall value of the truck has been terrific. The MyLink is a little wonky at times, but the overall driving experience of the truck far surpasses that of the 2012 Silverado that I owned before this truck.","105":"It is a nice ride with a transmission problem that should have never been in any new vehicle. The shift and spike in rpm during shifts is a disgrace. I had it cut off on me the other day. It started back up but it leaves me worried about when will that become an issue. I have had several Chevy cars and trucks in my life but this is my last.","106":"I have owned this truck for 7 months now. I'm about to take it to the mechanic for the 5th time. The first month I had it the radio, back up camera, blinker clicks, horn honk, and USB port went out. At month 4 the ac went out. The transmission skips when you are doing a constant speed, the dealership told me it's because the \"gears are wound so tightly the truck is having a hard time figuring out what gear to be in.\" The radio and back up camera have went out a total of 8 times, every time I take it in they say nothing is wrong when they run their diagnostics. I'm paying 600$ a month for a truck that runs like crap! I will NEVER buy another Chevy as long as I live. Save yourself the headache! The headlights went out tonight. So I have a truck less than a year old that I can't drive at night. This truck is a nightmare!","107":"Engine misfired at idle and occasionally stalled.  Driver power window repeatedly failed despite being reprogrammed by dealer.  Multiple cosmetic problems - gas door always slightly ajar, hood not even, etc.  4WD would \"stick\" and required turning car off and restarting to shift back to 2WD. Three recalls requiring service - seats not attached properly, hood fluttered at highway speed, and power steering required reprogramming.  All of this occurred before 15,000 miles.  Mediocre performance. I traded for a more reliable truck made by a company that did not accept government bail out money.","108":"Let me start off by saying I had a 2013 Chevy spark after seven times to fix the air condition they bought it back under lemon law under the condition that they ask me to buy another chevy which I did I got A 2015 work truck Chevy Colorado well this is definitely POS I had to go to the dealership several times the transmission ships very awkwardly on the highway I've already problems with the speed sensor and traction control which has shorted out due to the rain which makes no sense.. it was also missing annoyed silent boot on a the engine which made it sound I like the engine was in the truck with me while I was driving.. and also the hood shakes and moves a lot on the highway looks like it wants to come off shame on you general motor.. if I wanted junk I would have gone to the junkyard","109":"I researched this truck for months before seeing in person and test driving. I didn't want a full-size due to my urban lifestyle but wanted the benefits of having a truck for towing\/hauling when the time comes. The truck is amazing, no complaints at all. The engine, drive-train, mileage, ride, technology...etc all speaks for it self. I'm 6'3 (200 lbs) and I can fit in the truck easily with great comfort. I constantly receive compliments about her, she's a real GM gem.","110":"I ordered a 2015 Chevy Colorado back in August 2014 and waited 93 days until it was delivered.  I received my 2015 Z71 Extended Cab 3.6L on December 3 2014 and as of October 20, 2015 I currently only have 7,300 miles.  I am right under 6'3\" and the truck is not designed for anyone over 6' tall.  I can not have my arm and elbow out the window when the windows are down and the aero dynamics makes you feel like your in a wind tunnel with the slightest breeze with the windows down.  I still have not had over 19 MPG in the 10+ months I have owned this truck and the transmission is a completely new issue with not enough room here to write about.  It will randomly shift between gears when driving on a flat plane.  It will drop down 2 gears when you try to pass another vehicle, resulting in the RPM's to redline and the MPH not even increasing all while jerking you around the cab.  I also purchased the leather - fully adjustable seats which leaves much to be desired.  The seat will only lower so far and of lowering farther, it will just lean back resulting in a very uncomfortable sit and blind spots from the rear view mirror.  I would not recommend anyone to buy one of these trucks without test driving it for at least a full 24 hours in every imaginable scenario you would ever be in.  I am just trying to pay mine down enough and keep miles off to sell it and not loose the 3 1\/2 years of saving of $14k I put down on it.","111":"I've been driving the crap out of this truck.  Commuting, towing a small camper, back roading in Colorado, carrying people...  Not a single mechanical complaint.  Numerous comments from passengers that the ride is unexpectedly good.  Lower wind noise than expected...  I never had infotainment stuff before.  It works fine.  Love the backup camera.  With a cap on the back it is a must-have.  Still getting used to the length.  The long wheel base long bed crew is just as long as a full size truck.  The front bumper finish seems a little delicate.  I have several nicks from bugs or whatever that have gone though the beautiful red paint and now black is showing.  Also, as everyone says, the air dam is aweful for a 4WD.  Scraped it several times driving mild 4WD road. UPDATE-10 months and 25,000 miles later. Running great, but GM is not interested in addressing the design flaw with the front air dam. The owners manual says to remove it if you're going to take it off road. You can't do it without disassembling the whole front end. Apparently the off-road package is for looks only. GM customer service blew me off.  They have no fix for this design flaw and threaten a voided warranty if I just remove it. I'm very disappointed with GM.","112":"This was my dream truck I waited for a long time and saved and worked and saved and finally after I found it at my local dealership with everything I wanted I finally got to take it home and I've just been mildly impressesd all the electronics extras cost extra. Now my $500 a month truck payment is $600 a month. Ive taken it to the dealership 5 times in 4 months. Ill be honest my last car was a used BMW 325i. Maybe Im new to the truck market and this is to be expected. My buddy who has the Top of the Line Ford F150 Platinum 4 x4  says my truck is awesome but Ive had so many problems and for a 4 month old truck Im wondering how the hell is this thing going to make it 60 months????? My seats are ripping after 4k miles on a Z71. I would have take leather for what I'm paying. The rear end clicks when I push the gas pedal at a stand still.... answer from chevy \"oh thats normal there needs to be play in the rear end\" really because the 3 other late model El Camino's Ive owned never had play in the rear end! They were built 20 years ago!! I'm still a proud Chevy owner but I'm just pissed that the brand has fallen so far. Do I need to buy the Silverado Z71 that doesn't look off road worthy at all? Am I crazy The Z71 Silverado doesn't look like it could handle any sort of off road conditions. Don't even get me started about the wind damn in the front of the truck. Ive almost ripped that thing off on curbs. You want me to get this thing stuck Ill come back missing half the damn plastic just from my normal hiking spot. I asked the dealership hey can you take that off? His reply was \" Oh you wanted to take this truck off road\"? Well it might void your warranty? Really? Because the whole reason I bought this damn truck was to get to the trailheads I couldn't get to with my damn foreign car! Im Legitimately concerned about my truck making it to the 60 month mark. Thats not what american cars, especially trucks are built on and I feel cheated. This might be my reality, but Ill tell you this I didn't work [non-permissible content removed] to cheated for some hard earned steal and muscle that I feel I deserve.","113":"I have owned a Tacoma and a Frontier. Both were great trucks. The Colorado is the best truck I have had. It is comfortable. Smooth ride. Outstanding interior. Awesome exterior. The technology is top rate. I love driving it. I have received a lot of people checking it out and asking me about it. I am very happy with my purchase and would encourage others to buy a Chevy.","114":"Lest start with this - Mine is a Z71 with 275 70 R17 Cooper AT3 tires, a 2 & 1 lift\/level kit.  I test drove 2 of these set up that way (The way a truck should sit with real rubber).  Other than that the typical stuff on a loaded Z71.  Very clean and refined buggy, A few little tweaks would be great in the future.\n\nIt rides and handles like a truck should - after the mods.  Much better than the Silverado and it looks good.  Comfort is great, Mileage is real world and very good - Absolutely love it.\n\nLIKES: Mileage, Power, Comfort\n\nDISLIKES: Tranny seems to search at times, No Heated Mirrors, No Electric Sliding Rear Window","115":"I've own Toyota, Ford and Honda  trucks and  this by far is  best truck I have owned.  It is quiet, smooth and has plenty of power. \r\n\r\nPeople are always stopping me and complimenting its looks. Gary Russ Chevrolet - Cadillac gave me an outstanding deal. ","116":"I purchased the truck after driving all the similar midsized competition.  It was the only one we could fit a infant baby seat in.  I received the truck Feb 25th 2015. April 17th it overheated and stranded me and my 2 daughters.  It was 70f outside and I was just idling waiting on my wife.  God forbid I actually tow something with it.","117":"I have a major gripe with the GPS system in my Colorado. It is a $495.00 option that is a total waste of money. The easy one first: The voice activation is terrible....period. Secondly I am using my portable GPS onstead of the installed GPS. Why you ask? Simple: I have a $100 TomTom and a FREE GPS App in my IPhone that work so much better. I actually set the IPhone on the ledge of the Navigation screedn. Half the time I only want to enter a city, not an address. With this GPS I cannot do this. I need to enter a specific address. Also, I ask for a restaurant as a POI, and I get \"Racetrack gas station\". I am in the process of fighting GMC for a refund. I cannot write other issues: no more room","118":"Love the truck. had it over 1 mo now. Have fully loaded z71 package but would like to see two things, heated side mirrors (really? common chevy) and second, collision and lane departure options available to z71 trim. i built the truck online and NOWHERE at the time did it say these safety options were only available to LT trim. When you clicked each trim it said you get everything from the trim before plus additional items. My fault for not confirming at the dealership but again, why wouldnt you make this available for your top trim. Thats like making leather only available for base model. ","119":"  My valves rattle when shifting like I have bad gas, when I run chevron 87 or 91 octaine. Its the v6 3.6","120":"We primarily wanted a lighter weight pickup truck that we could flat-tow behind a Winnebago class-A motorhome. The new Colorado does this in spades. To keep weight and complexity down, as well as cost, the extended cab and 4-cyl was our best choice. \n\nThe 4-cyl is very smooth and quiet as long as you are not in a hurry. If you mash the pedal or like to drive fast then this is not for you. Around town it keeps up with traffic, it is not designed for towing heavy loads over mountain passes. \n\nThe new build quality is outstanding, looks very euro or japanese under the hood. The ride is very smooth and it's amazingly quiet. \n\nThis one is a home-run.\n\nEDIT: Edmunds sent out a request to re-visit and update my review after two years with the vehicle. I'm still just as impressed with this as the day I bought it, it has been very good. \n\nThere have been three or four minor recalls, and zero warranty claims. Absolutely no failures whatsoever. Fit and finish is excellent, no wear points. \n\nSome owners have complained about balky shifting, however I have found overall it works as designed - some fault the way it shifts up to a higher gear and locks up the TC to conserve fuel. If you're trying to mash the pedal and get it to shift down at the same time it can take longer than some expect. For around town driving I use manual mode and leave it in 4 or 5 so it cannot shift all the way to 6th. This solves that issue and it works very well otherwise. \n\nThe I4 is no powerhouse, but it's adequate even on the freeway. We have since acquired a boat that is about 2500lbs on it's trailer - the truck easily pulls this load even on mountain grades. \n\nI just installed new all-terrain tires (Cooper Adventurer\/Discoverer) as I wanted AT type tires from the beginning but could not get a reasonable trade in for the new take-offs, even when they were under 100miles. So after two years decided to just spend the money - it rides so much nicer than the GY Wrangler Fortitudes it comes with. \n\nAll in all very happy with this truck. Oh, and have towed it a couple of thousand miles with the RV and it does just fine - absolutely zero issues. It has now traveled to four states and plenty of short-commuting miles.","121":"Review updated 12\/31\/16\nThis truck replaced a Nissan Frontier. I don't need a full size truck, so sadly my alma matter, Ford, was out as they killed off the Ranger 3 years ago. I have had the truck a week and like it. We drove a 700 mile trip through the mountains and averaged 23.5 mpg going 70 mph with 4 people and bed full. The Nissan on the same trip averaged 19.3 mpg. Truck is very quiet and comfortable. The fit and finish inside and out are first rate. I have not used the 4X4 or towed yet, but with 7000 lbs capacity it should do well. Overall, after a week and 1000 miles, I would recommend it. I was going to wait on the diesel, but after comparing potential costs vs. return, the gas V-6 was the better buy. \n\nUpdate 12\/31\/2016\nThe bad - I have owned this truck 2 years now and 27K miles, and sadly it has not been reliable and I just can't recommend the Colorado. It has been in a Chevy dealer for warranty repairs for over 35 days of the 2 years of ownership. Problems include, OnStar Module, 4WD electronic transfer case replaced twice, hood vibrating at highway speeds replaced twice and still has minor vibration, poor paint quality on roof, engine spark knocking under light load, transmission has higher pitched hum at 50-60 mph and hard shifting under light load, heater completely went out, A\/C went out twice, ignition had to be replaced do the key getting so hot you could not touch it, brakes squeaking when cold, and the most annoying, a clicking sound in the steering column that GM engineering has yet to come up with a fix for that is related to the airbag, not to mention multiple recalls. The bright spot has been the dealer support, Autosport Chevrolet in Hackettstown NJ. They have been very helpful through all these problems and kept in contact with GM engineering to resolve most of the issues and I can't say enough good things about them!\n\nThe good - The reasons I purchased the truck have led me to want to try and keep it with the hopes that before the warranty period ends the issues will be resolved. It gets great mileage for a gas truck (been averaging 22.5 combined city\/highway), its very comfortable, roomy and quiet. The infortainment and navigation are first rate. So if you decide to purchase a Colorado my recommendation is to buy the GM extended warranty. There are a lot of Colorado's on the road now and mine was one of the first ones produced, and the build quality was just not adequate, others have had good experiences with later production trucks.","122":"Good basic 4 wheel drive truck, but not really small or mid size; darn close to our Sierra. Love the rear view camera. I only have 1,500 miles on it, but the gas mileage is only 17 around town and 24 highway. The 4 wheel drive has to be switched on manually and doesn't engage automatically when conditions require it. The lack of a CD player is compensated for by the 4 USB ports, although 2 are accessible from in the back seat. The seat heat seems to be a warmer at best, no real heat in the cold weather. Remote starting is a great feature, although we have only had the opportunity to warm the truck and not cool it. The GPS system is a wast of money, its like a 1990s Garmin. Adequately powered","123":"Had this truck a week so far so good\r\nThey crew cab is apprx 6 inches longer than my regular cab Silverado   so not as small as people would think \r\n\r\nI previously had a 2007 Colorado\r\nthis is 1000 percent improvement","124":"This truck has been everything I exctpected and more. I traded in a 2012 Hyundai Sonata that I really enjoyed but this truck has been so much better. The ride is very smoth and quiet. It is a tiny bit tight inside but afterall this is the Colorado and not Silverado, it's to be expected. \nAfter owning it for well over a year now and putting 40,000 miles on it I have a better feel. The only thing that really sucks is I love driving this truck and the warranty is no longer valid since I have passed 32,000 miles which was supposed to last three years. At this point any maintenance is extremely expensive through the dealership like usual. The maintenance schedule is more demanding than any other car I've owned. I still love this truck. I just do not like the warranty","125":"Ii WAS THE FIRST ONE TO BUY THE 2015 COLORADO IN NORTHERN VA. LOVE THIS TRUCK I WAITED 2 YEARS FOR THIS TRUCK TO COME OUT AND IT WAS WORTH IT. YOU TRUCK GIRLS THIS IS THE TRUCK FOR YOU","126":"priced right","127":"It is not an easy in\/out for us older folks, not a lot of space to get in, it is a really big step and the hand hold to grab onto is at a very strange angle.  Seats not especially comfortable for a long trip, and the seats are narrow for my big hubby with the size 52 shoulders.  There is a terrible blind spot when backing up with the headrest and the wide piece of the frame between the windows that you cannot see especially to the right. It has been good in the snow although we do put some extra weight in the back for the winter. It sits up fairly high for good driving visibility, better gas mileage than our other truck, mid size easier to handle and fits better in the garage.  The price was a better value than others. We have had it 2 years and have had no major mechanical issue.","128":"I,m pushing 60 yrs old and am a mild driver----12,500 miles- right rear main seal failed, rotor, pads, caliper and seal all had to be replaced.    22,500 miles- check engine light on.   Emissions system failed,     canister, vent valve, filler pipe and bolt all need to be replaced.    All of the above was covered under warranty but what happens at 36,000 miles ?  you pay.    Too much risk to keep this vehicle past the warranty period.    Probably be my last Nissan,  Too bad because it could be a good old school truck.","129":"When first bought ,had  oil leak, repaired, then fuel leak, repaired, then bad engine mounts, replaced(all under warrantee) now at 27,000 miles,now transmission slipping, going back dealer,   Dealer is great, would buy from them again","130":"I think this is a great truck. It is a great value compared to the Tacoma and the Colorado which is overpriced in my opinion.  There are not many small trucks to choose from anymore. I get an average of 16 mpg city and 19 hwy. if you are looking for gas mileage, this is not the vehicle for you. It is a very solid and strong feeling truck and you sit up higher than you would think. The front seats are very comfortable, I would not want to sit in the back of the extended cab (king cab) with the seats that flip down. Its great for 2 people but if you have kids I would go for a crew cab. I feel like I am in a full sized truck. I paid around $35k when everything was said and done and that includes a 100k warranty and all taxes.  I like the way it looks and I think the interior is nice, my only complaint is no auto headlights! what is up with that? I have to remember to turn on my lights which I haven't had to do in years. otherwise it has everything one would need. Navigation, back up camera, Bluetooth, heated seats, that's all I could ask for. I would highly recommend. I Would like to add, my husband is 6'3 and 220 and he is very comfortable in this truck.","131":"I have just under 21K miles on the truck. Last year the dealership replaced the alternator, and last week they replaced the AC compressor because the clutch was so harsh you could hear the growl down the block.  Now the power steering pump needs to be replaced according to the dealer.  I wouldn't buy another one, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.","132":"I purchased this vehicle because my old 11 year old vehicle was starting to get expensive on repairs, after own my Frontier for 16 months I find that this 2015 Nissan is no bargain. Every time I bring it in for it's service intervals dealership finds problems, moisture in the brake fluid flush and replace this was at 18500 miles.  Next at 21500 mile rear brakes worn out, front brakes about nearing replacement.  My old vehicle 44000 miles on it before fronts needed to be replaced the rear brakes where fine. I am now looking for a vehicle that will not be a Nissan.","133":"I have had my Nissan truck for a year and a half and it has 43500 miles on it.  I commute 48 miles each way to work.  The gas mileage is on average about 16MPG.  I purchased this truck for a couple of reasons.  After a bunch of negotiation, I got the price down to $27,300 which is about as low as it gets for a nicely loaded 4x4 truck.  You probably could do better due to every other manufacturer that makes one having an updated small truck.  The interior craftsmanship is poor.  The glove box\/door panels are susceptible to scratching and the center console latch broke very early on.  I had the same issue with my wife's Nissan Quest.  The dash rattles.  The rear doors don't close well.  The seats are comfy (I'm 6'04\" - 240 lbs), seat warmers are nice and the web material is nice but the back seat is way too small for long trips with even small-medium sized passengers.  I have three kids and I shuttle them to and from school so it works out.  Longer trips, they are complaining.  The storage under the rear seat is nice.  I just got back from vacation and found a puddle of rain water inside the truck.  The antenna for the XM radio has come loose and water leaked into the truck from the roof.  Luckily, no headliner damage.  The dealer wouldn't fix it despite being 18 months old because of the mileage and neither will Nissan.  (Nissan has poor customer service.)  Oddly, it doesn't have an oil change meter.  I use the second trip odometer.  The truck runs wells, has good power.  For a rear wheel drive truck, it handles well.  The ABS works great (I had some evasive driving recently and was impressed.)  I have the rails in the truck bed and they are a nice option.  For what I paid for it, it works well.  When I added gasoline and maintenance estimates, it was by far cheaper than the Colorado or the Toyota.","134":"This is a great truck.  Not fancy but it's reliable,  fun,  built well,  and still looks great.  Plenty of power from the 4.0l motor,  perfect offroading, and plenty of cargo space.  Love my Frontier pro4x","135":"Had my 1993 Nissan last me for 22 years & it was the most reliable truck I ever owned. That is why I purchased this one because it is very close to my old one. Base S model, 4 cylinder , 5 speed manual,  with  typical upgrades of ABS, speed control, CD player, etc.","136":"I was looking for a truck that would replace my present vehicle, the one that I have driven successfully for 44 years. I doubt that Nissan would qualify. The six cylinder engine has an iron block - but it has aluminum heads - so given the different rates of expansion\/contraction, head gasket failure was inevitable, eventually.  The \"timing chain\" was much better than the \"timing belt,\" but Nissan has faulty timing gears and a poor rating for servicing what they build - another negative. After rationalizing these detriments, I could not get a manual transmission to go with the six cylinder engine, which soured the deal completely. Lastly, I was left wondering what the parts\/repair situation would look like fifteen years from now, so I have opted out of \"new\" trucks, and I will be looking for something older that \"may\" be more durable and offer me a few more good years. \"The jury is still out\" on the benefits of \"older verses newer\" and on \"which truck might serve my needs.\" It may be a bit like looking for a Baptist preacher in the Vatican - doomed from the start.","137":"My new 4X4 Frontier SL crew cab has every option available with the long bed & 4.0L engine. I looked at the new Chevy\/GMC and Toyota Tacoma and I went with the new 2015 Frontier SL 4X4 LB crew cab. This Frontier is a rock solid mid size pickup. Its 4.0L engine will last for many decades if properly maintained. I love the leather interior, heated seats and outstanding stereo with navigation. The engine is very strong. The only draw back to this pickup, is its gas mileage, but the reliability of this pickup a long with its 6.1 foot long bed and great pricing made the choice easy. The frame under the pickup bed on the Frontier looks twice as stout as the new Chevy\/GMC frame under their small pickup beds, and the Frontier has 4 wheel disc  brakes, you can't get that on the Toyota, and rear drum brakes are a real pain to maintain in the N.E. Ohio. I easily fitted a full size 8 foot couch in the rear truck bed with the tailgate down and used the Frontier's adjustable tie down system to securely hold the new couch for the trip home. This is a real stout mid size pickup with steel bumpers front, and rear only on the SL model. \n\nI highly recommend this mid size pickup.","138":"had a2008 ford f-150 and u can quote me on this . this frontier is like a tiger tank vs. a outdated grant tank  when comparing the frontier sv v-6 to the f-150 v-6 . the ford was repair almost daily . the frontier is all I ever expected it to be. great truck. just the right size and it fits into the garage without having to get out and closing the mirrors. well worth the cost of buying .","139":"I had a 2008 Frontier SV Crew-Cab 4X4 4.0L 6cyl 5A truck, loved it. Once I sold it, bought this one: 2015 SV CC 4X4 4.0L 6cyl 5A with Value Package, no Nav. Great truck, except for the bluetooth. It always defaults to automatically replying to text messages (Nissan Consumer Affairs and the dealership both acknowledge that this is a defect), but Consumer Affairs will not provide any support\/update\/fix, other than \"We are aware.\" Test out your phone's connection before you sign on the dotted line.\n\nLike I said, love the truck, except for the faulty software programming and the significant lack of support from Nissan.","140":null,"141":null,"142":"The Rockford Fosgate  System has problems with Bluetooth and Navigation in my 2015 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab.\nThere are times after starting the engine, and I try to make  a call (on an Android phone) using the \"voice\" option, it will bring up the name I requested but the wrong set of phone numbers, yes, somehow it looses the link between the name and its associated phone numbers!!! Other times its works just fine.\nThe other problem is with the navigation system dropping out when I hit a bump (in the middle of it giving directions). This has happened intermittently.\nAs of October 26th 2015, there are no firmware updates planned.\nRockford Fosgate is supposed to be a superior system, so far I am not impressed.","143":"This is my third 2nd gen Nissan. I had a 06 Xterra (same platform) with 186000 trouble free miles on it. I traded for a loaded 12 pro4x xterra. I put 35000 miles on that in 1 yr. Now to the Frontier. I traded off the xterra as I needed to haul cans of gas and diesel for work.  My first experience is the truck is a little more bouncier than the xterra but not bad at all. gas mileage is less on the fronty as well. I avg about 18 on the fronty where 20 was the norm on the X. I'm Mr. cruise control and I keep a fuel record. I like everything about the fronty so far and the 8 way seat makes a long haul a non issue. I'm 49 and 6' 225 muscular build and I feel fine behind the wheel. I just wish they would add a telescoping wheel to the list on the next gen. as well as the diesel. I haven't had the chance to off road the frontier but I am sure it is as capable as the Xterra and it was quite the mountain goat. I have hauled my ZRX1200R a couple of times in the bed. Although it is a little short the rail system is awesome. I also have towed my M109R on my Kendon trailer and it pulls with ease. Probably around 1200 pounds. I did notice some mileage drop off though, which I never saw on the xterra while pulling my bike. I would also like to add that these trucks hold their value well . So in closing these are some things I would like to see on a new generation.\n1. Bring on that diesel. I just came back from the Dominican republic and they have a diesel. What engine I don't know\n2. Telescoping steering wheel\n3. Keep the truck looking like a truck and not a damn crossover vehicle\n4, Update the interior materials. get rid of the super easy to scratch plastics  and find a softer version \n5, A better center rest and better door arm rest please","144":"The Nissan Frontier is an old school truck. As many have pointed out it's an old design and there are roomier and more modern competitors to consider. But in Pro-4X trim this old school truck becomes an off road warrior. Including the luxury package adds electronically adjustable leather seats with heaters, leather interior, sunroof, and a rugged roof rack.\n\nFor a truck that you're taking into the wilds, old school isn't a bad thing. The engine and drive system has been proven and improved upon over the past decade. The 4.0 V6 has power to spare, and the part time 4 wheel drive includes HI and LO ranges, locking rear differential, and hill start\/hill descent control. I have no worries that this truck will take me there and back again without complaint.\n\nFit and finish are top notch. While the NissanConnect system doesn't like to play nice with an iPhone, the rest of the audio\/navigation system works very well. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is as good as they come, with excellent sound quality and plenty of bass you can rock out while you're climbing over rocks and boulders.\n\nThis is my 3rd Frontier (and have had 2 Xterra's in the past) so I know what these trucks are capable of. When it came down to getting my next vehicle, and in light of the new Tacoma and Frontier's coming out at the end of the year, this was the truck I wanted. It provides the most bang for the buck and I know it's a solid investment that will last for many years of on and off road adventure. The new trucks will be nice, more luxurious, and a LOT more expensive. Do you really want to invest $40k on something that you intend to get down and dirty with? Not to mention that they'll be working out the kinks in the new models for a while.\n\nUPDATE FEBRUARY 2017:\nNothing much to complain about after driving the truck for 18 months and almost 28,000 miles. The stock Hankook Dynapro ATM tires have grown a bit louder, but that seems to be the norm for all-terrain tires. Other than regular maintenance the vehicle has been perfect. Still rock solid, no rattles, fit and finish remain excellent. Maintenance costs have been extremely low, especially considering I only have it serviced at my local dealer. Not sure if the low cost is just for this dealer, or reflects generally low maintenance costs for this vehicle.\n\nOffroad capabilities are as expected. Excellent. And on-road manners are quite civilized (other than the slight growl from the A\/T tires). Mileage typically varies from 17.5 - 18.5 MPG.\n\nThe factory nav\/audio system has an occasional glitch, and sometimes freezes up, but easily remedied by a hard reset of the system (holding down power button for several seconds). It may be somewhat overwhelmed trying to deal with the 10,000 songs on my iPhone.\n\nSince purchasing the Frontier I've had the opportunity to review all the new truck models. While there are newer and more modern trucks available, the Frontier remains an excellent choice, offering as many (if not more) premium features for fewer dollars.","145":"Purchased my first new vehicle, Nissan Frontier SV 4x4 Crew Cab.  So far I have had 3 problems, Nissan has only covered one...\r\n\r\n1. No hole drilled for air conditioner drain.  Water leaked all over the interior and blew out of every vent.  Nissan \"fixed\" this.\r\n\r\n2. The \"paint\" on the rear wheel wells is literally falling off after 5,000 miles.  After several frustrating attempts Nissan refuses to fix this.

The rear sonar now no longer works @ 8,000 miles.  \r\n\r\nNissan has basically told me \"No\" several times to the paint, claiming its environmental.  I live on a normal street, happened at 5000 miles. ","146":"The truck is fun to drive, has excellent acceleration, decent gas mileage but is very noisy. Not wind noise but road noise. Can barely hear radio unless it's above 15 on the volume scale and higher than that if the AC is on high. It is like they forgot to install the insulation.","147":"the leg room if a car or booster seat in back.is none for passenger.the radio is fair.only bluetooth streaming for ipod's.aux port for android phone's is ok.but expected better for year.other than my issues with frontier,its very nice truck.","148":"I traded in a well-worn but very reliable 2003 Toyota Tundra base model with regular cab, 5-speed manual transmission and a 3.4 liter V6 engine. I'd badly injured my left foot in a falling accident and kicking the clutch was painful. I love Toyotas, but the price on the used Tacomas was too much for my budget. Enter a well-maintained 2014 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab with the SV package.  While not as big as the Tundra, the Frontier was quite comfortable and its automatic transmission and cruise control were blessings to my injured left foot. I also found the Frontier tracked well in its lane rather than wandering the way my Tundra had. The only fault was in the limited rear view along the driver's side of the car via the door-mounted rearview mirror. After a few hair-raising moments I learned to lean forward and look back along the driver's side of the truck to watch out for traffic. Once I got used to that it wasn't a problem. I love the 4.0 liter V6 engine, which offers 60-plus more horsepower than I had in my Tundra.  No more being left behind at the stop light by everybody else (including grandma). I bought the truck in December 2016 with just under 35,000 miles on it. I saved a good $8,000 to $9,000 compared to a new car. Do I see that as a great deal? Oh yes--Nissan trucks are made to last and I saved a lot more than I gave up by purchasing a late-model used pickup. The previous owners clearly maintained the vehicle well. Also, the built-in towing package is a plus as my wife and I--both in our 60s--are ready to trade tent-camping for the comforts of a trailer. The more I drive this truck, the more I like it. And while I would have preferred a gray-colored truck, the shiny black highlighted with chrome bumpers, sidesteps, etc., is definitely a \"sexy\" combination.   I worried about going from Toyota to Nissan, but both companies make great vehicles. Like the old saying, \"You pays your money and you takes your choice.\"","149":"This is another winner from Nissan.After owning a used 1993 Hardbody D21,I was determined to upgrade to a crew cab Nissan Frontier (my Hardbody smoked my old Toyota,with way better off road performance).This truck even impressed my wife,who hated my old Toyota,with comfortable seating (we're short people),logical controls,and especially visiblity.The model we bought lacks power windows and power door locks,but after our hunting trip to eastern Oregon,in which we locked ourself out a couple of times in the Chevy,I can do without such conveniences.Be prepared to battle the dealerships,who will way overprice these popular trucks.Arm yourself with Internet knowledge and roll up your sleeves and be prepared for a three hour ordeal.We got close to our target price.We love this truck.I added a receiver hitch,that required no drilling of the frame (WOW) to mount.Update:so far a great little truck,absolutely no problems,and does everything we expected.","150":"Hard to find the Pro4x in a full extra cab, especially in any color other than white\/black\/silver...  So never found one. Looking in Southern Oregon now.","151":"Engine idles rough , lot of vibration . Front seat rattles ,dealer repaired , still rattles. Climate control difficult to regulate . Slow to warm in the winter. Wanders from side to side , loud when driving .","152":null,"153":"I have a 2014 Frontier at 32000 miles transmission started to slip within five miles no transmission.

Service director wanted me to test drive him and show issues I was now having, Heat plate rattle, grinding fourth gear clutch already wearing out and lets not forget the crease in the passenger door, Service director thanked me for knowing how to drive a stick. Gee only 30 years driving one. Now its in the shop see what they say this time. 1 year and already 1700 maintenance for an issue that wasn't my fault! Is it the hydraulic system to clutch? \nYesterday another 2014 coasts into gas station 27000 No transmission clutch smell months later a new clutch flywheel. Then rebuilt transmission back at mossy Nissan for pressure plate and throw out bearing. Just over 40k.","154":"I had a 2004 Frontier king cab.  It was spartan and handled kind of rough, but the thing was a tank and I had very little problems with it.  I traded it in at a 170k miles.  Having kids I knew I needed more of an actual back seat, I got a used 2014 Frontiet sv trim line crew cab.  So far I love it!  The V6 engine has great \"gitty-up\" and power.  It's handling\/turning may not be its strong suit, but it's a truck, not a sports car.  Not sure this is most truck's strong suits.  Overall I love the look of truck, sporty and brawny, while maintaining some refinement.  Understand that this is a mid-size vehicle, so there are lots of bigger trucks with way more cargo and back seat space.  But not wanting a school bus sized vehicle for a truck, this is a perfect size.  Certainly if you do lots of hauling, especially heavy duty, look elsewhere.  But for around town with some hauling, this truck fits the bill.  Also some people knock the mpg, but again, it's a truck!","155":"Bought this as a more cost effective and less 'garage filling' replacement for my 2000 Silverado. Interior fit and finish is great, good visibility and lots of power. A\/C works well which is appreciated in TX. Cons: this truck gets 16.5 MPG city and about 20.5 highway - way less than my old 4.8 L Silverado which got 19.5\/23 over 170K miles with a larger and more powerful engine. The Frontier is a miserable highway truck as you have to compensate for every little wind gust and it will hydroplane easily compared to the other trucks I have owned. There is also a 'clunk' in the driveline which I have noted in not only my but other Frontiers when taking off from a stop. Still, it is a good value for an 'in town hauler' if you do not need a longer 6' bed.","156":"I purchased my 2014 Nissan Frontier Pro 4x brand new 01\/11\/14. I have 53,567 miles on it already and will tell you this, never buy Nissan! on board computer-junk, locks up, loses connection with my phone, and the whole \"pay attention to the road\" sign could not be more irritating! I drive mostly highway, on cruise control...I have NEVER seen 21 MPG EVER!! The most important factor in selecting this vehical. They somehow neglect to inform you when you purchase the truck of all the mileage related \"maintenance\" that needs performed. In the 15 months I have owned the truck the dealers have soaked me for over $2000.00!! REALLY!!? I still need tires!  \n\nI now have 110000 on the truck. The computer is still junk, and they want $150 to upgrade the map. I haven't gotten the 100000 maintenance yet and my wallet is terrified. The serpentine belt is squealing quite loudly, and with all the internal fluids that will I'm sure \"need changed\" I have no doubt a $1000+ bill is in my future. \n I put a 3\" lift and 33\" tires on the truck. With the bad, I will say the good; I can't get it stuck. I also highly suggest a cold air intake system, it really helped increase power.","157":"Traded my F150 for the Frontier due to size considerations. I just don't need a full size truck 365 days a year. Maybe twice a year but that's about it. \r\nI have about 1500 miles on the Fronty, like the size, styling and acceleration. MPG is only about 16.5 mpg with 75% highway driving. So it's averaging about 1.5 less than my 2wd F150 with a V6. But the engine is still breaking in so hopefully the mileage will increase.\r\nMore engine noise in the cabin than the F150 but it's not bad.\r\nF150 seats were\/are way better than the Frontier. The Frontier seats need more thigh support and longer seat bottom. ","158":"Purchased our Frontier about a week ago.  Very pleased so far.  Ours also has the Value package which includes the bed track system, backup camera and automatic a\/c.  \r\n\r\nV6 is smooth and powerful, with excellent acceleration.  Interior is comfortable, and feels roomier than the new Colorado.  Materials are nice and have quality feel.  We like the fold up rear seats, which provide a flat floor with the removable storage bins.  Storage in the backseat of the Colorado is not removable.\r\n\r\nUtility track system is well designed and included spray on bed liner-an excellent value.\r\n\r\nComparably equipped Chevy would be much more expensive, and the Frontier has a proven record of reliability.   ","159":"I've always owned full size Chevy or Dodge p\/ups. Now that kids are moved on it was time to downsize. I needed to still have the pulling power to haul a trailer and car, as well as true 4wd (not AWD) capabilities. Looked at the Honda (no locking 4wd over certian speeds) and Toyota (less towing, HP and MPG) and settled for the Nissan. I'm very happy with my choice. Recently towed a Boxter hour and half and couldn't have been happier. The truck towed without hesitation. The power was more than adequate and the ride was great.\r\nI hear complaints of fuel mileage but coming from a full size I'm used to it. Currently averaging 17 around town but reached 24 on my last highway trip to Charlotte. ","160":"Maybe could be better on fuel. Off road the Pro4x is alright. Jeep wrangler is better. But for the most part not a bad truck","161":"The turning ratio on this truck is the pits! Cant believe Nissan did not do a better job takes at least two or more backups just to get in a parking place and backing up is just as bad.  We drove the truck before buying but did not realize this problem, Nissan again, I don't know>","162":"Great truck,  just be prepared to make frequently stops at your favorite gas station.  I can't seem to get more than 330 miles out of a tank.","163":"","164":"perfect truck and saves $10k compared to other trucks. fits everything needed. the bed is short but I got a bed extender to fit 15ft kayaks on. gas mi is lower than others, but it equals to my old 2000 CRV. 4X4 = A+! Folsom lake mud was an easy drive. no complaints! thanks nissan!","165":"This make's my 2nd Nissan Truck. Purchased New 7\/3\/13, so far so good.  A very nice Truck, with lot's of power.  So far I get 20.6MPG Averaged, in mixed driveing, which is about the same that I was getting with a '93 Nissan KC 4 cylinder AT 2WD that I had purchased New 20 year's before.   No problem's after 2 year's as only vehicle.  I looked at and drove them all.  Came down to Tacoma, Siverado, But Nissan Frontier came out on top,, with Most Truck for the Money.\n\nUPDATE @ 3 Years:   So far so good with no problem's.   One advice that I can give, is to not put these Truck's in Mud, Water, or Rough Off Roading.  I don't think these Truck's will stand up to that type of abuse.\nSo Far I'm Pleased with this 2013 SVV6 KC AT 2WD Nissan Truck.\n\nUpDate 1\/8\/17:  So far so good.  It's the Best Truck so far, that I've ever owned.  Just got a fillup and got 21mpg mixed driveing.  Plenty of power to pull my utility trailer.  Take's curve's better than the '93 Nissan Truck that I had previously.  Truck is so Tight,, that it took about 8K Mile's to start limbering up.  So Far no problem's, and so far, it is a very good truck for the money.  If you get one, Stay out of the Mud, Water and any Rough Off Roading like some Dumb Punk's do that abuse their Truck's and don't care if their Truck will last and be dependable.\n\nUpDate @ 4 Years 7\/9\/17:  So Far So Good.  Still the Best Truck so far that I've ever owned.  Am Averageing 20.4 MPG.  Steering was very tight in the beginning,, but limbering up nicely at almost 10 K Mile's.  Much better to be too tight than too loose.  Get you one now,, before this 2nd Generation Frontier is upgraded with a New Style Model, and enjoy saveing Money.  When the New Style Model come's out,, they'll have to pay for the New Style Cost's,, and they will cost you more.  Don't Put it in the Mud, Water, and Severe Offroading, Like Some Dumb Punk's do, if You Want Your Truck to Last and Be Dependable.  Remember this;  Marketing show's Severe Activitie's,, which a Pickup Truck is not intended for.  Remember those Commercial's showing Truck's Pulling Tree Stump's Out Of The Ground.  Don't be a Dumbo;  A Big 4 Wheel Drive Tractor can't even do that without first haveing to dig the Stump out with a Backhoe or Pushed over with a Bull Dozer before the Tree is Cut Off.  These are not Heavy Duty Truck's,, but if used according to the Owner's Manual, ie Transporting People, Cargo, and Pulling a Trailer within the Maximum Tow Rateing,, then I think that these Truck's will last a long time.  If you want the Paint to stay Nice and Shiney, use Meguiar's #6 Mirror Glaze Professional Cleaner\/Polish\/Wax Regularly.  Save Money and Get You One before the New Style Model come's out.","166":"Purchased new, currently at 16 months and 13,000 miles.  The size of the KC truck is ideal for my purposes; roomy enough to accommodate two people (good sized) with luggage inside.   Its dimensions are not too big to handle today\u0092s traffic and parking situations, but are large enough to provide a comfortable ride.   I wish it were quieter but will try to improve this area with future tire selection.   I prefer the Frontier\u0092s more upright chair-like seating position over the Tacoma (the only other truck I considered). ","167":"I bought this to tow our 3,500 lb Casita travel trailer.\nWe added a Leer Cap.\nWe have a 2013 crew cab SV with 4.0 2WD and 5-speed auto.\n The 265 HP is more than adequate and beats our old BMW X5 3.0 by at least 30 HP.\nSteering at highway speeds is vague and it wanders, but I noticed the tires are wearing on the inside and I believe the factory set the front-end with too much toe-out.\nThe headlight aim needs adjusting, too.\nThe sterro is OK, but the iPod starts by itself sometimes for no reason.\nWe added add-a-leaf springs to the back for towing, as it sagged a bit when loaded.\nOverall, it was about what I expected for a $25,000 vehicle.","168":"I chose the Frontier over the Tacoma, because the Frontier is 5% smaller but with a larger bed, and a larger engine with better economy.\nIt's also noticeably a few years fresher in design.\nI got the temporarily-discontinued PRO-4X with 6sp manual, which had to be shipped from Oregon to Nebraska.\nThe 6sp is a lot of fun, but the reverse gear is hard to find and should have been to the left like German autos.\nThe tailgate extender is nice because it's easy to remove.\nThe bed divider is functional but a bit obnoxious in that it's not an easy one-side affair to move or get out of the way.\nLove the step rails and tie anchors.\nThe ambient temperature sensor is occasionally disfuntional and I had an oil leak fixed in a gearbox plug.\nIt's economy is disappointing, but I think he'll last me until electric trucks come out.","169":"I had this truck for about 7 mths now.\nBought new. It is a rugged little truck.\nI say little even though it's consider as a mid size truck. On the out side it gives the illusion that it's has a roomer interior.\nNissan could have made it a few in wider and added a few in of leg room for back seat passengers. 1 week after having the truck I exp. a loud clanking noise during start ups, and while driving until the engine warmed up.\nThe dealer tried to tell me it was normal but turn out to be a loose cooling fan.\nNow my driver's side window makes scraping noise when the window is let up or down.\nLooks like I need a new regulator. Other than that it's a great truck, but with bad gas mileage.","170":"I owned a Tacoma TRD crew cab and while I enjoyed the truck, I didn't enjoy paying for it.\nA few years later, I find myself in the market for another vehicle, so I gave the 2014 Frontier SV 4x4 a try... and it's every bit as great as the Tacoma, minus the sticker shock.\nIt handles great, rides smooth as one can reasonably expect a 4x4 pickup to (takes potholes in Northern Virginia like a champ), has a lot of get-up-and-go, and the interior is even more comfortable than my Tacoma was.\nI'm looking forward to owning this truck for many, many years.\n\nUpdate:  I was sitting at a red light when a guy (in another Nissan Frontier, no less) rear ended me at 50+ mph without even hitting his brakes.  Needless to say, my Frontier didn't survive, but I got out of it with nothing more than a little whiplash and a mild concussion.  Up to that point, I was still really enjoying the truck and I can finally say that the safety, with regard to rear impacts, is pretty good.","171":"This replaced my 2000 4x2 Frontier (I got from a friend after he adopted 2 kids and needed a vehicle that could hold multiple car seats :-)\nThat truck ran great, good mileage, relatively low maintenance costs (except for the leaky fuel pump at 100k that cost $1100 to fix). \n\nAfter 800 miles, performance is very good (I'm not used to this much power), gas mileage as expected (4x4 not a winner there), comfort is good, interior features are generally good.\nOverall quite satisfied.","172":"This is my very first light weight truck and I will tell you I love the way it handles and I drive manual so the 6 speed if great, fast pick up in speed, great to take out on the trail. \nThis truck out shines all the GMC light weight and Chevys light weight is how well made it is nothing cheap on the Frontier.\nLooking very forward to many years with this truck.\nWell worth what I paid.","173":"So far I like it. Toyota 2wd sat low. Rear seats are better than Toyota too. Love the blue metallic exterior color. Too new and too early to review gas mileage. Think it will be fine. Does not seem to be thirsty. 3rd Nissan truck I've owned. First crew cab, with V6 5A. When I'm not driving my Nissan truck, I'm a driving a FedEx truck. My Nissan Frontier handles well at highway and interstates, no problems. ","174":"I just purchased my 4th Nissan Frontier. I traded in a Nissan D21 that I had for 25 years. My 2013 is a 4 cylinder, 5 speed, S model King Cab. It was priced about $3000 below a similar Toyota Tacoma.\nThe truck has crank windows, no power locks, and no Bluetooth. The first tank of gas I got almost 28 mpg in city and rural driving. On the second tank full I got 25 mpg. The secret is to shift around 2200 rpm. The truck is clunky and dated and simple transportation. For every 100 miles I drive this Frontier I save about $8 over the Tundra parked next to it in fuel costs.\nUPDATE: My real work truck developed a cab leak and filled with water. The passenger side of the cab was never sealed from the factory. I purchased a new 2015 Frontier SV 4x4 crew cab and traded in the 2013 as after the leak the smell never went away. MY ADVICE, before buying check carefully the seams of the cab to be sure they are fully factory sealed. UPDATE: The manual transmission in the end proved to be too much shifting in Seattle traffic. The 2013 Frontier was traded for a new (2015) Frontier SV CC with an automatic transmission. The mileage on the new Frontier isn't as good as the 2013 S model Frontier but in traffic, mostly sitting, the automatic is great. In retrospect, looking back on the 2013 purchase, I should have bought the 4 cyclinder S model Frontier with an automatic transmission. My mistake. UPDATE:\nThe 2015 Frontier SV went into the dealer for the  14000 mile service. One of the items was \"replace cabin filter\". After the cabin filter was replaced I asked to see the old filter. I was told it didn't have one installed from the factory. So in summary : truck one the, 2013 Frontier S, didn't have the cab sealed from the factory.;  truck two, 2015 Frontier SV, didn't have the cabin filter installed. It really makes me wonder about Nissan quality control.","175":"So far, truck is working out well. Minimal road noise for a pickup. Plenty of power. Steering tracks very good, especially at high speed. Seats firm and comfortable. Interior not well thought out. Too many cup holders that could have been used for storage compartments. Cheap plastic chrome exterior trim. 21+mpg mixed hwy\/city. Overall, good value when compared to competition with similar equipment. Fun to drive.","176":"This not the vehicle drive if windy  out, body material cheap sheet metal, paint fading and rub off at drivers  side door panel  Less than 1 year old and foam rubber seal around doors already splitting wide open, Haven't used radio since 4 months old speakers sound awful, affects Bluetooth as well can't understand caller Interior plastic or vinyl scraches too easy pernament scuffs marks just from work boots only 2 weeks old and notice blemishes on back plastic bed wall, although its not possible looks like sun damage,  Supension awful over loads is not cable of 5000 lb trailering like suggested in vehicle specifications, Leaf spring shackle 1\/2 inch bolt reduced to 1\/4 inch for nut broke resulting loss of both leaf springs within 4000 miles.

It's a keeper.","178":"I've only had this truck for a few weeks but it is exceeding my needs as expected. It came with a Snugtop shell and appeared to have light use.                                                                                               I chose this trim line over the Pro 4X because I wanted features but not the off road ride. At 53000mi it feels very tight.

I've only used the 4 wheel drive a little in the snow but switching was easy and it worked. Limited slip and abs was a new thing for me.                                                Although I have to duck when getting in the headroom is fine. The heated leather seats are firm but not hard with no sign  of wear. Center armrest is useless (to far back) but it's storage is ok and has a power port. Rear seat headrests do block vision some when looking back but heated mirrors work well too.                                                                                                                 Sprayed on bedliner is not as thick as LineX I had in another truck but is ok for light use. Tailgate liner is not sprayed on, is very slick and scuffs easily.","179":"This is my fourth Nissan Frontier truck. I bought the 2012 por4x and it was not a disappointment . I am going to be trading it in on a new 2016 shortly. The only thing that I don't care for is the gas mileage .I use premium Shell most of the time. I get around 15.5 mpg. But I have noticed that if I run a few highway miles on it ,it tends to get better mileage. It all depends how you treat the accelerator if mileage is in question.  . You don't have to \"floor it\" to pass or keep up with traffic  . The  v6 is sensitive in that it requires only moderate acceleration.  I suggest to anyone who owns one or is considering buying one that they check their tire pressure often as possible. You will get a more comfortable ride if you do.","180":"if you need a back seat to carry passengers do not buy the king cab version-- unless you are hauling small children. The king cab back seat is only good for gear ect--there is no leg room for adults. This trucks has very tight handling and a firm ride. The exhaust noise is louder than my old Mazda B4000  was but Frontier has a much more powerful V-6 and its more fun to drive.  Mine is fairly low option model but its well finished inside and out and everything continues to work perfectly. I wanted a Tacoma but basically the same optioned truck in a Toyota was 5-6 grand more-but with only a 4cyliner engine. Next time I might get the crew cab version to have useable back seats but for a weekend work truck the SV King cab does the job.  Mileage is about15- 16 in town and 17-19 on the highway--though I have gotten up to 20 hwy running higher octane fuel. The manual climate control systems work ok just a bit of getting use to. The traction control on this truck is wonderful. On snow covered roads with ice you can get by just fine without even engaging the 4WD.  The 4WD works just  well but this truck (with 150lb of weight in the back does) excellent except in much deeper snow or glare ice when you need the 4 wheel drive. The engine is a joy--smooth and powerful.","181":"I've owned trucks for thirty years.\nAs a professional salesman requiring a truck I drove Fords, Chevy's and even the pitiful Dodge.\nI prefer Toyota's, but for value you can't beat the frontier.\nIt was 5k cheaper than the comparably equipped Toyota Tacoma.\nThe tires that come on the Frontier are crap.\nThey lasted about 22k, and were outright scary on wet pavement.\nAfter putting Michelin ATX tires on the truck I feel it's among the best vehicles I've had.\nThrough the recent Ice storm in North Texas I never slid or had a problem getting where I wanted to go.","182":"I have the leather pro-4x model with every option available.\nThe off road system with locker is fantastic. Thing is very nimble off road.\nThe cargo system is the best from a factory that I have seen. It is very quite going down the highway. Is the right size living in the city and playing off road. I have taken my son and a friends kids all in car seats and have plenty of room in the back seat. Brakes and the motor feel very solid and have never let me down. On highway at 75-80 expect around 18-19.\nAround town Las Vegas is 15 mpg. Towing the max 6k weight will take you down to 7-9 mpg going though mtns.\nNo warrenty issues and just oil changes to date.

It has not let me down once, still performs great, and I could not be happier.  Gas mpg averages around 19 now which is ok for what this truck offers.  Sure, I'd like better mpg, but one cannot have everything.  Driving visibility is very good and I like the automatic locking systems w doors when I get moving.  As soon as I stop, the same system unlocks the doors.  AC works nicely and I don't really see any drop in mpg when I have AC on.  Honestly, I have yet to find anything I'd say is a minus.......way to go Nissan.","185":"impressions coming from 2004 frontier xe.\npower.\nstep on the gas like i did on the '04 and the tires would spin.\nhad to learn how to ease down a bit but i like that power. noise in the cabin is greatly reduced, i could actually hear the radio at low volume.\nthe ride is alot smoother as well.\n comfort level compared to the 04 makes me want to take a nap while driving if thats possible while the older one kept me awake for sure with the wind noise and bumpier ride.","186":" This truck is a nice size not as big as a Ford f150 that would not fit in my garage. Very comfortable seats. Takes road bumps pretty well for a truck. Wide turning radius.\n\n Power train is great 4x4 low take you up a 40 degree dirt road like you were on a flat surface.\n\n Nissan did cheap out with interior space and some trim. no roof seal molding and a glove box not big enough for owners manual???\n\n Averaging 18mpg. not bad for 4x4 v6.","187":"This truck has everything! I am coming from a 2003 Tacoma wich I love better than the new Frontier and the New Tacoma. The frontier has things that Toyota should be ashamed that they don't. Power seats, heated seats, heated mirrors. Rear Defroster! Who do they think is out in the weather, the little sedan or the 4X4 guys. This ommitance does not make sence. The ONLY problem with this truck is is wanders on the highway and even on back roads. You have to drive this truck and not take your eyes off the road. This truck is top SL version with 18'' tires. I have tryed removing some air from tires but still not perfect.","188":"I have only around 2k miles on the truck right now, but wanted to give my 2 cents on it. I looked at every other player on the market and it wasn't even close. On paper I thought the ridgeline would be the best until I drove it. You hit the gas and all you can hear is engine noise. The speed-o hardy would move. So the Tacoma. My last truck was a late 90's tacoma and just went on and on and on. So I thought for sure that would work. Nope. The seats are crap, and I got in the back seat and my head hit ceiling. I'm only 6'1. So that was out. So save yourself time and get Nissan. With rebates, fully loaded pro-x, leather ext 27k with rebates.\nBest out there. ","189":"I've put 8,000 miles on this truck so far, including hundreds on gravel and dirt through a Wyoming winter, and I have no regrets.\nNo warranty issues of any kind.\nThe V6 has plenty of power and the steering and handling are excellent on and off pavement.\n\nI considered the Tacoma since I like the looks slightly better, but Toyota has had some serious quality\/recall issues with the Tacoma over the last 10 years.\nThat, and the fact that toyata wants a few thousand more for an equally equipped truck leaned me toward Nissan. \n\nThe Frontier is indeed a rugged, no-nonsense truck.\nI expect to drive it for many years.\nBTW, JD Powers just ranked it the top midsize pickup for 2012.","190":"Wanted a truck to pull with occasionally and carry small loads.\nThe Sports Appearance Package is a big eye catcher and I have received lots of compliments on the wheels and overall looks.\nPulls great, lots of power for getting on and off highways, mileage is ok at 19.5 with a mix of city and highway, and bluetooth works great.\nBackseats are not for anything more than a small child, better to use the area for storage.\nHandles really well, steering feels good and tight and I love the locking tailgate.\nHeadlights and fog lights light the roads well and was very comfortable on an 8 hour road trip.","191":"My first choice was the tacoma but it was at least $7K more with the same option. I test drove both. I like the look of the tacoma better but the price was just way too high. I ended buying the frontier because I got it $4K less than the MSRP. Now with the frontier, the handling and power is great. I took it off road already and it handled it very well. MPG is about 15 on the city. I have not driven it on the highway that often to check the mpg. \nIf you are looking for a 4x4 truck, the pro-4x is the best deal under $30K out of the door. I shopped everywhere. I checked Rams, f150, tacoma, and all others. Price, reliability and handling are the main reasons I chose the frontier.","192":"I bought the 2012 Nissan Frontier Sport Appearance crew cab a month ago, and I love it! I couldn't stand the gas mileage in my 07 f-150 5.4L anymore, so I traded for the Frontier. I tow a fairly heavy 20 ft. flats boat, and I was nervous at first about towing with the V6 versus my big 5.4L. The Frontier does perfect! Pulling power is impressive, and the suspension actually feels better than the ford when loaded down. Gas mileage is impressive compared to the 12-15 I was getting, I drive a mixture of city\/ highway and right now I'm getting 19.4. I would definitely recommend this truck to anyone looking to get away from the MPG of a full-size truck without sacrificing ANY power.","193":"Bought show room virgin new, a black beauty SE. The head liner falls down 6 months old, now 2.5 yrs old, roof down for 3rd time. Honda Service tells me black vehicles do not do well in the south. The adhesive is not so good in the heat. Tell me my new truck is the only Honda ever to have the head liner fall down repeatedly. they now say someone is pulling it down. I have no children, dog... I am the only one that uses the truck for a short commute to & fro work. Its a sport vehicle, never used as a truck. no one has ever been in the back seat. Beware, Honda says way too hot for Black in the south. Your roof will fall down. I am an automotive engineering professional, disappointed in the Honda service incompetence.... no fix and its still under warranty (WTF?). I will never purchase a Honda again after 9 Hondas. This is Hondas service attitude (Columbia South Carolina).","194":"I have had the Honda ridgeline RTS for three years. I have a dog and allergies. The bed of the truck really helps me when I am traveling with my dog. It also helps when I just need to transport something small like a chair or table. I love the hidden trunk space and the valet key! I am a female and ALL of my friends just love this truck. I think that maybe your marketing was aimed at the wrong audience. I really, really think that you guys may have mis-marketed this truck! I expected to lease or buy a Honda ridgeline forever . . . but now I am considering the Jeep wrangles. I do not want a traditional man's truck. I look at your 2017 Honda ridgeline and just feel so bad. It is not even a semblance of it's original great self. Won't you reconsider? I saw one truck (someone else driving it); looked and looked for another one in my town, and months later saw another one. I was hooked! Since I have bought my truck, I now see them quite frequently!","195":"My dealer hounds me about getting the transmission fluid changed for a whopping $167. I've never had a vehicle in which this was even suggested by a dealer. The owner's manual says there are indicator lights to show what is needed. I've never seen any indicator to suggest changing any fluid other than engine oil. It may just be that my dealer is trying to scam me.","196":"I love my Ridgeline!  After two years and with 30,000 miles, I am still just as happy with it as when it was brand new!","197":"Bought new and have owned the Ridgeline-Sp Edition for almost two years(approx. 22,000 mi). Have never contacted Honda dealer or any service dept since truck was driven home in March of 2014, and have never had an issue, mechanical or cosmetic. Synthetic oil changes and an air filter by nearby lube place only. I'd never before owned or driven a Honda or Acura vehicle. This truck\/SUV has very good acceleration & handling characteristics(I suppose much like the Honda Pilot on which it's based). Sound system is good,  Heat\/AC very good, storage areas up front & center console very good.  Front seat comfort is outstanding from the seats themselves to their position relative to the steering wheel and height to the windows & visibility outside the truck.  Never ridden in the backseat but haven't heard any complaints and rear seat legroom & overall space is large. The rear seats are split 60-40 & fold-up to form a cavernous storage area(friends new Chevy truck also does this now---in a likely copy of the Honda).   Waterproof & locking trunk under bed is fantastic,  almost as large as a typical auto trunk.  Update  2-4-17:  drivers side rear power window moving very slowly, may need motor replacement and passenger side rear window making a loud grinding noise on descent. Rear brake taillight burned out and easily user replaced.  Adjusting overall fuel mileage down to 18(from est 19 earlier) Michelin tires still good tread  @  36,000 miles and overall still very pleased with vehicle.","198":"I've had my Ridgeline for about 18 months now.\nI had one very minor warranty claim, which was handled promptly and courteously by the dealer.\nThis is a great vehicle for the suburbanite who needs to make the occasional Home Depot run, and may need to haul a smaller RV trailer.\nI've hauled U-Haul's 6 x 12 trailer fully loaded with no trouble using the factory installed receiver.\n This is NOT for the manly man who needs a macho truck.\nIt's a great combination of comfort and flexible cargo capacity.\nThe trunk in the bed makes a great cooler for tailgating.\n\nI have now owned my Ridgeline for three years.  It remains a very reliable, serviceable vehicle.  It's perfect for my needs.  The technology in the vehicle was out of date when it came off the production line, but I'm not the kind of guy who needs all the bells and whistles.  In fact, I really don't want to pay for them.  The headlights don't come on automatically, and the controls for the ventilation system are--to be kind--awkward.","199":"I chose Honda because of their reliability and reputation of building quality vehicles.\nIt is a decision that I have grown to regret.\nThe idea of the Ridgeline is great.\nIt has plenty of storage and is rather roomy in the front and rear seats.\nI am 6' 2\" and I am quite comfortable.\nThe engine is smooth but the transmission has issues shifting when it's cold.\nMy issue is with the fit and finish and how Honda has handled the warranty issues with my vehicle.\nNot one of the doors line up on my Ridgeline.\nOther Ridgelines have this same issue where the doors aren't flush with the surrounding body panels.\nMine leaked water as a result and it has yet to be fixed correctly.","200":"I have had my Ridgeline for about 2 months now and I couldn't be happier with it. It really fits the bill for me and what I was looking for. The Ridgeline may not be the best truck for everyone but for what 95% of truck buyers actually need a pickup for the Ridgeline goes above and beyond. It comfortable, quiet, roomy, well built, and above all versatile. There's nothing else on the market that is so well rounded. I needed a pickup for the occasional run to the home improvement store, hauling furniture, and big bulky items. The Honda is made just for such tasks. I also fish, camp, and canoe so the ample storage options and available roof rack really make those activities a breeze. ","201":"I bought this vehicle because of the large amount of storage and cubbies, and smooth test drive. I'm happy to say that's what the purchased vehicle delivers. Unfortunately, it falls short in nearly every other area. ","202":"This is the first review that I have ever written for a product but I could not resist because the Ridgeline is such an excellent vehicle.    I purchased the Ridgeline used about one year ago with only 13K miles and have driven it for 15K miles.  It is the first pick-up that I have owned and love it.  Prior to purchasing, I did plenty of research and test drove the old and new 2017 model.  In my opinion, the new 2017 model is just OK.  My personal preference is the old design.  Things like most:  car-like ride; comfort; tons of interior storage capacity and compartments; in-bed trunk (holds two sets of golf clubs); the mid-size makes it easy to maneuver (my wife has no problem driving it); traction in the snow; easy-to-use controls (knobs and buttons vs the new touch screen); gate swings to the side (very convenient).   Things where improvement could be made:  has no memory seat; poor radio reception; the \"on\" \/ \"off\"  indicator for air conditioning setting is small and difficult to read; poor compass.  Extra accessories:  bed cover (keeps things dry and improves gas mileage); rubber bed mat for protection; cargo net (works great for holding cargo in place).       We have owned several Honda's.  They are very dependable.  Would highly recommend the Ridgeline.","203":"I have only had the vehicle a short time, but I love it. This is my first Honda.","204":"I highly recommend getting  a bed cover.  It will help with the mileage.  That is pretty much the only thing about the vehicle that I wish was better.  I love all the storage.  You give up some getting a four door short bed, but the truck (under the bed) is huge.  I was able to put a table saw in it with plenty of room.  The fold up rear seats are great too.","205":"I love my truck.  I purchased it new and put 50,000 miles in the first three years and it was a great commuter over highways and hilly back roads.  We both retired in 2016, and it great for picking up garden supplies and transporting our bikes and kayak.   Although, I did have to buy a bed extender to hook up to the trailer hitch for the kayak.  The only thing two comments is that I am hesitant to take it on the beach with the computer control traction.   I've read about the problems in soft sand.  I understand the problem has been solved on the 2017 model.  But, it's a real beast in the snow.  You can take off from a dead stop with traction control and not slip and slid and stopping is no problem at all.  The other problem is the radio reception, poor.   Oh yes, one last comment.  I never encountered this problem, but have always been concerned.  What if you have the truck bed loaded up and you get a flat.  The spare is in the trunk under the bed.    That said, it is a great vehicle.","206":"I BOUGHT A 2013","207":"I wanted an all around vehicle with a comfortable on the road ride with some off the road capability.  A vehicle that would be able to handle a snow storm or icy roads.  A vehicle I could haul bags of mulch, or shrubs from the nursery.  A vehicle that could carry the grandkids, cooler, buggy boards, umbrella and chairs to the beach.  And I got it with my 2013 Honda Ridgeline I purchased new.  A great vehicle.","208":"Just like the knife, it isn't necessarily the best when compared to more targeted, specialized tools, but you love it because it does so many things well.\n\nA very competent daily drive that goes to work with you on the weekends.","209":"I just bought a 2013 ridgeline truck with the nav system. The truck is fine except for the radio. Anytime I am around a telephone pole I lose reception. It has been at the dealers for a week now and they have replaced the antenna cable, amplifier, and antenna. I still lose all reception. On one of the road trials they hooked up a temporary outside antenna and the reception was great. But Honda told them to replace the parts. \nI realize that the truck looks good without the antenna sticking out of the roof but it seems there is a problem with it. \n","210":"I had a Ford F-150 FX-4 for the past 10 years.\nIt was reliable and a great truck, but the gas mileage sucked and i wasn't using it as a large truck should be used very often.\nWhen I did it always filled the bill, though sucking up a gallon og gas every 10 miles got old.\nIt was also cumbersome to drive & park in traffic.\nThe Ridgeline is a well-built, more compact truck that more suits the way I drive these days.\nIt will pull a trailer and get me through the snow, just not as heavy a trailer or as deep a snow as the Ford.\nThe Ford was a super cab with a small back seat.\nThe Honda is crew cab with a roomy back seat.\nIt gets 21 mpg at 70 mph and 20 mpg at 75 mph. \n","211":"I'm very happy with my Honda Ridgeline purchase. ","212":"I drove a Ford F150 Lariat for 15 years. When it came time to replace that truck I wanted to downsize a little.\nI drove all of the smaller pickups in the market and found the Honda Ridgeline to be the right size, 4 wheel capability, smooth riding, relatively quiet, and fully capable for what I need in a pickup. Getting the Honda reliability was a plus. We drove it around town for the first 4K miles and it was a pleasure driving it in an urban setting, easy to park, great for those occasional trips to buy furniture, and good looking enough for date nights. You guessed it, I don't miss my F-150.  50000 + miles later and my Ridgeline is still driving like new. Have only done the scheduled maintenance including regular oil changes and new transmission oil. The tires are still great, the truck runs straight, nothing leaks, and I still love driving it each day. \n    Since I have purchased this vehicle a new designed model is about to be launched and I'm anxious to see it up close. I have grown accustomed to the ugly original look, and even though I think Honda missed the mark on a NEW design, it's still a Honda and it will always run better than it looks.\n     \n     The new 2017 Honda Ridgeline has come out now and Honda was able to give us something new and take away something at the same time.  They gave us a truck that resembles most other trucks on the market, they kept what works from the original Ridgeline, and added some new things to pay for.  It's not cool to have to pay for features once standard equipment, ie AWD and electric rear window.  The new Ridgeline is nice, but now since I have taken 3 years to get to like my Ridgeline, I like the old style just a little better.  Honda fell short on knocking my socks off with its new design, new colors, and new features.  The one thing Honda never falls short on is quality and the fact that Hondas just work and work well. I will eventually own a new Ridgeline, why not, they are a great vehicle, but my 2013 Ridgeline is still a great truck.  It runs well, looks good, drives the best, quiet, and reliable. It's a Honda.\n     Well I've owned a driven my Ridgeline for about 67K miles and 4 years. Tires just got replaced, but everything else is still working great. Regular oil changes and filter changes is all I've done. This vehicle is not babied, we drive it hard and loaded on the highway, it spends several hours a day on gravel mountain roads and it sits out in the elements when it's parked in Florida. \n     I'm still not in love with its original styling and yet to feel the same about the new 2017 design, but I love how my Ridgeline just works quietly for me. I'll eventually buy a new one, but hope more design changes as well as better colors will be offered. Let's face it, the Ridgeline is an urban pickup. Make it look smart and give it great colors. The 2017 model is a weak start, keep up with greater design modifications.","213":"Pretty much as expected.\nGreat interior design, although it is missing the iPod\/USB connection and Bluetooth.\nTrunk in bed is awesome feature.\nGas mileage is averaging just over 19","214":"Great truck.  reliable, great storage, dependable easy to maintain.","215":"Really like the idea of having a vehicle with a bed but on independent suppension and a unibody. Good ride and solid.","216":"I purchased this truck about a year ago with 100k miles and I've driven it as a daily commuter. I replaced an old Dodge V8 truck, which I loved, and although I sometimes miss that rowdy V8 exhaust rumble and the engine torque, that truck doesn't at all compare to this one. The Ridgeline has performed fantastic in the snow, mud, and rain. It has a ride that's very comfortable and a powertrain that suits the vehicle. It sits high enough to feel like a proper truck and it has been very durable. My buddies at work make fun of me but they appreciate the truck's functionality. Recently I had to drive a couple of days in freezing snow and I never felt the truck lose traction. I would buy this truck again.","217":"Very disappointed is  several areas.\nThere is always something breaking.  \n-After 2 years the third brake light assembly broke off the truck on the highway.  It was out of warranty.  Honda USA was no help even though it is a pretty well documented problem on forums.  Quote from the dealer $800.  Radio never worked well, but found out the antenna was located in the third brake light assembly.  \n- brakes are paper.  I do highway driving.  3 sets of brakes in 3 years.  I know it's operator influenced, but I've never had this in any other vehicle.\n- left front axle blew out after 3 years.\n- timing belt on a truck?  really.  My bad for not researching more thoroughly.  $900 along with spark plugs and valve adjustment due at the same time for an additional $600.\n- virtually every oil change at is accompanied by either differential, transmission, or coolant change.  Why are other vehicles rated for 60-100K between fluid changes?\n\nSeats are very rigid and uncomfortable for moderate to long rides.  The interior design is perplexing.  Why put the Aux cord input in the dash on the passenger side?  Also, the space below the middle console is wasted space.  You can't get to it without having everything from the top space fall into it. Interior seat material scratches very easily.  \n\nWould not recommend this truck.  I'm sure the value is going to drop through the floor once they introduce the new model.","218":"I traded a 2006 Ridgeline on a 2010 CRV to downsize and save fuel. That will be my last 4 cylinder in a SUV. The tweaks from 2006 to 2012 are noticable. It's quieter and peppier. I took six months to purchase a vehicle, test driving many SUV vehicles. The CX-9 was a top contender. But, at 6-02, it lacked enough headroom. Do not compare the Ridgeline to heavy duty pickups. That not what it is. I use it for hiking, camping, biking, trips to Lowes....etc. If I could describe it, using only one word, it would be smooth. I hope Honda does not kill the Ridgeline but updates it.","219":"My only complaint is that the two cupholders are awkward to reach from the driver's seat. Aside from that rather trivial matter, this is an excellent rig.","220":"This is my 3rd truck and it's the best yet ! My only complaint is no CD player","221":"I had this pick up back to the dealership Jim Curley GMC 6 times and they still tell me that the transmission problems I've been having are normal. I'm so tired of hearing that.","222":"The vehicle looks nice all around. It doesn't seat well for tall people - I'm 6'4\". I've adjusted the seating and still have issues. The top of the seat pushes my upper back forward and causes me to slouch forward after prolonged sitting (greater than 20 minutes); this causes neck pain. Also, there have been 5 (maybe 6) recalls on the vehicle since I bought it in February of 2015. I'm thinking about selling it and getting a truck that doesn't have so many issues with better seats.\n\nUpdate 05\/16\/17: The truck had more than 8 paint chips around the entire body. After doing some research I learned that GM vehicles (GMC, Chevy, Buick, etc.) have a history of paint chipping issues. Apparently, the primer GM uses is the problem. Regardless, my truck was still under the bumper to bumper warranty and it would have been a prolonged source of frustration and anxiety to get it taken care of to my (the customer) liking. GM only had one representative for my entire state (Maryland) so my situation worse. In December of 2016, I ended up trading in my truck for an F150: I took a hit financially but it was worth it. I won't buy another GM manufactured vehicle again and I will warn the people I know who are considering buying one about paint chipping issues.","223":"Great looking truck but the drive train is AWFUL.  The transmission shifts up too quickly and then stays there.  If you slow and try to accelerate, it lugs because it is in the wrong gear.  GM calls it \"normal operation\"  I call it poor engineering.  It upsets me every time I see those \"Professional Grade\" commercials because I know that they are BS.  I filed a lemon law claim in my state and GM wouldn't accept responsibility for the truck's performance.  Not worth pursuing on my part.    I drove a demo at the dealer and it was exactly the same.  That's ok GM.  I wonder how many Tacomas this review is going to sell.","224":"We have compared all mid size trucks, Frontier, Tacoma, Ridgeline. Frontier is good value, but out dated design and fuel economy. Don't like the ride of Tacoma, and Ridgeline is too new and sell at MSRP. Finally picked the Canyon, which has best ride and interior modern design, we got Crew Cab, SLE with All Terrain and Bose\/NAV\/Comfort pkgs. Bought it from Laura Buick GMC before labor day holiday with >7k discount, excellent value! After >200 miles, ~23 mpg highway and 17-18 local, about the advertised mpg. We wish it is easier to get in and out, may consider a running board.","225":"Beware of GM.  This vehicle is OK,. but the dealer and manufacturer support is terrible.  I will not purchase another GM product for quite some time if ever again.  Transmission is very sluggish.  Location of drive selector (2W,4W) is bad. Easy to hit with your knees unless your 4 ft. tall.  Muffler sounds like a Toro with a hole in it, but dealer says this is normal.  I compared the 2016 Tacoma and 2016 Canyon closely and decided that for my purposes, the Canyon was more comfortable (driver head room and leg room) and used that as my main criteria.   On the highway the Canyon is pretty responsive and handles fairly well, but the  mileage is substantially lower than stated.   My biggest issue is the poor dealer support I got when I had to replace a rear center side glass.  Some bonehead tried to break in the truck through the rear slide glass (I guess?... there were no rocks, meteorites, or dead birds present when I returned from grocery shopping, but the center glass was totally knocked out). The response I got was that GM showed the part with a price, but they could not tell me if it was available or not.  All third party glass companies said it was only a dealer part.  After a week of waiting on the dealer (Ferguson GMC-Tulsa), they still could not tell me when or whether the part would be available.   GM needs to have their OEM vendors produce and stock replacement equipment for their vehicles for at least a few years, or until third parties can produce.  I cannot get the part from GM or anyone after 7 days.  My only options are to replace the entire for $900+ or put a cheap (non defrost solid piece of glass into it).  GM SUCKS and I will go back to Jap and German vehicles as much as possible. I currently own 6 vehicles between personal and business and business.  You would think that American manufacturers learned their lessons in the 70-80's from Japan, but maybe they just need to be govt. subsidized in order to function at the level of Toyota, Lexus, Audi, Mazda, etc.    No mention of \"bulletins\" by dealer when I purchased it.  The transmissions are going to be a big problem in this vehicle... beware.  GM will do everything in their power to hide and diffuse the issue... maybe like they did with the 124 deaths related to faulty  ignition switches that they knew about and covered up.","226":"I bought my 2015 GMC Canyon, ext cab WT in Nov \u201915 with only 600 miles on the clock.  Even though it is the WT version it\u2019s the upgraded version with power windows, locks, remote, air and the V6 complete with the tow package capable of towing 7,000 lbs.  The 2nd Gen truck looks awesome and great looking inside and out but that\u2019s where it ends.  I\u2019ll admit that the engine is very powerful but the transmission and computer is the weakest link.  It\u2019s not a pleasure to drive.  Example:  driving on the highway, anything between 55 up to 70 and then needing to slow down and then pick back up on speed it starts to chug and surge like it\u2019s struggling for the gear or running out of gas.  It does the same thing when trying to climb a hill or going around a corner.   I\u2019ve had it into the dealership twice, had the computer upgraded and talked with them several times on the phone but they still don\u2019t have a fix.  I would have gladly exchange the 22+ MPG for 17 or 18 MPG to have it shift right.   I would not recommend this truck.  As of today of writing this, it only has 10,000 miles on it and I\u2019m still not happy so I\u2019m trading it in for a Jeep G.C.  This was my first GMC and I was very disappointed and will never get another GMC again.","227":"Front seats uncomfortable. Very little padding.","228":"I've owned this truck for 6 months and I am very happy with my purchase. I use it as my daily driver because it's comfortable, quiet, has decent gas mileage (21mpg), and also has power when I need it. The exterior looks great and the inside has more than enough room for my wife and 2 kids. I've had no major issues with the truck. So far SO good!\n\nUpdate: 11\/15\/16... So far SO good!","229":"Lot's to like about this truck.  Comfortable and quiet overall.  It has got a lot of towing power and payload capacity with great gas mileage.  More city driving than highway but overall 20.7 mpg on regular gas.  Good acceleration.  Really like the backup camera.\n\nThe interior does have a lot of hard plastic so change tends to rattle.  The seats feel good and firm on long trips and the road and wind noise level is very good (quiet).  The problem is that the steering wheel rattles and the dealer has been instructed not to fix it.  This is a problem with both the Canyon and Colorado models and is noted in the GMC technical Document ID: 4089969 dated in February 2015 .  Very annoying with the quiet interior. Other small interior problems were fixed by the dealer but this one instructs them to wait until GMC defines a fix.  A bad mark on an otherwise nice truck.","230":"I had been waiting for 6 months to see this truck. I had a 2007 Chevy Colorado and I hated it. But with all the hype I needed to see the new Canyon before I committed to any other truck and I am so glad I did. It is the most comfortable truck that I have ever driven. It is easy to maneuver and it does everything that I would expect out of a luxury truck ( and I do not even have all the bells and whistles. ) I took it on a long trip and there was never a time that I was uncomfortable. I love this truck and hope they only get better although I do not how it could.","231":"... to the mid size truck market. Have had my 2015 Canyon 4 x 4 SLT about 2 months now.  Have used it mostly for city driving other than a 1500 mile trip to Northern CA and Northern NV.  Averaged 23.9 during the trip and averaging 20.2 overall.  Very comfortable for long trips, smooth ride for a 4 x 4.  Controls user friendly, and thank you GM for making a nav system that can be used by a passenger while driving.  My RAM 3500 and Jeep GC had nav systems that were unable to use during vehicle movement.  Great looking truck and no issues thus far.","232":"I still love my Canyon !  My gas mileage is better that I expected over all.  I get average of 21 city with road trip mileage around 26.  Biggest problem seems to be the electronics.  I had a major component failure that resulted in zero control of heating or AC.  Heat was fully on crossing the Mojave desert with 105 out side temps.  Dealer kept truck for three days waiting on parts from GM.  Now I see a major recall for same problem nationally.  I am about ready to take in for another replacement of shifting control switch in shifter.  No manual control any more. Driver window control also acting up and will have it checked.  Think it is the switch.","233":"This truck exceeded my expectations.  I was unsure about going from a full-size to a mid-size truck and after driving this truck for a few days I will never go back!  The V-6 gives you plenty of power and the transmission has crisp shifts.  I have the All-Terrain off-road package which has a surprisingly smooth composed ride.  The steering is precise and and handling is top notch!  Best of all parking is a breeze!!!  \r\n\r\nThe interior materials give a sense of quality and the cabin is well insulated from road noise.  GM did their homework when they designed this truck!  \r\n\r\nLet's face it size does matter and the 2015 Canyon is the right size at the right time! ","234":"Switched from a full sized Silverado with no regrets. Although I have only driven it 400 miles, I know it was the right choice. It is comfortable, quiet, and reasonably appointed.The box is a bit narrower (about 6in), but with the 6.2 ft box, you can still haul quite a bit of stuff. \n\nThe V-6 is strong, but a bit loud when pushed.  I got just over 25mpg on the my first extended highway trip driving at speeds of 70-78mph which was quite impressive for me.\n \nThe pricing is also quite competitive, and you can get a very well equipped truck around 30K, my sweet spot. \n\nI will update once I get more miles on the truck if my opinion changes as I get more miles on it.\n\n02\/01\/17 - After 42,000 miles on my Canyon, I am still in love with it, it has proven to be a great truck and I plan to drive it at least another 40,000 miles before trading it off.","235":"I have owned multiple Tacomas, Frontiers and Ridgelines.  I like the midsize truck.  I decided on the Canyon mainly for improved driving comfort on long trips as well as gas mileage.  I have 2,628 miles and my lifetime MPG is 22.  That is impressive.  The best highway mileage on any of the above trucks was 22.  I am getting 22 in mixed driving and have gotten over 25 on the highway.  The build quality is solid and I love the 6' 2\" bed.  The truck is as long as a full size pickup but 6\" narrower which makes all the difference in the world when parking.  If you compare it to the 80's and 90's trucks it is just as big but 100% better.  It does everything I need and nothing I don't.","236":"After much research, I decided on the GMC Canyon over a full size pickup.\r\n\r\nWith 1500+ miles on the Canyon, this is my take on the truck.\r\n\r\nRIDE, a truck like ride that is smooth, firm and quite. HANDLING, confident and comfortable but a bit heavy at times.  ENGINE, strong V6, fuel efficient. TRANSMISSION, shifts smoothly and for the most part predicable. On strong acceleration or downshifting the transmission can have a hard shift at times. FUEL ECONOMY, first two tanks over 22.5 MPG (70% Highway) This is a little better than I expected. BUILD QUALITY, very good fit and finish and build quality over all. VALUE, good, the Chevy Colorado would be a better choice for some concerning value.\r\n","237":"It has its \"act together.\"","238":"Never figgered out why other companies build auto transmissions that CANNOT allow people to tow the vehicle with all four wheels down.\n\nAnd Edminds NEVER mentions it as a HUGE advantage of GM vehicles.\n\nThere are a BUNCH or RV'ers out there who buy Canyon and Colorado SOLEY due to this characteristic.\n\nOtherwise, it is a small pickup.\nWhat do you expect ?\n\nSince the S-10 got dumped, it's the only game in town."},"thumbsUpDownCounter":{"1":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"2":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"3":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"4":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"5":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":11},"6":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":6},"7":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":6},"8":{"thumbsDown":5,"thumbsUp":5},"9":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":8},"10":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":11},"11":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":8},"12":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"13":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":22},"14":{"thumbsDown":21,"thumbsUp":14},"15":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":18},"16":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":16},"17":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":14},"18":{"thumbsDown":5,"thumbsUp":8},"19":{"thumbsDown":5,"thumbsUp":13},"20":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":9},"21":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"22":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"23":{"thumbsDown":5,"thumbsUp":5},"24":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":9},"25":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"26":{"thumbsDown":121,"thumbsUp":11},"27":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"28":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"29":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"30":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"31":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"32":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"33":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"34":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"35":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"36":{"thumbsDown":6,"thumbsUp":1},"37":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"38":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"39":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"40":{"thumbsDown":6,"thumbsUp":5},"41":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":9},"42":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":5},"43":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":3},"44":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":7},"45":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":6},"46":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"47":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"48":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":30},"49":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":9},"50":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":18},"51":{"thumbsDown":47,"thumbsUp":3},"52":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":13},"53":{"thumbsDown":10,"thumbsUp":15},"54":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":24},"55":{"thumbsDown":6,"thumbsUp":24},"56":{"thumbsDown":88,"thumbsUp":182755},"57":{"thumbsDown":10,"thumbsUp":78},"58":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"59":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"60":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"61":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":2},"62":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"63":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":2},"64":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":5},"65":{"thumbsDown":5,"thumbsUp":17},"66":{"thumbsDown":12,"thumbsUp":6},"67":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":1},"68":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":10},"69":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":16},"70":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":3},"71":{"thumbsDown":26,"thumbsUp":39},"72":{"thumbsDown":44,"thumbsUp":71},"73":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":59},"74":{"thumbsDown":108,"thumbsUp":36},"75":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":1},"76":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":6},"77":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":2},"78":{"thumbsDown":6,"thumbsUp":10},"79":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":6},"80":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":19},"81":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":22},"82":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":3},"83":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":15},"84":{"thumbsDown":33,"thumbsUp":40},"85":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"86":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"87":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"88":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":0},"89":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":10},"90":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"91":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":5},"92":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":11},"93":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":8},"94":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":5},"95":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":3},"96":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":3},"97":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"98":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"99":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":1},"100":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"101":{"thumbsDown":6,"thumbsUp":8},"102":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":8},"103":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"104":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":10},"105":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":4},"106":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":18},"107":{"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":6},"108":{"thumbsDown":5,"thumbsUp":7},"109":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":7},"110":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":17},"111":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":4},"112":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":20},"113":{"thumbsDown":2,"thumbsUp":8},"114":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":11},"115":{"thumbsDown":11,"thumbsUp":18},"116":{"thumbsDown":17,"thumbsUp":24},"117":{"thumbsDown":9,"thumbsUp":18},"118":{"thumbsDown":7,"thumbsUp":21},"119":{"thumbsDown":8,"thumbsUp":14},"120":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":11},"121":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":44},"122":{"thumbsDown":7,"thumbsUp":26},"123":{"thumbsDown":11,"thumbsUp":17},"124":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":13},"125":{"thumbsDown":11,"thumbsUp":14},"126":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"127":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"128":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"129":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"130":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"131":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0},"132":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":1},"133":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":1},"134":{"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":2},"135":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":1},"136":{"thumbsDown":18,"thumbsUp":1},"137":{"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":4},"138":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":5},"139":{"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":1},"140
