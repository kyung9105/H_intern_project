Mid-Size Truck Market is very interesting and great if you are interested in buying a new Vehicle, that is a little bit bigger than your Typical SUV, but can still handle the load and look aesthetically pleasing. I am a Civil Engineer and I travel to a lot of different Construction Sites. I used to own a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee (8 Cyl - 4WD), but it had A LOT of issues. The cost to repair its major flaws almost equated to the same amount I put down toward my lease for a new 2017 Toyota Tacoma Off-Road (Highest Premium Technology Package). To be honest the Toyota Tacoma never interested me because I wanted to stay with American Cars... After visiting the Philadelphia Car Show one weekend, I was looking forward to purchasing a GMC Canyon Denali or a Chevy Colorado. Though the Full Size Trucks looked great (Ford F-150, Ram Rebel, etc.) they were just a bit too large even for a person of my size (6'-2\"\/250lbs). However, after facing dealership issues trying find the GMC Canyon Denali, I decided to visit a well-reviewed Toyota Dealer to see the Toyota Tacoma, and my view point changed completely. The Tacoma Off-Road Package had (4) Doors, so I can still have my co-workers, family, and friends get into the vehicle. \nThe Toyota Tacoma off-Road came with all the Technology Features (Navigation, Bluetooth, EnTune Radio, Wireless Charging Pad, Push-to-Start), Sun-Roof, and it also had Toyota's Safety features (Blind Spot mirrors, Rear-Collision Detect, Stop-Sensors, etc). In addition, compared to the other mid-size truck companies Toyota actually came with a lot of accessories that the others would force you to buy separately. Even with all the good new features there are some flaws, like the manual seat adjustments, weird placement of steering wheel, and sometimes sluggish acceleration. But even with that I still love this truck. I do a lot of volunteer work with my church, and I can haul equipment just fine, and the Short Box, which I preferred allows me to still park in Normal Parking Conditions. Plus the look of the Truck is 'Manly' and Aggressive so you get people to move out the way when you come donw the road, or turn heads when you drive by.  Sometimes I feel like the best part of my day is when I wake up to drive and come home from work because the Truck is that enjoyable. If you previously owned poor vehicles of any kind you will greatly appreciate this one no matter what. In addition, I decided to lease my Tacoma because to own the car was a bit more expensive and if they upgrade the car in the future I can move on that vehicle instead. \nToyota Tacoma supposedly has a good resale value because the Trucks are tough. I do not go Off-Roading, and I predominantly drive on the Highways of NJ. I usually like to cruise and enjoy my rides, so I do not keep up too well with my fellow fast pace drivers. But my MPG is 17cty, and 21.5hwy and when I get to the job site the conditions out there are far different than the normal road. But even then, rocks, curbs, or big logs cannot hinder this Truck from Moving. A Crawl Control Feature is included if you really like going Off-Road. Overall, If you are still judging between which mid-size truck to purchase I highly recommend you look at this Toyota Tacoma and take it for a Test-Drive. [Lease Info: $375\/mth; 3yr \u2013 12,000mi]","2":"Rear differential failed at 750 miles. Replacement recalled for leaks 3 months later. Harsh ride compared to other trim levels, combination of hard leather seats and dated leaf spring supension creates fatigue on long rides. Steering wheel adjustment is a joke. Acceleration is disappointing when operating in Atkinson cycle but floor it and Otto cycle is great. Have not tried E85 fuel.  Six speed transmission shifts up early but sufficient torque is available when pulling 3,000 lb. loaded trailer.  4 x4 Hi drive with traction control is good on ice. 4 x 4 Lo will climb through 3 ft. snow banks. The power moon roof and power rear window is perfectly matched and provides excellent ventilation at any speed.","3":"Shifting is clunky at times even after recalls were performed at 10,000 mile check up. At same service the technician found a front differential noise that led to a 2 1\/2 week loaner and a new from differential. Never even had it in 4 wheel drive. Makes me nervous about it now that I had a lift added at the same service date because they made a comment that reflected no noise and lift was installed. Why even comment on the lift? It had nothing to do with the differential needing replaced.","4":"I bought a new TRD Sport 6 cylinder 4X2. It's perfect for where I live. Houston has cracked up roads and potholes everywhere. Since getting this model I have been spending less on  gas than my Honda Accord four banger that was a 2012 model. If you drive without getting down and punching it the gas mileage is great. In Houston you drive light to light or sit on the freeway. It's nice to have the power though when there is a slow poke to get around or someone being an ass. I'm like the truck very much!","5":"On my second day of ownership I noticed a howling\/whining sound between  50-60 mph and a gas pedal vibration that was quite irritating.  The dealer found metal shavings in the rear differential and  replaced the rear differential on my brand new truck.  The howling noise improved, but is still present.  At times I can hear it over the radio.  The gas pedal vibration improved, but I am still not happy.  I took it back to dealership again.  There's nothing the dealership can do further without Toyota's permission.  I have a case opened with Toyota.  We'll see what happens.  The dealership had me test drive their other SR5 double cab long beds and they all sound worse than my truck.  So this dealer has a lot full of trucks with bad rear differentials for sale.  I have serious concerns about this truck and don't have any faith in Toyota.  So much for reliability.","6":"My worst purchase in my life, much below my expectations . It requires very high RPM, sometimes it goes above 5. It often it in pain, labor pain without epidural . I bought 2015 Tacoma v4, weak, so I traded it on for v6, all wheel drive, limited. Not huge difference in performance from his brother v4. Will sell it","7":"I've only put 1,000 miles on this truck, but so far its been great. You may get a more comfortable car like ride with a Canyon or Colorado but these two trucks lack the truck feel that I wanted. The TRD Off-road is awesome looking and is a real head turner. We took my wife's Mazda in for service and the whole service department was staring out the window at it in awe. I feel like I can tackle any terrain in this truck and the double cab with a 6 foot bed it actually looks like a practical balanced vehicle compared to the 5 ft bed. The only read complaint I have is the transmission. It does seem to lean towards low rpm which can make it feel sluggish at times but the manual mode and the ECT power button overcome this issue.","8":"Overall great truck. Not the fastest acceleration, but ok for me. Very solid ride, but comfortable.  Would recommend.","9":"I purchased this vehicle to replace a 2010 Jeep Wrangler Sport that had a 6 speed manual trans.  The Tacoma was purchased with a 6 speed manual transmission for more control for driving on the beaches in Delaware to surf fish.  The vehicle with only 500 miles on the odometer is getting 21 mpg. The performance, ride, handling, quality.....everything is outstanding.  I guess the big plus is that I purchased a 6 speed manual transmission, and not an automatic which many reviews complain about shifting and being sluggish.  Not so with the 6 speed manual.  My recommendation is buy with the manual transmission. Toyota is on the cutting edge for safety and technology.  The Tacoma comes with the Qi Wireless charging pad built into the tray area in front of the floor shifter.  I have a iPhone 6, so I bought a Benzalel Latitude Qi Wireless Charger Case for my iPhone 6.  It works perfectly....wireless charging.  If you have a Samsung you should be able to wireless charge your phone in the Tacoma without having to buy a special case.  I have no issue with the seating height of the front seats being 6'1\".  My wife who is 5'4\" loves the passenger seat height.  I did get the factory Toyota Predator Running Boards installed at the dealership so that my wife could get in easier.  The higher height of the truck makes for driving on the beach and crossing sand dune entry points very easy.   Zoom, Zoom.","10":"First off, my previous Tacoma was a 2010 model and only problems I had was the cabin fan acting up and getting replaced twice and put 170k miles on it. So I decided to move to the 2017 Tacoma and 7 months of owning it , I can say it's nice except, the transmission seems to slow down the engine with shifting. It did improve though but not 100% sold on this new type of transmission. On month 8, I went to dealer for noise issue on drivers side, then that turned into downing my truck for something completely different a recall. So month later, truck still at dealership and the recall has no fix yet for the leaking rear differential even though their letter clearly stated change gaskets and re torque.... I called headquarters and keep getting the run around about when they got a fix for this issue. As of today they say it can take up to 3-6 months to get a fix for recall. Now I don't know about ya'\"ll planning to buy one but if it takes that long to fix a recall it's not worth buying. Nothing better than paying for a truck you can't drive due to their mistakes.... thanks Toyota you may of lost a long time customer after this mess....","11":"I recently sold my 2002 Ford Sport Trac and purchased a 2017 Tacoma TRD Off Road. Boy oh, boy do I regret that. First off, this truck is not very cheap with a sticker price around $38,000 you expect a top quality truck. While the appearance of the truck looks sharp the engine and transmission are an absolute disaster. I live in an area with lots of hills and this truck struggles to conquer even the most minor of hills. I find myself having to mash down on the gas pedal to get to the top of any hill. Merging on the freeway is an ordeal as well and once you finally make it up to the highway speeds good luck maintaining that speed. The transmission is one of the worst if not thee worst transmission I've ever come across. (and I've owned Ford, Acura, Honda, Chevy, and Nissan vehicles). I cannot even begin to tell you how aggravating it is just driving around town. The transmission feels the need to downshift whenever it can and sometimes after accelerating from a stop the transmission struggles the find a gear and the RPM's shoot up to 3.5 and thats with an easy acceleration. The downshifting is by no means subtle either, you will rock forward and back and know when the truck is downshifting. I am completely disappointed and baffled. How, after all these years of making trucks has Toyota manged to ruin a perfectly good truck. If it was up to me I would've purchased a Chevy Colorado. Overall, I regret my decision to buy this truck.","12":"I didn't have much money and I didn't want to get a loan, so I got the 4 cylinder. Luckily I got a standard because you have to wind it out to keep it going sometimes. Very comfortable and a good drive. Strangely there is no intermittent setting on the windshield wipers. Otherwise I am a happy camper!","13":"This is a truck; the off road model rides a bit stiffer than a GMC or Chevy or even an SR5.  but it really shines when you get off road, and the toyota crawl function is absolutely fantastic in sand and dirt.  And the resell I got on the Tacoma I traded in was fantastic!","14":"Love the looks, interior and exterior of the Tacoma as well as the comfort, bells, and whistles so-to speak!  The only issue I have is with the transmission that is constantly shifting gears even at freeway speeds.  Signed on to the Toyota Owners site and see that others have the same complaint although some owners have posted a specific computer fix for the transmission program which I will insist on at my first service appointment.","15":"This is my ninth Toyota product, to include two previous Tacomas, a Tundra and a T-100, so I've come to expect a lot from Toyota based upon previous experience.  This truck has been a big disappointment and has been at the dealership more than all my other Toyotas combined (talking weeks at a time).  Beware of dealership modified vehicles.  Toyota will not fix an issue with my front differential because the dealership installed a level kit.  So I have a new truck with a 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty that Toyota will not fix; even though the dealership assured me the lift was covered when I purchased the vehicle.  Issues with this truck are front differential grinding noise (which Toyota has a Technical Service Bulletin for, but refuses to perform on my truck), automatic transmission that wants to run in fourth gear instead of sixth at highway speeds, poor highway mileage of 18.5 mpg, squeaking rear leaf springs, etc., etc. etc.  Now Toyota is recalling most 2016\/17 Tacomas because of leaking rear ends that could cause a catostraphic failure.  Toyota ain't what they used to be......","16":"I have had a 1996,2006, and now a 2017 Tacoma.  All were access cab v6 4x4.  This one is by far the best.  The ride difference from the 2006 to the 2017 is unreal.  It feels like you are riding in a sedan and not a truck.  The engine is noticeably stronger than my 2006 which also had a V6.  All of my trucks have been manuals.  I was pondering switching to the automatic this time but I was reading way too many negative things about it.  The manual on the 2017 shifts amazingly smooth. There is minimal to no driftback unless you are on a steep incline.  My 2006 would scream at 70mph.  I have to let off the gas on the highway with this one because before I know it I am doing 80.  I average anywhere between 18-22mpg depending how heavy I am being on the pedal.  The fuel mileage is the only negative thing I can at about the truck, and it is not even that bad.  The seats are comfortable and controls are simple yet efficient.  I would highly recommend the truck to anyone looking for a beefy midsize. I would go with the manual as it is a breeze to drive.","17":"I am disappointed in the amount of outside noise and basic engine noise, especially in shifting.   Also, if you have outside air blowing in from the vents on a day too cool for air conditioning, it seems like it is blowing in through the vents with the fan on 4, but actually the fan is off, and there is no way other way than to close off the vents to slow this down.   If you do close the vent vent covers, it then sounds like a windstorm is blowing through a partially open window.    Odd that such basic technology as air vents would have such a simple, easily solvable problem.    Also, my wife is 5' 4\" and has a hard time seeing the passenger side end of the hood when driving.   Again, a design flaw that favors looks over practicality.   And why can't Toyota make a truck that gets better gas mileage?","18":"Previous truck was tundra and as expected the Tacoma is much less comfortable on long trips.  Tacoma handles well, and is much easier to maneuver in tight spaces in town, but suffers in driving experience because of engine.  Does not feel like anywhere near 300 hp and with maximum torque way up near redline does not accelerate well at all.  If I drove it without knowing I would say about 180hp. Seems to want to cruse at 60-65mph. Will do 70 but mileage suffers dramatically.  Otherwise I like the truck just fine, but I hate the engine.","19":"Pros - Nice ride, solid feel driving, steering, handling great, power is fine for V6 3.5 (had a Chevy V8 5.3 previously so no comparison there), interior finishes are nice, leather, controls etc.    Cons- left knee hits door panel, radio with flat screen can be dangerous while driving (radio controls - driver must look away from the road to see it, mover higher and to driver), the front end has too much bounce\/travel over bumps, has some minor engine or trani vibrations coming through the pedals and steering, 6 speed shifts more than i would prefer - I would still recommend it for a medium size 4x4 truck - well built.  4 of 5  Kevin M.","20":"The engine has been a point of contention so I will make this short, normal every day driving you would never notice and by purchasing a manual transmission I am not subject to the \"indecisive\" automatic. I will say that it could do with a little more low end torque and wish there was a supercharger\/turbo option. Overall I love the truck and off-road comfort is amazing without sacrificing the on road sensibility.","21":"interior is nice and the truck design is sharp but the transmission is junk. It constantly shifts and it learns the way you drive which is a terrible option for a truck. The truck will cruise at 1000rpm which is way to low for that 3.5l. Not enough torque to pull that off. I like everything else but the driving experience is so bad i am forced to trade it in. Don't want to but i have never been more frustrated in a truck just driving down the street.","22":"The truck is a 2016 Tacoma 4x4 Limited. I drive the truck around town for the most part with occasional trip at highway speeds without jack rabbit starts. On occasion I will pull a loaded 22 ft enclosed trailer with it. When I pull the trailer, the truck has stored the driving history in the computer and operates like it has been driven without the trailer load and responds sluggishly. Even with the transmission being flashed 3 times it is a lot better than it was when first purchased but I hate the idea that the truck will respond to the computer history instead of responding to actual real time driving. I understand the idea of optimizing the operation of the truck for gas mileage but it is a TRUCK and expected to on occasion work like a TRUCK. I don't care about gas mileage when using it as a TRUCK. This is a case of too much Technology!","23":"Sometimes vehicle wants to idle up and down.  Found out has 2 types of fuel injection I understand the issue now.  Should explain at purchase.  So far really like the truck.  Much rather have than a Colorado or Canyon.  The Frontier's are more of a truck but steering radius is horrible and ride a lot rougher.  I think that floor mats should be standard equipment in these vehicles.","24":"I have the 2.7 ltr 4 cyl and the truck was making a whining noise which I almost didn't take to the dealer because I thought it was no big deal.....well I was wrong for sure as the truck had a bad engine block from the factory and now Toyota is having to put a new engine in the truck. I hope this isn't the first of many problems but I have seen other issues w the truck from other owners such as the real diff going out etc. I would consider another truck and Toyota won't buy this one back and the dealer is refusing to swap for a new truck only saying if I give them more money then I can get the exact same truck I have.....I have purchased 4 other Toyotas and I am really disappointed with the lack of quality in this one....","25":"Mileage:  Approximately 1100 U.S. Miles to date and climbing\n\nOK, so I\u2019ve owned Toyotas in the past, so some of this review relating to reliability and resale is related to my previous Toyota experience with safety, maintenance, and reliability, which were all totally awesome, by the way.  Toyota is the Gold Standard when it comes to reliability and resale.\n\nThis truck was purchased as an immediate replacement for a European lemon I had to offload quickly.  Since I didn\u2019t have that much time to shop, I went with what I knew and trusted from my younger years:  Toyota trucks.  \n\nAfter reading the reviews on this site, and elsewhere, I chose to go with a manual transmission.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been happier with a decision!  This truck has a great manual\u2026it does feel \u201csloppy\u201d when compared to a sports car, but this is a truck and for a truck, it is second to none.  You can shift with your pinky and the clutch is smooth as a baby\u2019s butt.  Paired with a manual transmission and that 3.5L V6 is a fine sized engine for this truck.  All truck owners have horsepower envy (part of owning a truck), but we all have to work with what we\u2019ve got and for a mid-sized truck, this engine is perfectly fine when paired with the manual transmission.  With the manual I have experienced none of the complaints I saw in other reviews; this truck, when paired with the manual, keeps up just fine on the highway.  I am a bit worried about towing, since it doesn\u2019t appear to reach peak torque until 4600RPM (that\u2019s pretty darn high), BUT that\u2019s really just a clutch wear issue and I am 100% confident that the geniuses at Toyota managed to install a heavy duty clutch that can take it.  \n\nOther benefits of a manual:  You embrace your masculinity, you remove the nannified computer installed between you and the transmission, you have superior control off-road or in inclement weather, you will cast aside those millennial stereotypes, you can downshift to third and comfortably blow past that big rig on the highway, the manual has better low-end torque in first, you\u2019ll know how to drive a rental car in countries besides the U.S. and Canada, etc.  Really, the list just goes on and on\u2026I believe there are dissertations written about the benefits of a manual in any off road vehicle, many likely involve Toyota trucks as the subject of said dissertation.\n\nDrawbacks of a manual:  You\u2019ll probably have to special order it or spend countless hours searching online.  I had to fly 1000 miles and drive it home to get one.  The manual Tacos literally fly off the dealer lots and the dealers won\u2019t even swap them\u2026they\u2019re guaranteed to sell.  Most of the dealers who are allocated a manual Taco mark it as already spoken for just to avoid dealer swaps.  lol.  In fact, if you do manage to find one on a lot, its more than likely it was a special order that someone backed out of and you\u2019ll need to be prepared to pay MSRP (I didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s because the folks at Sonic Automotive in Columbus, OH are cool cats and, at least from my dealings, were great to work with).  Otherwise, if you have the patience, just order exactly the truck you want and wait a couple months.   If I hadn\u2019t had to immediately offload an unreliable lemon daily driver, I would have gladly just ordered one.  Especially now that I\u2019ve had a chance to drive one\u2026well worth the wait if that\u2019s what you have to do!  Note:  Basically, the only drawback is trying to find a manual\u2026that\u2019s a darn good drawback to have!\n\nI bought a base model TRD off road.  Only option was the tow package and a few minor accessories (rubber mats, etc.).  The base model has the PERFECT amount of onboard technology.  Bluetooth for hands free phone, basic navigation that is reasonably intuitive, a basic touch screen infotainment system, and\u2026AC and cruise control.\n\nThe interior is nice, but not so nice you worry about getting the inside a little dirty.  It is a truck folks.\n\nThe vehicle controls, in true Toyota fashion, are logical, and give excellent tactile feedback.  Yes, knobs on the radio ARE important, despite the opinion of one reviewer. It is very important to be able to turn the volume up without being required to take your eyes off the road.  Regardless, there are also steering wheel controls that serve this purpose as well. Knobs for climate control are important for the same reason.  In my opinion, there is nothing more dangerous than a driver having to take their eyes off the road to perform constant and simple tasks such as adjusting temperature or the volume on the radio.\n\nThis little truck is solid and, so far, lives up to, and exceeds, my previously pleasant, happy, and satisfied Toyota truck experiences!  While it won\u2019t be my daily driver for very long (again, this was an emergency purchase), I intend to definitely keep this baby in the family for quite some time.  I simply cannot imagine a better vehicle for a teenager to learn in and drive.","26":"We just got into a 2017 pre runner double cab lease v6 sr5. The interior has more room than the previous tacoma double cab models. Over all we love the truck. I hate to lease but with only 2500 down and 267 a month for 48 months 12k miles a year. It is the only way we could do the payments. I thought it was a fair deal. When we get close to the end of the lease term i will have to see what will be best to do?","27":"I bought my 2017 Toyota Tacoma Limited at a very good price. The resale value and quality of truck is a big plus.","28":"Very easy buying experience at Boch Toyota in Norwood MA.  Big strong truck with every option available and rides like a sedan. I am extremely pleased with my new Tacoma!","29":"make sure you do home work on recommended internet price!","30":"I waited months for this truck. I could hardly hold my excitement in when the dealer finally called and said it had arrived.   I now have 4500 miles on it, and am considering selling it. This truck cannot maintain highway speeds  in Montana (80MPH). The constant shifting drive me crazy. I have two 4.0 V6 Toyota's, they are far superior to my new truck on the highway. I love the rest of the truck and would be 100% satisfied if it had a better engine.","31":"The trifold bed cover that comes with the truck, even if you do not want the $650 add on, is not worth the money. It Is advertized as water resistant, however I find it is resistant to nothing. It simply leaks. Also, I don't understand for the top dollar you pay why the seats are manual adjust.","32":"This is my third Tacoma...clearly I love these trucks.  The TRD PRO has great off-road capabilities...that I probably won't use.  I don't go \"rock crawling\" or anything crazy.  The PRO package is slightly over-priced in my opinion...but I still love it, which says alot.  I know I could have opted for the TRD Sport or Off-Road...but then it wouldn't be a \"PRO.\"  (I'm kinda a sucker).  I also lease...and the PRO has very high residual value which kept my payments low.  I wish I would have gotten a manual transmission because the automatic seems like it is searching for gears too much.  But manual tansmissions are incredibly (and frustratingly) rare.  Wish Toyota would make more manual transmission PRO's.  The interior is a big upgrade...heated leather seats, quiet ride, solid feel, love the instrumentation.  I love this truck.  If pressed to find a complaint, I would say I wish it were manual and had a moon roof (available on other packages).  I love the blue tooth features, but not a fan of Toyota's navi...I just use my iPhone app for that.  Some \"Entune\" apps are junk (Movie Tickets and restaurant reviews), but others are great (Pandora).  I don't like XM\/Sirius...not going to pay for radio.  The radio knobs are bad...I use the steering wheel controls.  (really...radio knobs??? pretty minor complaint, I know).  I don't tow anything, or haul excessively heavy loads.  I can easily handle half a cord of wood...which is about as heavy as I get.  I also shopped light trucks from Nissan, Honda Ridgeline, and GM's Colorado.  Honda Ridgeline was great, but felt too much like a car.    Didn't care for Nissan.  Colorado felt \"plasticy\" and too lightweight.  (fair disclosure...I don't care for GM vehicles, so not sure I gave it fair look.  But it seemed like it would be typical GM junk before 5000 miles).  Considered a Tundra (because it was at the dealership),  but I didn't want or need a full-size truck.  I love this Tacoma PRO.  Only have 4K miles on it...so things could change.  But right now, I love it, highly recommend it, and would totally buy it again.","33":"I traded an very good condition 08 Tacoma SR5 access I bought new for a 2016 TRD Off Road double cab after the re-design and finding out my 08 was worth over 80% of what I paid for it in 2008 and thats with a trade. What a great re-sale! After a year driving love my 2016 and the way it looks and drives. I too, do not like the transmission or less power and especially still not having a power seat available. Came so close to buying a Colorado due to this but, Tacoma re-sale can't be beat.","34":"I love the beefy look of the new Tacoma SR.  They have the style and size of the much more expensive TRD models.  The 4 cylinder motor doesn't provide much power for acceleration, but I like the gas mileage.  The road noise is much louder than I expected in a new car.  The ride is very stiff, and again not as good as I expected.  But for a few sacrifices, you get a great looking truck that is about $6,000 less than the TRD models.","35":"Very comfortable ride and quiet.  Large screen for the navigation and audio.  Beautiful metallic blue color and black wheel trim.","36":"I am very impressed with this truck.  It drives like a car on the road and is able to go off road and excel there too.  It is very quite inside and feels extremely well built.  You can just see, hear and feel the quality of this truck.  Definitely worth a test drive if you are considering getting a midsize truck.  I am absolutely loving mine!","37":"So many of these reviews focus on Off Road performance but like most of us it's a too the store or work vehicle. When you test drive this vehicle please find a roadway that you can travel 65 - 75 mph. Hills and curves will also help with this. I'll get right to the point. This transmission will shift constantly. Especially when Cruise is on. I mean a lot. Too the point that like myself you'll think something is wrong with the vehicle but according to the dealer it's normal. Thankfully I don't travel Highway miles all that much but the few long trips I did make.....WOW. Other than that I'm happy with the truck. It's my 2nd Tacoma. I can say that a 3rd may not happen unless Toyota takes care of this issue. It's definitely a game changer.","38":"Pros: It's a Toyota truck. I fully expect it to run long after the body falls off. Utility & capability are both great, and it can go pretty much anywhere with 4x4 terrain modes and a locking diff. Though its got a long wheelbase meaning tight trails or steep drops will pose issues with turning radius and break over angles. Cons: Even though the engine has plenty of power it feels gutless. This is likely due to gearing choices and an overly aggressive shift pattern intended to improve gas mileage but it can be annoying in stop and go traffic. Finally, the entertainment system is a complete joke.  I understand that touch screens are all the rage, but this is a truck, I can't use the screen wearing gloves or with dirty hands. Second, Toyota has decided to build their own interface instead of allowing Apple Car Play or Android Auto. Toyota isn't a technology company and nobody wants yet another app (especially a poorly made one) to control the infotainment in their vehicle. To add insult to injury the navigation system is horrible. It's hard to add an address and when you do it often can't be found. Traffic conditions aren't usually accurate so there's little value in the built-in system. My phone sitting on the seat has none of those problems. Overall: If you're looking for a great, capable midsize truck, this is about the best there is.","39":"Fun to drive","40":"This really is a best in class vehicle.  Ride, handling, comfort, well thought out in all respects except one.  Why Toyota cant get this right is a mystery to most...still underpowered but now we have a transmission that cannot hold a constant speed going up a hill.  Even the slightest incline causes the transmission to downshift, upshift, downshift, upshift and so on.  Only way to avoid the constant shifting is to manually downshift and keep the lower gear manually used and not depend on the automatic transmission.   Unfortunate as this vehicle is outstanding in almost every other aspect of a light truck ride.  Wishing and hoping Toyota someday brings the Helix (diesel) platform to the USA.  Overall happy but when going uphill the transmission is really annoying.","41":"I purchased my Tacoma Off Road one month ago. 22\" of snow over the weekend - 100 yd very steep uphill driveway - unplowed - truck never noticed it. No problem in 4WD high. It's a beast in the snow. Cool factor - my high school kids and thier friends love the vehicle.","42":"Replaced a 2001 Tacoma TRD. It was a great truck that was very dependable. If this Tacoma is 1\/2 as good I will be very satisfied.","43":"Had this truck for 2 months and I am in love with it. The ga she mileage is mediocre averaging about 17.5 in town and 22 on the highway but it's a truck. Nobody buys a truck for it's excellent gas mileage. I've been off roading once and the 4WD system in 4LO got me through the local trail just fine but I did use the crawl control feature just to say I tried it even though it's not necessary. The crawl control and Multi terrain select features are great toys to have for off roading which is one of the reasons I went for the off road over the sport model. Some have been complaining about the transmission shifting gears to often and I did experience it early on but now that my truck has 3k miles on it the transmission is more in sync. Once the truck breaks in its far more responsive. I'm 6'1 and I fit just fine in my taco and my family members fit all fine in the backseat. I love my 2017 taco and I will drive her to the wheels fall off and don't care to own any other pickup truck on the market.","44":"This has been a great truck as far as handling, 4 wheeling, and the amenities inside the cab. My biggest complaint with it is that it spends way too much time gear searching.  Especially on the freeway.  If this rig was a manual, it would be a 5 star rig across the board. It has sufficient acceleration off the line, but as son as you get to about 30-35 MPH it lugs down.  It seems to be geared toward fuel conservation. There is an option called the ECT(electronically controlled transmission) that you can push to eliminate some of that. But it still shifts up way too fast. I just bought it 3 weeks ago so I'm still getting used to it. Everything else about it is great. If you don't mind lousy gas mileage you can always use the ECT. However the combined fuel mileage has not been anywhere near 22.5. It's more like 17.5 city, and 20.5 highway. Time at the pump sucks, but the rest of the truck makes it totally worth it.","45":"I wanted Toyota reliability and quality and the offroad capabilities.  Tacoma seemed like everything I wanted.  but my daily commute on the highway is very frustrating.  it's severely underpowered and difficult to keep steady speed as transmission is shifting gears constantly.  acceleration is poor and even other cheap low end cars pass this truck all the time.  I have to floor it to climb even the slight uphill.  it's really a bad driving experience.","46":"This is my first truck, after owning bars and small SUV. I have a model with manual transmission. I'm getting only 18 mpg on the highway. I expected a little bit better. I bought good stuffed tires and took the truck on snowed in mountain passes. In 4wd it holds the road like a champ. I have a full confidence in it. In 2wd it gets some fishtailing that is immediately corrected by traction control (I didn't have any weight in the bed). Breaking is great. I could feel ABS activating only once, when doing aggressive breaking from 60 mph on sheer ice. It partially may be thanks to good winter tires. Low beam headlights are good, high beam--best I've seen. Build quality seems to be OK. I found cross-threaded bolt holding belly pan. I have yet to address it with the dealer. I think materials used on dashboard could be better. My wife has 2010 Subaru Impreza and it feels much more refined, although cost just over 1\/2 of a price for Tacoma. Telescopic steering wheel is a joke. I can't lift it high enough to comfortably get out of truck. It traps my right thigh between the wheel and the seat. The truck is also missing driver's side handle to assist in getting in and out of the cab (I'm fairly fit in late thirties). The biggest gripe I have is the fact that heated seats come only as part of $2000 package. I don't need parking sensors or moonroof, heated seats are nice to have in cold climate. All in all, I'm happy with the truck.","47":"Traded in my 2011 Trd Sport Tacoma for one reason and one reason only the ride was rough I loved this truck.  Then came the 3rd gen. Tacoma in 2016 saw it and heard about all the trans problems of 5th and 6th gear confused so I waited for this  BLAZING BLUE 2017.  Get looks from everyone and everyone comes up to me saying beutiful truck...which I think is absulotely true.  Now the ride is like riding in a big F-150 or a Lexus it is so queit and comfortable.         It get better:      Averaging 24 mpg in the city.  I drove it on a 33 mile freeway drive the other day with about 3 stop lights got 29 mpg... I am so so stoked. Open the door w\/o pushing key button then push start the start button and your off to a smooth quiet comfortable ride luxury all the way.  Is so so easy to start and go.  Look forward to driving this luxury truck and easy to park.  Can't wait for my next drive.....get one for yourself.","48":"This is my 3rd Truck and boy does it drive much better then the 1970 Toyota truck or my 1983 Dodge Rampage. That saying a lot since the dodge rampage drove like a car with nice bucket seats. The truck takes a little getting used to but like any new vehicle it going to take time to adjust to different settings. I was thrilled because my insurance only went up 10 bucks from driving a 2006 Acura TSX and I was not paying all that much for great coverage under 400 every 6 months.  The truck likes to conserve on gas yes but when you need power just push the pedal down firm and you got full on get up and go power. If your taller then 6 FT you may end up hitting your head on the ceiling. For the most part though the ride is smooth and compliant especially on freeway.  If your looking to get some extra weight under the wheels definitely get the Tonneau cover. It helps with getting more grip on the tires and improves gas mileage. Also the engine is much more compliant between gear shifts or maybe the computer just learned to adjust to my drive style. Either way it should be a boon to you because you can now lock your bed and lock the tailgate. Which is one of my concerns since the tailgate is so easy to remove.","49":"Go Long Bed baby","50":"I'vetaken it offroad,not only for woodcutting and work, but on some pretty gnarly 4wd trails. It's bone stock and unstoppable.  You he only down side is now I spend most of my time looking at all the cool stuff I can buy for it!","51":"After buying 4 new Taco's we know them pretty well. We had issues with the transmission on our 16' that have finally been resolved with an update to the computer. Now we love it. It tows an Edge Water 205CX powerboat really well. Its close to the limit of 6,800 lbs but really pulls strong. We use the ECT button and keep it out of 6th by using the manual option on the shifter. This one is the best yet. Our last being a 15' limited. Very quiet and smooth. We easily get 24 mpg with a fairly heavy foot on the hwy. Like many others we wish the seats were power and with more adjustments including the steering wheel. All in all it's another winner Taco. \nUpdate 5\/29\/17 Running great. Seats still need more adjustment. A bit short in length and too low. The steering wheel will not telescope enough for my long legs. The leather is a bit stiff but then I'm comparing it to a Beamer so its really not fair. The GPS is very user friendly. The JBL sound really rocks. Nothing else to report.","52":"Went from a 11 year old F-150 super crew to 2017 Tacoma DC Long bed, because I wanted the sporty looking Tacoma, with a functional bed size.","53":"To be honest, I was not in the market for a mid-size truck when I started shopping for a new vehicle, but after a ton of research, the Taco offered the best \"bang for the buck\" so to speak.    My 2007 Avalanche was stolen, so I was forced into the new vehicle market.  That Avalanche was the best truck I ever owned hands down, so I was pretty biased going to the various dealer lots.   After driving the new GM's, and Fords and in seeing their cost, I opted to go to a used car lot.   They had a 2015 Tacoma TRD PRO that I test drove and I felt really good in the truck.  Since the cost of the 2015 was only $4k cheaper than what a 2017 brand new one was,(gotta love how these hold value)  I went for the new.     After 4 months of ownership, I thought I'd throw this review out.    First out, the truck is really a good truck.  It does the daily commuter routine really well, and the V6 has the oomph to get out in front of traffic when you are merging if you really get on the gas pedal.  The off road capability is incredible and really impressed me on some back country fire roads on my occasional fishing trips.   I haven't used it yet, but I really do like the piece of mind the \"Crawl Control\" gives me.    The gas mileage is as advertised, but I'm a bit of a lead foot, so you may even beat the estimated if you are light on the gas pedal.   All the \"technology\" features are user friendly and intuitive.   The real problem I have with this truck is the size.  I'm a pretty big guy, 6'1\" 240, so the truck with me, the wife, kid and dog makes for a pretty cramped feeling that I never got with the full size truck.   If you are coming from a full size to this class of vehicle, definitely work with the dealer to see if you can test it out over a weekend so you fully grasp the space you are going to lose.    My other big issue is the carpet is a pain to clean dog hair out of.   For some reason it acts like velcro when you try to vacuum it up, but that isn't that huge of an issue because duct tape works wonders for this task. It just takes a lot longer to clean out than my old vehicle did, so again, I'm biased.   My third gripe is the seats.  I've tried every setting they have and I can't get that comfortable, its almost like I'm between settings - either my back is too upright or I'm too laid back.  Also, not being able to lower the seat brings me to bump my head on the roof on bumpy terrain.  This is annoying but not overly so.  Toyota really needs to have a power seat function.   For the money, you can't beat this trucks functionality and of course they hold their value really well.    The amount of accessories you can get from both Toyota and 3rd parties is incredible, and they add even more functionality to a very capable and functional truck.   Overall I'm happy with my purchase.","54":"This is a truck, not a truck on a car platform like the Ridgeline.  I like alot of what reviewers don't like about it.  I like the high step in - 20 inches...which means it will get through the snow drifts at the end of my long driveway.  Its a smooth ride as trucks go.  The bed is deep, where the Ridgeline is shallow.   The instrumentation display is much better than the Chevy\/GMC IMO.  Sure you sit with your legs a bit straight in the front seat, but once again, I know it will get through anything without bottoming out.  The resale value, and reliability are a the top of the segment.  Its a blast to drive.  Sure it can be a bit sluggish if you are trying to maximize the MPGs merging on the freeway, but all you have to do is either press the ECT button, or push harder on the peddle to overcome it.  My 16 year old did that and actually improved the MPG.  Go figure.","55":"This vehicle is unique, I've had Fords 150, 250, Chevys K5, C2500, Dodge's Ramchargers, Honda Ridge, MDX, but with that all said, and 58 years later, I pissed off the sales department, but heck, I signed the dotted line for 36x15k per yr, 2017 Taco Limited.  I will say I due have a concern about the transmission, acting like a PMSing woman, but my bad azz days r in my mirror.  The jury is still out in general, but for the 1,700 miles I've put on so far, mostly city, 500 highway.  I'm ok with this thang.   Acura MDX was my fav, but I needed an open air pickup due to the chemicals I transport.  But I've been complimented x 4 times, about the looks of the taco, me I'm a fat ugly porkroll.  But the lil runt gets a 8.5 on a scale of 1 to 10 with me.","56":"I love this truck.  Gas mileage is OK, but it's a truck so I didn't expect to get super mileage.  My only complaint it there is not trim package that has a power seat or a manual way to raise and lower it.  After 4000 miles, I'm used to it.  I considered a Ford and Chevrolet that are bigger, but went with the Tacoma because of the styling, resale value, and I don't need a full size.  If you are very tall, this might not be the truck for you. Or any mid-sized truck.","57":"Love this truck, only thing I found was front lights are not a good as the 2014.","58":"Purchased this TRD sport in Blazing Blue Pearl in August of 2016.  Highway driving I get over 27 mpg at 55-60 mph.  Around this small town I am getting 19, which is much better than my 2015 Tacoma with the 4.0 V6.  The truck is more comfortable and definitely quieter.  I have owned several Tacoma's and this one seems to be the best.  The navigation works well as do all the apps. I am very happy with this truck.","59":"Do your homework before you visit the sharks that will gladly charge you as much as possible. Web resources like Edmunds are a great start.","60":"Due to EPA mandated for fuel efficient vehicles, it seems little sluggish for normal operation.","61":"just traded my 2013 taco limited for a 2017 model. i hated to see the old one go but the more i drive the new one the more i am knocked out by it's performance and features. everything i didn't like about the 2013 model seems to to have been addressed by toyota in the past four years. as i understand from my salesman, toyota brought in lexus engineers and they made improvements in noise control, quietness, and the ride - and it works. if you have ever fantasized about lexus making a pickup, this is it.","62":"After doing a lot research and talking to people who own other tacomas, I decided to get one. After previously driving a 13 Camry se and 14 RAV4 limited, I've got to say for a truck, Toyota has done an incredible job. Everything seems more durable and a lot easier to keep clean than my previous Toyotas. The look of this vehicle I can't stop looking at it. My parents just bought 16 Chevy Silverado 2500hd and although it's an amazing truck as well but impressed that a truck that's $13k less comes with a bed liner. The ride is great and people complain about the seats, I'm 511 and body builder build and I'm perfectly comfortable. I do wish there was height adjustable but I'm still comfortable. I love that the speed limit pops up on the instrument cluster. Gas mileage, this is a truck, not an unibody vehicle,  but averaging 20.4 in mixed driving and lots of Boston traffic. Wish I got tech package with blind spot etc like rav but can't have everything. After test driving a 17 Colorado, I feel I got more bang for my buck. Bedliner, bed power outlet, keyless ignition, and the best resale value of any value on the road and it was kind of no brainier. Everyone I ask how you like your Tacoma always says I love it. I couldn't be happier and can def feel this truck will last a long time. My daily commute is hour to work and back and I don't regret getting rid of my rav. I'm comfortable and just love the ride after all this is a truck and seems to me lot quieter than I thought it would be. But this is my opinion do your research and test drivers, ask people how they like their tacomas and make your decision, personal preference is key these days....","63":"Most Tacoma owners add aftermarket modifications to their trucks. I will be another as the options are endless and fun. However, without these modifications, this truck is a comfortable beast right off the lot. It has power, stamina, just enough clearance to get you through most obstacles, and great looks. I do wish however that Toyota would have given more luxurious options (for example: interior with brown leather seats and trim in more than just the Limited model). I am so far very happy with my new Taco and believe I will continue to be happy for many years with it. In the first 1000 miles of driving, I've already taken this truck through the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California twice with no complaints and I plan on many back road \/ off road adventures through the years.","64":"More room inside than the older models, safety features are great with cross traffic detection and blind spot warnings. Dealer support has been great through the whole process.","65":"I've been looking for a midsize truck. I was originally set on the GMC Canyon but after seeing all the safety recalls and consumer complaints I decided to pass. I ended buying the 2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off road 4x4 double cab short bed, automatic, towing package and JBL premium tech package. My biggest complaint was the shifting problem with the transmission. After having the 2016 TSB for the issue applied (and transmission fluid filled to the correct level) at the dealer the issue is now resolved. I couldn't be happier with the truck but miss the HP and torque of my old 2004 GMC HD2500 with the 6 liter V8 (but not the gas mileage or rough ride when not towing). I do some offroading, and minimal towing (3000 lbs or less) with two kids and this was a great downsize from the \"big\" truck. Not to mention Tacoma reliability and resell value.","66":"I have wanted a Tacoma for as long as I can remember. Iv'e had three other trucks in my life, a 1978 Chevy 3\/4 ton, a 2009 Titan, a 2010 RAM 3\/4 ton diesel. I wouldn't consider towing much of a trailer or hauling much of a load with the Tacoma but I guess that's not what it's made for. I bought the Tacoma for reliability. I have 50,000 miles on it with no real problems. I do find the transmission shifting frequently on the highway trying to find a comfortable gear to be in, a little annoying but I can live with it. I have had issues with the Entune system not functioning with my phone but I'm not sure if it's my phone (Motorola Turbo II) or the Entune system itself. It seems to only work when it wants, giving me a \"system busy\" notice on the screen. The dealer said the Entune system was set up to be used optimally with an iPhone.  The Tacoma is not a rocket but it does have nice acceleration. I just like the truck and plan on having it for a few years.","67":"leaking differential (recall) - Toyota has my truck and I'm in a rental - they don't know when it will be fixed and Toyota does not have a fix a this time .","68":"The transmission sucks - shifts hard, lunges out of park or during slow acceleration and can't find 5th or 6th gear while cruising. The yota fan boys play it down, but it's terrible. The USB port continually loses connection with my phone and the BT requires me to forget the device and repair, otherwise the sound speeds up by about x4 for maybe a second and then stops, but repeats this cycle continually. MPG is pretty solid - 20ish for combined DC driving and up to 23+ on mostly highway trips. Another positive is I can fit my 5,4 and 2 y\/o in the backseat.","69":"As in other reviews, the windshield spiders easily. The first hit made a small aggravating spider. The second small rock that hit far from the first made a tiny spot that at first was almost unnoticeable.  It was quiescent for a few days then expanded to the whole windshield in the sun in one afternoon. It's $1200 or more to replace with the original. Turns out the old Tacoma windshields fit and are much, much, less expensive. The trucklet has only 11,000 miles.","70":"I have been a lifelong Toyota customer until now. This is the 6th Toyota I have owned or leased and it's the worst experience I have had with one. Engine sounds like it's 20 years old. Shifts hard and lurches at lower speeds mostly during acceleration. I have had it at the dealer no less than 6 times. Rode with a tech that agreed it's not right. All the did was  reflash the ECU. There have been 2 TSBs they performed and problem persists. I called Toyota customer care and all they did was send me back to the dealer. I should probably go lemon law route but who has the time to deal with it. Really pisses me off every time I get in it.","71":"My wife and I were looking at pickup trucks and went to see the new Toyota Tacomas as we had an '09 Tacoma.  The new body and size is a great improvement over the earlier years.  It also has much better styling and features.  I am about 5'10\" and getting in and out of the driver side can be difficult as my head hits the roof line of the door opening.  My wife is about 5'2\" and has no problems with it.  Surprisingly I have no trouble getting in or out on the passenger side. The dealer we purchased through ours through was great to deal with and offered an excellent trade value for our '09 as well as very good price on the truck we bought.","72":"I'll make it short and sweet toyota made a big mistake by changing to the 3.5 liter engine. This new version is so underpowered. It made my decision for a new truck easy. I'll check by with toyota in a few years to see if they have fixed the problems. Also the GoPro camera mount built in is absolutely stupid. Technology changes over time but that mount on your windshield doesn't. Same situation for the built in phone charger. Epic failure in the part of toyota on this one.","73":"It handles well on mountain roads. The stereo has decent sound\/speakers. It is comfortable for long trips with my family (front and back seats are comfortable). It has worked great for towing my camping trailer.","74":"Purchased in Jan. 2016.  After a few weeks I noticed a lag\/hesitation when I would try to accelerate, followed by erratic transmission shifting.  I thought it was part of the breaking in process.  The problem got worse.  I called Toyota Corp. and they opened a case file.  A few days later they called and said no recall had been issued on the vehicle so they would take no corrective action.  I had the dealer do several software updates in hopes this would remedy the problems.  All efforts were met with negative results.  My Tacoma was driving so badly I was concerned I could potentially become involved in a traffic crash so it set parked.  On April 1, 2017, I traded in my Tacoma for a 2016 4Runner which runs 100% better than the 35 thousand dollar piece of junk truck that Toyota sold me.  Very Disappointing.","75":"Engine feels under power and the transmition is the worse I ever driven. Hard shifting from park to reverse and reverse to drive.","76":"The drivetrain of the 2016-2017 Toyota Tacoma is a total joke.  This engine transmission combo belongs in a minivan, not an off-road truck.  Toyota should be ashamed.  Additionally, the infotainment system is also a joke!  Where is Carplay or Google support?  Toyota seriously needs a team of UX people for their software designs.","77":"I have had three 2nd GEN Tacoma double cab and now a 2016 Tacoma and one 2nd gen. They have the number one resale value of all vehicles sold in the United States,  that pretty much says it all. The one thing that I will ding Toyota on, is the tranny' in the 3rd gens. I'm just not a big fan of them over the 2nd gens. The interiors designed very well, I am a 6 foot man and I sit very comfortably in it. The exteriors are very eye-catching and are very useful for out door use. I base the vehicle's I buy on how overall useful they are to me. This is why, this is my fourth Tacoma double cab I've owned.","78":"This is my first Taco.  I had fairly high expectations given what I had read.  I tested both the four and six engines, decided on the six because 1 mpg was worth it to get power.  After having owned it for six months (4,500 miles) I would probably not buy it again.  The first issue was a rattle in the door.  Five trips to the dealer eventually fixed it (along with replacing a door panel and some additional foam going in the A pillar).  A couple of more rattles have made themselves known, but not yet annoying, or I am just dreading the trips to fix them, not sure.  The second issue is the engine\/transmission.  I have three issues.  1. the MPG is OK in the city and lousy on the freeway.  My most recent trip was about 800 miles, pulled 22 mpg.  Not loaded or towing and stayed pretty much within speed limits and I have a tonneau cover on the bed.  This brings me to problem 2., the transmission.  I have had the TSB performed to deal with hesitation between park and drive (works), the transmission was also down about 20 ounces of fluid.  The transmission still downshifts very poorly, with a very untotyota like \"clunk\" when coming to stop and going from third to second or second to first.  The transmission can best be described as nervous and unsettled as it hunts to find gears going up and down small grades, hills, etc.  In the previously mentioned trip, it was continually downshifting one to two gears going up hills and grades, with the tach going from just under two thousand rpm to over 3,000.  This brings me to 3., the engine.  It is very smooth, but mileage is just awful.  The engine feels very under powered going up hills and grades unless it drops all the way down to third or fourth gear.  Some one likened it to shifting up in an manual gear too soon, it \"lugs\" and that is a great way to describe it.  Even on a flat road, you are going to have to mash it to keep with traffic.  I am going to take it back to the dealer regarding the poor mpg, maybe a different one, and see if they can correct it.  But again, would probably not but it again, and would certainly not recommend to anyone.  What a complete disappointment.","79":"This car is a truck.  It does not handle like a car, does not accelerate like a car, nor ride like a car.  I love this truck.  Its a blast to drive.  It has a 20 inch step in, so you feel like you are straddling a pony.  I have had no issues with mechanical breakdowns, no rear-ends failing, or transmissions failing like I have heard on the Chevy.  I have driven in 9 inches of unbroken snow up a hill with no problem.  Never saw the inside of a mechanics garage until the 5000 mile tire rotation. The engine and transmission adapts to your style.  If you hypermile it, you can get up to 25 MPG.  I did that when I drove into Detroit.  Hypermiling means pressing and letting up on the gas.  I average 20 combined.  This is not bad.   The sitting position takes some getting used to, but like I said you are straddling a pony.  I can't wait to take it offroading.  Have fun.","80":"I have 5000 miles on my 2016 Toyota Tacoma and was not too happy with the way the transmission shifted. On my first oil change I mentioned a transmission update, and my dealer was surprised I knew about that. They told me there was an update available and I am a lot happier with the shifting. I got my information reading these reviews. So people do read these","81":"The first few months were a bit rocky with the new Tacoma.  I had a suspension bushing go bad that caused a great deal of squeaking (sounded like a 30 yr old truck with a bad springs),  annoying rattle in the headliner and the lagging \/ frequent shifting \/ wrong gear transmission issues that everyone has discussed in these reviews already.  After a couple trips to the dealer to get those things all worked out, I'm a fan.  If you have a early 2016 model, go ask your dealer to reprogram the transmission with the latest update.  I got mine done in early Dec 2016 and it made a night and day difference.   The transmission has largely stopped acting laggy, the acceleration is much better and it drives like a different truck.   If you are buying today, it's a great truck and I'd highly recommend it.  Like any new model release, the early 2016's just had a few bugs that need to get worked out.  Toyota has excellent dealer support (this is my 3rd Toyota truck) and did a great job of taking care of any issues.","82":"i live in the Midwest drive on gravel roads daily and have had hundreds of rocks hit my windshield causing chips occasionally that can be repaired. I bought a brand new 2016 Tacoma and have had it 6 months the first tinny pebble that hit my windshield caused a 10 in crack. While checking on cost for new one I have discovered that I'm not alone. Apparently these windshields are thinner than normal and crack with the slightest impact. At $1200 for junk oem  replacement there needs to be a recall and redesign. Other than that I like the truck.","83":"I love Toyota  great trucks for the last 20 years I drove Ford and Toyota trucks but my new truck is a Toyota Tundra limited and I loved better than Ford","84":"I had  own a 2005 tacoma  and drove it for 9 years with onlh one issue the air conditioner stop working. Sld the truck and had purchase a jeep but aftrr 3 years i decided  to purchase the ne 2016 tacoma trd sport. It was the worst  decision  i have made in purchasing  a new truck. The transmission is crap for it canot decide what gear to run in and the truck has a surge when you are trying to park or pill into a garage. I have had the truckmin the shop twice and went today and talk to a sevice adviser and was told that there was nothing they could do for this is the way the truck will perform and they were done. The truck is omld six months old with 6k miles. I am going tomorrow  and trade  it in for a Dogde Ram. Hopefully  Toyota will get there act together for if people stop buying there products for they are no longer in my book as the best vechicle on the road.","85":"Like the truck but very disappointed in the engine & transmission. It shifts at very poor power curves and seems to very weak. In the electronics transmission control mode, it performs better but still feels weak. My wife's car has the 3.5 eco boost Ford engine and it's like night and day performance difference. Yes I recognize the turbos make a difference but the performance of the 2016 Tacoma feels like a weak 4 cylinder. When you push the pedal down it will shift into a lower gear and start to move fairly rapid but is very abrupt shift. I'm not wanting a race car and not a off-road enthusiast just disappointed in the engine performance. Like the looks and quality and have had no problems with the truck. Pulled a small utility trailer with my lawn mower and it only shifted to 6th gear a couple of times driving on a level road.","86":"I sold a 2006 Chevy Tahoe and leased a 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe for a year just to wait for the 2016 Tacoma... BIG MISTAKE!!!  My Tacoma has been in the shop 5 times over the last year for an electrical issue (interior lights fuse keeps popping) and now the radio resets a couple of times a week.  It is in the shop now again... same problem.  Toyota coroporate could not care less... they keep putting new fuses in and a few weeks later it happens again.  Corporate sent me a letter back saying in essance - \" There is no problem.\"   Gilroy dealership is trying, but can't find the problem even with the help of the manufacturer (supposedly).  My other complaints are like the others... transmission changes gears all of the time, gas mileage is not good and I have to duck to get in it and I'm 5'10\".  The extererior is nice and I do like the controls.  I'm stuck with it for another year and a half... I hope the 2018 or 2019 is redesigned.  If not, than I will NOT buy another Tacoma (sadly- because it is the truck I want).   My loaner is a 2017 TRD Tacoma-- no changes from 2016... DISAPPOINTING!!!","87":"truck has 1300 miles on it going into the shop for the second time for trans issues 1st time in they did the tsb update didn't fix the problems shifts into high gear to early causes truck to lug\n\n\ntruck idles up when about stopped causing it to lurch forward and  causing a drive line clunk also clunk off and on while driving slow speed a\/c is off\n\nStruggles to maintain highway speeds on moderate hills, lots of gas pedal action and reluctant down shifting during wich it will start to surge and bog down very disappointed in this truck have had several Toyotas since the early 90's and this one may go in for a trade I cant stand driving it anymore the way it shifts is horrible 1300 miles I shouldn't have to be taking it to the shop again its already been there once for 4 days and going back again not a happy customer any more","88":"Had a great truck in the 2008 Tacoma thought the 2016 was a beautiful truck had to have one. But the truck is not as good as it looks it has the lugging problem that all other 2016 Tacoma trucks have it also has a roaring going down hill when you let off the gas and if you are on interstate it jumps from one gear to the other like riding bucking horse. Toyota tried the new fix still same thing for 13,000 miles first they said it would get better when I took it in at 2,000 said the computer had to adjust to my driving well it has not yet so my next move is to trade this truck if they cannot fix there problem.","89":"Driver seat is very comfortable for long trips. Truck is smooth riding and quiet on interstate trips. Got model with premium sound and navigation - very nice! Like voice command feature. Navigation is very easy to program and use. 6.1\" touch screen is adequately sized. Steering wheel controls for radio and voice command features selections are easy to use. Programming center info panel between tach and speedometer is a bit puzzling but manageable. Literally dozens upon dozens of electronic warning and info signals that can be generated. Has backup camera with warning buzzer. Can easily program about a dozen or so maintenance messages that will pop up at your specified mileage or date settings. Hands free cell phone pairing using bluetooth is great feature. Cruise control is easy to use. Like the power door locks, windows, and exterior mirrors. Three moveable cargo hold downs on each side of bed are very handy. Bed comes with bolt-in liner that covers top rails all around bed.  Wish seats were power and that heavy hood had spring loaded hinges that would hold it up. 4WD Hi engages and disengages smoothly on fly. Automatic transmission shifts very smoothly and has a MT like feature that allows selecting and shifting gears. Access cab doors make putting stuff into back easy. Access cab rear seats are totally inadequate for seating. Rear seat headrests block rear view; but, can be lowered easily. Has a button to turn on exterior mirror heater. Touch screen has dozens of programmable features that are reasonably intuitive to find and set. Center console has 3 cup holders plus there are 2 bottle holders on each door.","90":"I owned a 2016 DCLB TRD-OR for 6 months and 14,000 miles. I tried really hard to like this truck, but the engine and transmission combination in this vehicle is absolutely horrible. It can't make up its' mind what gear it wants to be in, constantly upshifting and downshifting. The slightest incline on the highway and your greeting with a downshift into 4th gear. I had to search for and find the TSB supposedly to 'fix' this (called the 'Shift Feeling Enhancement', and force the dealer to apply it. It only marginally helped. The straw that broke the camels back was the horrible highway gas mileage- western states have posted 80mph and I was lucky to get 16 mpg highway. Even in flat as a pancake IOWA we averaged 14 mpg over a stretch of 100 miles. The dealer told me to wait until after 10,000 miles to let the engine really break in and my mpg should get better. It didn't. We just traded the Tacoma for a double cab Silverado 1500 LTZ with the big 6.2L v8 and 8spd tranny. On my first tank of gas I am averaging 19mpg- 3 mpg better than my Tacoma ever did. There are much better trucks out there- the Tacoma is sorely disappointing.","91":"I bought this truck because of Tacoma's seemingly historical reliability...however, it's been a mess of issues.  Horrible transmission, low power, vibrations in the drive-train somewhere, rattling windows, shift flares, entune radio that reboots when it feels like it.  Terribly dissapointed in the quality.  And, to boot, Toyota claims everything is operating normally! HA! What a load of crap.","92":"I have a 2016 TRD 4x4 off road, bought it with (7) miles on it about 2k it started shaking when driving on the highway I thought it was a balance issue, nope, it's been 10k miles, replaced tires, replaced wheels, balance done 8 times.....the steering wheel shakes the whole truck shakes, everything in the truck shakes it's comical, \"not when it's yours\" anybody who goes for a ride mentions it, it feels like a salvage truck, the dealership tells me \"oh it's a truck\" BS My last truck was a 2013 Tacoma it was totaled hit a center divide, the frame shifted, I fixed it that truck felt better then this \"clean title\"\n\n25k update \nTransmission feels like it has sticky gears, down shifts are very hash, dealer did a ecu reset, which went back to same feeling in couple days\n\nEngine to me feels like it lost power, feels very sluggish \nOil changes never we above 5.5k\n\nEngine feels very outdated, my wife drives and tells me \"this truck is hella slow, everybody passes me up\"","93":"I know there are a several people that are not happy with their 2016 Tacomas for various reasons posting here.  One of the consistent reasons that come up is the transmission shifting issue.  I noticed the same issue after my first week of ownership.  Driving from Dallas to Shreveport, the transmission was constantly hunting for gears and if I was using cruise control, the slightest incline would cause it to downshift and stay stuck in 4th gear.  This was incredibly annoying, but I knew Toyota would fix it.  Now that Toyota has finally fixed this issue, my truck is perfect.  If you are having the transmission issue, ask your service dealer to apply the T-SB-0077 transmission update.  I own the double cab TRD off road model and it performs very well on the road and trails.  If I had it to do all over again, I would probably just buy the 4x4 SR model and do all of my own customizations instead of buying the Toyota upgrade models.","94":"I have had two Tacoma's prior to this 2016 and it seems that they have gone down the drain as far as quality.  I have this truck for 6 Months and it has been in shop more then I have driven it.  issue with the radio it went completely out and it took a month to repair.  Noise coming from the right drivers side top dash. it has gone in two time is for the same issue and this will be the third time.  Not happy at all with this Tacoma I been a loyal fan of the Tacoma this was my 4th Tacoma but sadly to say that it will be my last.  Thinking of trading this one in and getting an American truck.","95":"It rides well, has a smooth engine and transmission, good sound system, the bluetooth is great, all other options are great. It is a little tall for a short person to get in.","96":"You Have to sit in this case before buying it. There are some body types that are going to uncomfortable in the driver's seat.","97":"This is my 5th Toyota and 3rd TRD off road 4x4. It has stalled out on me 4 times ( once making a left turn and almost got hit) Toyota has had if for a total of  6 weeks of my 10 months of ownership. The last time it was in for 4.5 weeks so the Toyota engineers could look at it and the answer was they tightened some loose connections. I am not feeling real confident with this truck or the Toyota company. Soon as it is lemoned I am most likely buying a Chevy Colorado, only because of Toyota customer service","98":"I purchased a 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD sport and the transmission shifts way to much and the gearing seems to be off when shifting.very lousy design and would not recommend this transmission to anyone looking to purchase a Tacoma,hopefully Toyota will correct there mistake.","99":"The bucket seats in the truck are very uncomfortable.  Cannot drive more than an hour at a time, must get out and walk.  Has a bad wind whistle, don't like the constant shifting of the motor  and do not like the smart key.  This is our 3rd red Toyota we have owned. We really liked the first 2 but this 2016 is not good.  Can't wait to get rid of it.","100":"I bought my 2016 TRD off road about 6 months ago and it feels like the transmission shifts way to quick and it seems like the engine cuts out while the transmission is trying to figure out what gear it's supposed to be in, l'm not happy. The motor seems to be sluggish because of the way it shifts to soon and goes to 6th gear way to quick, so it's shifting all the time, hate that, I'm ready to get rid of it !!!!!","101":"Had this truck 30 days and a small chip from a passing regular size truck on the highway ran inches to either side in 2 hours, and much further by the end of the day.  highly frustrating.  Did not know to look for this trouble before buying, but this will be an expensive problem over the life of the car.  I would not have purchased if I know this.  there is an additional warranty they offer that supposedly would cover for a time, not worth it in the long run.  AND it really needs adjustable seats, particularly driver.  they have had much better technology for over a decade now, it dumbs down the vehicle not providing it for the price.","102":"I bought this car 5 months ago. It has a major transmission problem. Dealer could not fix it and offered to replace the transmission with a rebuilt transmission. I did not like that and called the Toyota and they escalated it to the manger to look into it but they will not put in a new transmission in my car. The case worker at Toyota is very polite but very bossy and keep saying I am sorry but that is your only option. I am currently looking for a lawyer to sue Toyota.","103":"Be sure to thouroughly test drive before committing. \nEngine has a very annoying buzzing, resonating vibration while accelerating or under load between 2100 and 2400 rpms. This seems to be a somewhat common problem mentioned here and other websites and forums. Toyota claims it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d.  It is literally driving me nuts and I\u2019m trading it in with 23K miles. Only saving grace is that re-sale is above average. Gas mileage is great but it is quite under powered. Don\u2019t plan on towing a big boat or camper with this unit.\nOverall quality such as fit and finish, materials used is good. Good firm but comfortable ride and handling.\nThis engine is just un-acceptable. Vehicle should have been field tested more before release to the market of a fundamental flaw like this. I will not return.","104":"remember this is a truck not a race car. take one to barrow alaska for the arctic challenge in a bone stock truck that is what reliability is all about. MADE IN AMERICA SAYS IT ALL. I WOULD PAY TWICE THE PRICE FOR AMERICAN. NO MEXICAN CHEVYS HERE PLEASE. [non-permissible content removed]","105":"at 14 200 km the top end of the engine was not getting enough oil I took the truck in and its been a on going battle to try and get it back they are telling me that they have to make the parts to fix my truck plus the back up screen had to be replaced this is the thrid tacoma I own in 2 years very upset with the way im being treat from toyota dont no if i will ever buy another again","106":"At the end of the day these trucks are amazing. They provide all of the quality an auto maker should and that's why Toyota is the best selling vehicle maker in the world. The products sell themselves!","107":"To set the record straight , I have owned 5 Tacomas. One was away back in the 70s , but the modern Tacomas were 2009 , 2012 ,2015, 2016. I found the first 3 to be all pretty much the same, except as the years progressed the electronics became better with each truck. The gas mileage on each truck was almost identical for the first 3 modern trucks combined 16.5 mpg. I never reached 20 mpgon any of them , city or highway. Thewinter months the mileage went down to 14-15 mph combined. I have owned 11  trucks in my life . Of them,6 American trucks , all needed to have work done under warranty( as much as $3000 worth ) . None of the Tacomas have needed anything done under warranty ( not counting a replacement for bad weather mats).    The 2016 is  great . A lot of people have criticized the engine for being sluggish and  the transmission constantly shifting. compared to the 2015 , that is true, but I have realizedthat my mileage is almost 25% better with the newer 3.5 engine and 6 speed transmission. I am getting and average combined mileage of 21mpg, reached an alltime high of 24.7 on a trip last week. If I want better performance I use the 6 speed manual shift and it feels like a sports car, but use the 6 speed automatic for mileage . I have noticed that the truck has plenty of get up and go when you jump on it going 65 mph and wanting to pass. it gets up to 85 very quickly.  As I mentioned before the electronics have developed as the models progressed. The JBL sound system in my Sport model is crazy good. Loud but clear.  The new backup alert has saved me several times from backing into someone or something. Same can be said for the alerts in the mirrors when  a car is beside you in your blind spot.  I love the style of the new truck and the beefy look it has . I get compliments all the time on the appearance of the truck. With all the combined factors , I think I have the best truck of all the Tacomas. Maybe I am just lucky with the mileage, but the rest of the features make it a pleasure to drive.","108":"Traded in our 2011 Tacoma in Sept\/16 at Diehl in Butler, Pa.....we were thrilled with trade in value. These trucks are built to last for sure! Our first service needed on our 2011 was at 136,000 miles for parking lights! Unbelievable! We had added running boards, rain visors and bed cover...such a good looking truck! We sell antiques and travel to shows for buying and selling so we use a 16 ft enclosed trailer. The truck always performed well for us. Now we just bought a 2017 Tacoma...added all the above but haven't decided on our bed cover yet. Love it already but still think our other (dark grey) was prettier than the new white one!","109":"I previously owned a 2006 Tundra that I bought new and drove 160,000 miles....basically trouble free.  I needed a new truck for a variety of reasons, but the Tundra had just gotten to \"big truck\" as it got older, so I focused on the Tacoma.  I searched and searched for just the truck I wanted and finally found it....two states away (seems Toyota is not too keen on selling customers what they want....just what Toyota wants to build at the moment).  But that is another story.  Also, I realize that the complaints below are based on my experience owning a Tundra, which was a MUCH better truck.  So as for the Tacoma, I get my truck, and my first trip is from Texas to Colorado for vacation.  On the road, I discovered the three BIG DOWNERS about the truck almost immediately.  The engine is very underpowered.......the transmission will drive you crazy with its constant downshifting just to get up a normal highway overpass, and the fuel economy is nowhere near what the manufacturer claims.  Don't plan on any quick passing on the freeway.  Won't happen.  This engine is just not right for this size vehicle......  And the transmission........wow, what a piece of crap.  Does a six-speed transmission really need to shift into THIRD just to get up an overpass??  I know this is really an engine\/transmission problem, but you would think a company like Toyota could have figured this out a long time ago.  Finally, this truck is supposed to get 20 MPG (I think) in the city.  I get 14 (I am not an aggressive driver).  I get 19 on the highway (driving the speed limit) and I think it is supposed to average 27 ?  I have had it serviced at the dealership, and they assure me everything is as it should be.  Really?? You should really be a died-in-the-wool Toyota fan to buy this truck.","110":"The 2016 Tacoma with the v6 is horrible when using cruise control.  When traveling 75mph or higher with cruise control on transmission does not want to shift out of 4th gear most of the time which results in poor fuel economy.  It will shift into 5th sometimes but usually stays in 4th gear.  I drove from Omaha, ne. to Denver Co. mostly in 4th gear because it would not shift into a higher gear, I got a whopping 14.6 miles to the gallon.  I can't believe I traded my 2015 Tacoma for a 2016 Tacoma.  I was told by a Toyota Service Mgr. that this truck needs a turbo charger because it lacks so much power.  I have called Toyota Corp.  I have had the truck in twice once in Denver and once in Omaha and was told this is how the truck is suppose to run.  I called Toyota Corp.  They were no help what so ever.  Toyota knows this drivetrain is terrible but will not do anything about it.","111":"The ride is amazing.. it's a rugged, classy, and great looking. I don't feel comfortable driving over 80 but I can use my BMW for that. Great around town and it laughs at pot holes so common in the NYC tri-state area.. Over 12K miles now and still runs like the day I bought it.","112":"I did not buy the vehicle in the end. I still think the TACOMA was\/is the right vehicle for me, but maybe not just now. I was offered too little ( in my opinion)  too late as a trade for my spotless low mileage 2013 Honda CRV  otherwise the deal would have happened. I had fancied a truck for some time as it would be better suited to my lifestyle, but was not REALLY sure I was doing the right thing getting rid of my Honda ( condition,mileage, fuel consumption - and, what you know ie no problems) to buy a new vehicle - truck or not. Due to the offered trade being quite a bit under what I felt it was worth I walked away. Phone calls and  discussions later increasing the trade offer was still a little below what I was prepared to take, and I had enough time to think clearly on what my Honda was really worth to me - and that was way more than offered and more even than I had initially been prepared to take. thus I say \"too little too late\". had a better trade been offered on the day, I probably would have taken it. having said this however, when I am again ready to buy I would go back to the same dealer as my treatment there was good and my experience overall was positive - I just hope they offer me what my  trade is really worth from the start and not push for the lowest price they can for it and cause  me to \"walk away \" again. I NEVER buy a vehicle without doing my homework and NEVER when \"desperate\" to do so I am always able to \"walk away\" and in todays tough times many are like me.","113":"My 2016 shifts up and down whenever it feels like it. Sometimes 2 gears at a time on a flat road with the cruise on and no wind. The 6 cylinder engine is a piece of crap teamed with a 6 speed tranny which the 5th and 6th gears not being used at speeds over 75. Had mine back to the shop 4 times and they said this is how they run. Well after owning 9 previous Tacoma's that isn't how the older ones run. I hooked it up to my boat and it couldn't get out of 3rd gear with my boat behind it.  I had to turn and unhook the boat and I drove right to my dealer and demanded my 2014 Tacoma back. The 2014 pulls the same small boat perfectly. I'm 5' 11\" and my head hits the sunroof constantly and I would be worried if I hit a big bump while driving the 2016. Beware and give it a nice long test drive if your interested in buying a new Tacoma, they have a ton of engine\/tranny problems. Just google 2016 Tacoma shifting problems and you can read 1000's of post about unhappy owners like myself.  Oh yeah, mileage on 8 fill ups was 12.5 to 13.4, no kidding. I probably had a big lemon, but Toyota Corp. told me this is how they run so I'll leave it up to you to decide. I've read enough posts to know there's MANY others just like me out there.","114":"We have owned our 2016 Toyota Tacoma for 2 months today, I parked truck in parking lot at work come out 3 hours later to go to lunch and my window was cracked shape of L,  there was no sign of anything hitting it called the dealership Thomasville Toyota and they told me nothing they can do, to call  our insurance company. Now I see I am not the first with this issue they need to recall and replace all windshields.","115":null,"116":"[1] Ride quality - it's not a crossover, don't compare the ride quality to one. My wife drives the MDX, and there is a significant difference in the ride quality when we swap vehicles. It's a little rough around the edges, but then I expected that from the truck. However, it is a very solid ride. [2] Power - it's sufficient. It's not fast nor is it meant to be a road racer. [3] Noise - this is where the truck suffers a bit. I haven't driven the previous generation Tacomas, but from what I've read Toyota has made significant improvements to dampen the cabin. However, it is not good enough to use the bluetooth to talk on the phone while driving. Also, the engine noise is a bit annoying, but nothing that drives me crazy. [4] Rear passenger space - my family members aren't very tall. We're actually quite short, so having 4 adults in the truck is not a problem. However, I can see taller adults having a bit of a difficult time finding a comfortable spot in the rear seats. It's not ideal for long road trips, especially in the back seats. [5] Gas - I am averaging 19 - 20 mpg in mixed driving. [6] Infotainment - The system is reliable and responsive and I have no complaints. [6] Tires - I have the TRD Off-Road trim and the OEM tires are ok, but I will not be replacing them with the same tires when these wear out. [Summary] The ratings that I gave for this truck was based on it's comparison to other mid-sized trucks. I think it would be unfair to compare the ride to a SUV as I wouldn't compare the ride of a Camry to a luxury sedan.\n\nUpdate 3\/2\/17: Having owned the vehicle for about half a year and using it as my daily driver, I still really enjoy driving the truck. The transmission issue that so many people complain about has been an issue for me, but the updates that Toyota are coming out with are helping. The truck starts off in overdrive mode and constantly wants to upshift, so you can either get in the habit of using ECT power or just give it a little more gas. The seats that many complain about isn't too much of an issue for me. However, for long distance trips (3+ hours), I definitely feel more fatigue. I listen to Pandora almost exclusively and while the Entune system is just fine when it works, sometimes it just has an issue establishing a connection with the vehicle. I don't know if it's my phone, the vehicle, or just the app itself, but it is a nuisance as I will experience this a few times a week.","117":"Tipical toyota, firm ride & steering, simple controls, solid feel, good storage . Navigation screen hard to see in bright light, transmission shifts out of lower gear to quickley.  Gas milage for a truck is good. Size of veh. is perfect, not to big or small.","118":"I finally decided to buy a truck but did quite of bit of research and test drives before I purchased on my 2016 Tacoma Sport Double cab. I read a lot of bad reviews about the transmission and pedal lag. Yeah its a little slow but overall I think it drives fine. The interior was nicer than the Chevy Colorado and Honda Ridgeline. I thought the Tacoma has the right balance of sport, interior quality and drive feel. I also drive a BMW 2016 M3. When I want to drive fast I drive my M3 but I do like the ride of the Tacoma. One grip I did have was not having enough models with leather seats. My has cloth but they are comfortable and appear easy to clean. Gas mileage has been fine. I feel like I made a good decision with the tacoma","119":"Great truck! Great drivability with excellent handling on and off road, which is quite a balance to strike! This is NOT a particularly high tech or fancy truck. For example Tacomas have never had power seats at ANY trim level. No Remote start, even as an option, by keychain or LTE via app, like competitors. I do feel like it should either have a little more torque and horsepower OR slightly better fuel economy, but not terrible. Having made those small gripes, I love this truck for dozens of other reasons! It is supremely capable off road and a joy to drive.","120":"Have had many issues with leaf springs squeaking toyota says they can't fix it. Three times been to dealer for this.  Rear differential was making a howling noise on freeway between 55 and 65 mph when feathering the accelerator pedal and ended up being replaced under warranty but now the replacement rear diff is making the same noise. Spent many hours at dealer and toyota tech flew out to look now they claim it's normal. Driveline vibrations noticed at 1800 to 2200rpms. Toyota claims this is normal too but never had this on any other vehicle I've owned. Toyota quality control going down the crapper. The fuel economy is no better than my old 2009 Tacoma yet they put a smaller motor and it performs terribly...it lacks low-end torque. Dealer applied software update to \"fix\" transmission shifting constantly but after about 1000 miles the tranny shifts like poorly again. I thought it would get better with mileage but it has only gotten worse. Would not buy again","121":"I was prepared to sell my 2005 TRD Tacoma for a new 2016 TRD Pre-runner Sport until I drove one.  The new engine is supposedly from a Lexus.  Gives Lexus a bad name.  Actually the engine is probably fine, but in the interest of CAFE mileage requirements Toyota has crushed the spirit of the previous model Tacoma.  The drivers seat bottom cushion isn't as long, sits flatter, seems thinner and harder, thereby offering far less thigh support, appearing as though the change was to reduce weight.  Push the pedal for rapid acceleration and you get a 25 yrs. ago bad case of turbo lag while the computer appears to be giving you time to decide whether you really want to jeopardize your attempt at breaking your previous mileage record.  In like kind, it is geared for mileage and therefore downshifts at the slightest throttle advance.  I like mileage, but this is a pickup truck.  There are way to defeat some of this, but then I'm pushing this 3.5L engine most of the time in an attempt to get what I got from my previous 4L version.  There are some nice techy items if you want your medium size truck to feel more like your, I don't know, Lexus.  When I asked whether Toyota was fixing some of this on the soon to be released 2017 I got the, \"Toyota puts a lot of engineering, money and thought into their designs and then sticks with them\".  Hmm, a tone of \"We'd agree with you if we weren't senior sales staff\".  So I bought the newest version of Tacoma similar to my 2005, a 2015, only to find that rather than have improved power and torque over 10 yrs. of refinement, my \"visually identical\" 4L engine now had 236 HP instead of 245 HP, and 266 ft.lb torque instead of 282 ft.lb, but perhaps 1-2 mpg improved mileage.  I'm for mileage, but many companies appear to have figured out how to achieve both.  I have not yet determined where the power and torque went other than likely remapping at Toyota, where they lock you out from youthful and less youthful free thoughts of tailoring your truck to fit your needs. Wait, for only $6,000 or a little more you can buy and install a supercharger from TRD for your 4L engine, which confirms that the engine can handle a lot more power.  Toyota appears to understand what a quality truck is, just not yet the true spirit of a truck owner\/driver.  At this point I remembered the rest of my conversation with the sales guys and former car leader Bob Lutz.  The days of our most satisfying autos are already behind us.  Just wait another few years as CAFE pushes the cars and truck to autonomous pods with no heart and soul.  As Bob Lutz said, the industry as we knew it will be dead and gone in 20 years (I say 15 yrs) and replaced with Uber-style, give me my tablet so I can order a ride.  But why?  That debated but likely true global warming thing is forcing us to protect the world from us and us from ourselves.  So, if you believe any of this, buy your last vehicle you're likely to enjoy very soon, some critical spare parts, and nurse it until you can longer remember where it was you wanted to go or how to get home from there.  Oh, and hope the gov't doesn't impart penalties to encourage you to turn it in to your local recycling plant.  Just had a vision of camo tarp covered,  lifted, 6.X L diesel rock crushers hidden in the forest.","122":"I love this truck. So much that I drove 225 miles to buy it for $1,800 less than any deal I could find locally. And the dealer was willing to go out of his way to trade for the exact truck available in the color combination and options that I wanted. This truck drives and performs even better than I expected. The aggressive styling of Tacoma's 4 door Access Cab are absolutely the top of the class","123":"Tacoma is the best mid-size truck going and it rides and drives much better than the 2005-2015! Fuel economy is much improved. My older  (2013) 4.0 L sucked the gas and the interior was uncomfortable. This truck feels like a Lexus! Pulls my Ranger Bass boat with ease and hits the trails in our hunting property with authority. The older truck is just that....older. The newer Atkinson Cycle motor is awesome! Handling is much improved. Buy the truck! You can believe this review, I've driven Tacomas since they were Hilux's!","124":"I traded in my 2010 Tacoma for the 2016 model year mainly for the improved gas mileage. The 2010 was 14 - 15 around town and 21 on the highway. I'm seeing 19.5 around town ang got 26.7 for a 2 hour highway trip at 65 mph. The 2016 is quieter, smoother and better handling. BTW I got 20 K for a trade in on my 2010 that I paid 26900 for so I'm expecting this 2016 to also hold its value extremely well.","125":"The 2016 Tacoma will disappoint anyone that has owned an older V6 powered Tacoma.  I have purchased a new Tacoma every 2 years since 1985.  I currently still own 4 TRD 4x4s. They are all used for business.  The 2016 has the worst engine, transmission, gear ratio of any Toyota I have driven.  The power band\/shift points leave this vehicle sluggish at best.  On any incline in the road the transmission will shift continuously between 6th and 4th(1900rpm to 3400rpm at 75mph).  The engine noise is significantly more noticeable than my 2014 which is a great vehicle. On flat ground the transmission shifts through the gears so quickly you find yourself always stepping harder on the throttle to keep the speed up. When you contact Toyota everyone at the dealership will deny they have heard of the problem.  Toyota factory reps will admit they know of the issue but as of this date no fix.  I would not recommend a 2016.  Look for a 2014 or older.","126":"People on here have been whining about the shifting but honestly, it's a Tacoma...not a race truck.  It takes a little getting used to but once you settle into it and learn how it shifts, it's not hard to adapt your driving style a little to take advantage of it.  I love the design inside and out, everything feels solid and it's everything you expect from a Tacoma.  I am 6'1 and once I got the seat\/steering wheel adjusted, it's a comfy ride and it's very easy to drive.  I haven't had much cargo to haul yet so I don't have a lot to say there except that I love the adjustable cargo locks, those are VERY handy to have.","127":"Take it from someone who has owned Toyota trucks since the mid 80's, the 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off Road is the \"WORST\" truck I've ever owned.  If I had it to do over, I would not have bought this truck.  I wish I would have read the reviews from previous buyers before assuming this was going to be another Toyota quality vehicle and that was not the case.  If you are reading this post \"before\" you purchase this truck, I would advise you to 1st, not buy this truck.  But, if you are interested in buying this truck I would recommend you to \"test drive\" the truck a lot before buying it.  Even if you have to go to several different dealerships. I don't even have 2,500 miles on my truck & planning on selling or trading it before the first 5,000 mile service. I have never been more disappointed in the truck and in the lack of help from the dealership that I bought it from.  The only people that could honestly give this truck a 5 Star Review, would be the salesmen. Had two  firmware updates since posting , Toyota still working on transmission and other issues.","128":"Bought mine in oct 2015 and complained about the transmission erratic shifting after a couple days of driving it. After getting the run around from the dealership I called Toyota Customer service. I was told the transmission is working exactly the way it was designed to work. Now I drive a F-150. I have been leasing Taco's for 12 years and 2016 is the worst vehicle I have ever drove. There is nothing good to say about this truck. The engine is weak and sounds like a sewing machine. The transmission is horrific. The seats are so low you might as well sit on the floor. The sunroof rattled and leaked. The bed cover didn't seal and leaked. Entune is worthless, I tell it \"go home\" and it sends me to IHOP. No power seat, no power rear sliding window, key needed to lock tailgate. Paint scratches when you look at it. Cheap lame fabric on the dash. Horrible on gas, 16 MPG's. Don't buy this over priced lemon.","129":"This is my 2nd Tacoma. We purchased the Tacoma S Access cab w\/4cld. My last Tacoma was an '08 work truck reg cab. Although our new Tacoma is the base truck it comes with many good features standard. We really like how it steers, rides and seems roomy to us. I've heard people complain about the low seats and no pwr seats but this doesn't seem like a problem to us. I'm 5''9 and she is 5''2. Truck sits high so I added the 5'' round, alum. step rails for her. My truck came with all season fitted mats and a pin stripe, (not on the invoice). This truck is bigger than the old one and I worried about the 4 not having enough power? I drove it on the Interstate and up the mountain (I-40) to Asheville. I think the 6 speed transmision and ect button makes a difference. It won't snap your head back and younger people might want to feel more power from a 6cyl. Also, I must tell you I'm not towing or hauling any thing. One complaint on the base model which seems strange to me is no intermittent wipers and no key entrance on the passenger side. Odd, as the truck has so many other good features standard. I could do without the camera mount on the inside of the windshield as I'm not off roading this truck. Like the interior. Eight air bags, six speakers, good storage. Instrumentation simple and well placed. The materials used seem good quality. The doors seem solid and the paint and exterior fit is good. Everything works and I've not had any squeaks, rattles or anything I've had to take it back to the dealer for repair. I've already had a number of favorable comments from others. As I may have stated, We're older(68) and pretty easy on a vehicle. As our second vehicle, I feel we were placed in the correct truck for us. P.S. we garage our vehicles so if you do too, you might want to take it home to see if it fits in the garage. All in all, we're very happy with our truck.","130":"I was so happy to get my new truck and i love everything about the truck except the transmission. I literally cannot go 45mph. When i hit that speed the truck shifts into a gear that bogs the engine down to 1000rpm and then it downshifts when i try to keep the truck at 45mph so it jumps me past that speed. I can't keep a steady speed unless I'm on the highway in the top gear. I had the TSB done to fix the hesitation going from P to D and it worked. I had the transmission fluid checked. I did everything that corporate toyota told me to do and it still bogs down driving down the street and continually shifts. The fix is already in the truck but they won't perform it. If you put the truck in ECT PWR mode then it runs great. If they take that program and make it the startup program then it would be fine. For now I'm going to have to trade it in and get something else. It sucks because i like toyota or at least i used to.","131":"Toyota please please please change your shift points for the transmission to be above 1000rpm. The 3.5l engine does not have enough torque to be smooth at that rpm. If you sneeze while in gear at 1000rpm it will downshift. ECT power mode is great which changes the transmission to the correct shift points but you have to turn that on every time you start the vehicle. I don't want to be one of those haters who just says the transmission sucks because I don't believe that. I just think the ECU programming for the trans shift points if off of what it should be. My recommendation is to put out a TSB that gives people the option to bring it in if they want to perform the transmission shift point change or not. Very close to being a perfect truck but not quite yet or at least until we see that TSB come out.","132":"I love everything about this truck except for the fuel consumption. I feel in this day and age Toyota could have squeeze a couple more miles out of each gallon of fuel used.  Having said that, there's no other truck out there that I could place my trust in like I do in the Tacoma.","133":"I had my previous truck, a Ford, for 13 years.  When it comes out of the shop, it goes to my in-laws.  I loved that truck.  So after test driving several brands and deciding on the Tacoma Double Cab TRD 4x4, made the purchase.  This is the first month of driving, but I have been through the truck inside and out, read through all the manuals, checked out every control and taken the truck on the highway, in the city and off road.  My overall reaction is pleasantly surprised but not fanatically enthusiastic.  This may change in time as I am still used to my old truck and waiting to find out how the Tacoma endures the next 10-13 years with me!  My main concern is long-term reliability of the components, especially the plastic fascia trim on the front and rear.  I am an old-school guy who likes metal bumpers and metal components that don't flex when you push or pull on them.  I am certain I can put my fist through the plastic front grill, but at least the radiator and engine block are a good 12\" behind that flimsy front.  Off road, the Tacoma handles much better than any other 4x4 I have owed and is much more capable.  Soggy embankments and ditches covered in rain-fresh 3 foot field grass weren't a problem. No bottoming or spinning.  One related issue, I still haven't been able to engage the 'crawl control' even though I am following the manual.  The Atkinson engine and paired transmission are another area of concern.  At no load and on cruise control at 77 mph over flat to rolling 50 foot elevation changes the engine and transmission occasionally seeks for the optimum rpm and gear ratio.  This V6 seems to lack some punch.  Out of the four V6 vehicles I have owned, I would rank it at #2 for engine.  For off-road #1.  I have the trailering package and plan to pull about 2000 pounds next week so that will give me a little more feedback on the engine and tranny.  My wife is more tech savvy than me and she is thrilled when driving the new Tacoma.  She has paired her iPhone with the Entune audio system so that text messages are spoken to her.  Yes, she now thinks this is her truck, (sigh.)  Most of my hesitation on giving the Tacoma a five stars thumbs-up all around is based on longevity.  If it holds up as well as my wife's decade old Prius, I will be satisfied.","134":"I have owned both a 1st and 2nd generation Tacoma and Toyota has saved the best for last! As the proud owner of a new TRD Off Road DC SB, I cN honestly say this is my fav vehicle I've ever owned. Not only does it look sexy in Magnetic Grey, but the ride is also awesome for daily commuting (20.4 mpg avg.) Slight mods coming soon are tint, toneuu cover, side steps, and blackout grill. Buy one! You will not regret it.","135":"Gas pedal buzzes\/vibrates on acceleration through most RPMS. During extended acceleration periods, vibration can cause numbness in the foot. Like others have said, it requires you to shift position, use cruise control, and shift gears to get out of the main vibration range. Toyota continues to receive complaints about this issue, but keeps denying that this is even a problem to begin with. I have never experienced this issue on any other car, no matter how old or beat up the vehicle was.","136":"OK, I love the truck, handling, features, engine, wish it were a bit smaller actually(like the older models), but because of the size it does tow things well.  I HATE my automatic transmission.  Perhaps from the engineers point of view it is supposed to downshift two gears and rev up to 3000 rpm, but as an operator who has driven mostly manual trannies this is mentally exhausting.  I would be happy if there was a way to put it in 6th or 5th or even 4th if you need that, and make it stay there.  Just like a manual transmission.  Let the engine pull a little.  If I am stupid enough to let it pull too much that's my problem.  I live in an area with small gentle hills and the constant shifting is insane.  Also the locking torque converter decouples too quickly.  Now perhaps with the new Atkinson Cycle engine it can't handle loads as efficiently so it bumps the rpm,idk.  But it's annoying.      I would recommend an automatic transmission similar to what Hyundai uses.  In the manual mode if you have it in 6th gear it will stay in that gear until the vehicles slows below 40 mph, then downshifts to 5th. It does this in all gears until you come to a stop.  Then it is in 1st.  As you accelerate you have to do your own shifting.  But on small hills it will hold it's gear or you can make the decision to downshift and normally the torque converter doesn't decouple either.  It acts as if it is a manual transmission.      So why didn't I just get the manual?  Because the final gear ratios are not as good.  If the manual had the same overall ratios I would have stayed with that.  As to why they gear them that way I don't know.  This thing has plenty of power so it can't be that.  Maybe they don't think Americans can shift or handle a clutch very well.  A manual should be more efficient in both power and economy but because of the ratios it is not as good in highway mpg.   HATE THIS TRANSMISSION!!!!!!!!!!NOT HAPPY\n\nUpdate 1-30-17  Put some Goodyear \"FierceAttitude 265\/75\/16 on it.  Rides a little stiff and noisier but not as bad as I expected.  Awesome in the snow.  Love the 4 wheel drive and the limited slip rear end.  Some people are complaining about not enough power.  I disagree.  With this new Atkinson cycle engine the power is there but at a higher rpm.  Not real happy with the gas mileage.  Used to have an '86 4-Runner and it would get 24-27 .  Just can't do that with this bigger vehicle.  I still DO NOT like the Auto Tran.  The other day it shifted 17 times accelerating up to 65 mph up a small incline\/hill.....REALLY?  I would LOVE to be able to manually control my gears.  Get rid of the S-mode and make it a manual override.  Maybe if you are racing the S mode is important....Maybe.  But for a working type truck it is truly worthless IMO.  I want economy and I want power  when I want it not when the Tranny senses something.  Tranny can't see the hills and doesn't know what my brain is anticipating.  Hope that helps guys","137":"I regret buying this truck... there are no real improvements in this truck compared to my 2005 Taco. I bought it on a whim. The cabin materials keep getting cheaper in quality. The steering  will fatigue you after a while. It still has the drum brakes on back. The engine is  now a 3.5 ltr vs a 4.0 from previous years therefore the engine revs higher to make power. Getting my old truck back.","138":"I bought the 2016 Tacoma and I'm satisfied with the truck but not very happy with it. All things consider, the truck is probably still the best midsize truck, simply because the reliability, handling and \"truck feeling\" outperforms the rest.  However the two weakest points of the truck are the under performance in fuel Economy and the terrible, unfriendly and BAD entune system. If you are the type of guy who is into technology and want his phone to work well and integrate Ina modern way, you will HATE THIS SYSTEM. I cannot understand how Toyota decided to not use Apple CarPlay and android in-car system. Instead they use this in-house version of a system that looks and feels like it belongs with the 2010 model.  Some times I wish I should trade in for another brand just because of the frustration it causes.  s","139":"The 2016 holds fast to the concept of a true pick up truck.  You want to take your truck into the mountains?  This is it.  Do you want to drive up and down the city streets with air conditioned seats? Hard pass. This is an active persons truck!  It's purpose built.... The purpose? Adventure.  No it's not the fastest, no it's not the most powerful but don't be fooled, this truck can hold its own on road. Off road and you're in rare company with a Wrangler...","140":"Bought this 'full redesign' '16 Tacoma Ltd 4x4 in September of 2015 after my friend, a fleet manager at a Toyota dealership, told me how great it was going to be.  We had a 5 year old FJ Cruiser and, although we loved it, we needed a truck and the full size would not fit in out garage.  I 'liked' the G2 Tacoma; however, felt it was somewhat outdated and was impressed by what Toyota was doing by supposedly changing much about the truck, including the engine and trans.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in both the truck and in Toyota Customer Service, and my dealer.  Soon after buying, I took the truck on two long trips and found out that a buzzy vibration in the steering wheel, floorboard area, and gas pedal at 2100-2400 RPMs, put my hands and lower arms, up to my elbow, to sleep, which I felt was a major safety problem.  I reported this to my dealer, and the mechanic said he felt it but that there was nothing they could do at this point.  I complained directly to Toyota, who had me bring them the truck for two engineers to check it out.  They felt the vibration; however, when I got the letter from Toyota, it said that \"the steering functions as designed\" and the investigation was closed.  When I reported back to my dealer (from whom I've purchased numerous vehicles, including referring many sales to them, too) they just shrugged and said that unless Toyota comes up with a fix, there was nothing they could do for me (on a $41K+ truck, no less!).  Besides the vibration issue, there was a problem with the new engine and trans combo.  Shifting on the new A\/T was horrible and the engine had to be pushed to get any performance out of it at all, kind of like an old 2 stroke engine that needed high revs to get into a power band.  Cruise control would downshift quickly, then never upshift at all unless you tapped on the gas, making it useless.  All of my comments were met with :  'Functions as designed'.  I could never get even 20mpg out of the vehicle, even on the highway.  My FJ Cruiser was a much better vehicle, smooth, quieter, shifted easily, more comfortable, and regularly got me 21-22mpg on the highway at speed.  I regretted trading it in for this much inferior truck, and wish I would have just bought a Gen 2.  After fighting with both Toyota and my dealership for 9 months (and being relegated to just using the truck for local driving due to the buzziness), my wife and I just traded it in for a different truck, one that doesn't buzz, is more comfortable, handles better, and gets good mileage.  I hated having to take a several thousand dollar loss on a new purchase like this; however, IMO, this 'upgrade' was a total failure on Toyota's part.  A month later, I'm glad I got rid of it.  Never thought I'd ever say this about a Toyota.....but it appears to me that these are selling on the fine reputation of the G2.  I would stay away until Toyota can figure this one out and get it fixed.  (Note:  a master mechanic with 30+ years experience at the dealership pointed out that the 3.5 came from Lexus; however, thinks the problem is the Taco used hard rubber engine mounts and the Lexus uses hydraulically controlled oil-filled mounts.  He also noted that the Taco has a single exhaust header piece and the Lexus uses a multi-piece system.  This is where he felt the issue with the vibes was.  He also pointed out that the trans was \"over-programmed to get you better mileage, and a re-programming would fix that issue.\"  When I asked him about any pipeline fixes, he responded that Toyota has been 'hinting' at them for over 6 months; however, nothing had yet been done.  He thinks that as long as the truck sells well, they won't do a thing. )   This truck does have potential; however, it is just not ready for prime time.  Buyer, beware.","141":"I just got this truck and only has 1500 miles on it. I like the interior and technology. I actually like everything about the truck except engine\/transmission combo. The engine is pretty good in ECT mode but the problem is you have to hit that button every time you start it. The transmission is by far the worst i have driven in the 24 vehicles i have owned. I am cruising at 55mph on flat ground and the truck is shifting up and down at a steady speed as it doesn't know what gear it's supposed to be in. Completely takes away the enjoyment in driving it. In the last 15 years i have only bought toyota's as i can't believe i am saying this, this will be my last one for awhile and I'm going to open a case with Toyota to try and get my money back. Its really too bad cause i really wanted to like this truck since i spent the money on it. The good thing is i only make mistakes once.","142":"Best Toyota Tacoma Yet.","143":"The biggest problem with this vehicle is the lack of power seats.  The manual seats do not adjust up or down so many will have to buy a cushion to see over the elevated hood.  Acceleration is mediocre and needs performance enhancers.   Not real agile on the road compared to the 2010 Nissan Frontier that I regretfully traded in.","144":"Before purchasing this truck I also seriously considered the Colorado and Canyon. Those trucks have smoother rides and maybe a little more on demand power than the Tacoma. But, those are the only areas where they might be better. The Tacoma has features that the others don't even offer, including far better technology (amazing on the Tacoma), sun\/moon roof (a must for me as a former convertible owner), far more exciting interior materials and layout, and a really fun ride. The Tacoma also has great storage compartments in the bed of the truck, and the limited comes with the tonneau cover. Put all of this together and I don't know why anyone would buy any other truck in this class. This is a great truck. The only real downside, as far as I'm concerned is that it could have more \"umph\" when you step on the gas, but the \"ect\" button really gives this a boost, and if you truly do \"step on the gas,\" it gives you all you ask for. But, you have to step on it a bit more than on other vehicles. Once you get used to this, you have an amazing truck that promises a lot of fun and utility for a long time to come. And the looks! Nothing else compares. I love this truck!","145":"A few weeks ago I wrote the review \"Be Careful and Test Drive\". Since then I towed a 5X8 UHaul trailer from Florida to Ohio - approx. 1100 miles. I simply wanted to report that the average mpg dropped from my normal average 20 mpg without towing a trailer to 15.3 mpg with towing the trailer which was full. Quite a drop in mpg evidencing once again the \"lugging\" problem that I and others have reported. Hopefully Toyota will come out with a fix caused  by the engine\/transmission defaulting to 6th gear and 1100 RPM.  I could barely get up the hills\/mountains on I-77 through Virginia and West Virginia without manually shifting. Even my salesman in Colorado where I purchased the vehicle said \"this vehicle is not suitable for the Colorado mountains\". I should have listened to him.","146":"Transmission and Engine combo feels very weak. It shifts erratically. It will downshift when coasting through the neighborhood at random. It will not hold 6th gear with even the slightest hill or head wind. The transmission will shift flare from 2nd to 3rd gear often when cold. The transmission also has a slipping sensation from time to time. The engine feels weak with this transmission. You have to floor it to get power out of it. The fuel economy is about the same as previous generation Tacomas at about 18.9 MPG....really not a major improvement when considering the step down in performance with this new trans and motor. The rear leaf springs squeak like crazy at only 10,000 miles and have been to the dealer three times for it. I also have a case with Toyota Corporate they are saying there is no fix for it and to live with it. It is embarrassing to drive through a parking lot and people look at your brand new nearly $40K truck because it squeaks like a rusty box-spring mattress. There is a noticeable vibration at highway speeds felt in the Steering wheel and in the gas pedal, if you let off the gas it goes away but if you apply gas it vibrates\/buzzes. It is very annoying and almost makes my hands numb while driving. The rumor is that this is a Design oversight\/glitch that Toyota dropped the ball on. I drove another brand new 2016 Tacoma and it exhibited the same traits. Finally the rear differential was making a howling noise at 50 to 60 mph if you are feathering the throttle or lightly applying throttle on a downhill stretch of freeway. I took it to the dealer and they said it was not normal so they kept my truck for 3 days and replaced the entire rear differential already, with less than 12K miles on it. I couldn't believe it. Now not even 300 miles later I hear the noise coming back again in the rear differential. I would have a hard time recommending the 2016 Tacoma to anyone. It seems like Toyota Quality Assurance has really dropped the ball and Corporate is slow to release any information or resolutions for these issues. Driveline vibration has been an issues for years past on previous generation Tacomas as well so this is very troubling.","147":"I have owned this truck for 8 months I find that the overall construction is excellent, styling is great. The main concerns I have is that I got the 4- cylinder and it is under-powered for this truck,even with the 5-speed manual transmission.The other thing is the squeaky clutch pedal. I would buy another Tacoma in the future and would still get the SR or SR5 but with the 6-cylinder and 6-speed manual transmission.","148":"I love this truck. It definitely feels like a truck. It has way more features than are available on the competition. It is loads of fun to drive. I highly recommend it.","149":"Love the quality and the look of this truck,  both logical interior design and the beautiful exterior .","150":"Love the truck, just needed more room. The 4 door is in the works.","151":null,"152":null,"153":"Truck is solidly built. No rattles or squeaks, good audio, comfortable and quiet at highway speeds. However, the engine lacks low- end torque and this issue is exacerbated by very poor software mapping for the transmission. In an apparent effort to improve mileage, the transmission shifts quickly to keep the RPMs low as a result, the engine is always out of its powerband, making it feel even more sluggish. You can overcome this annoyance to some degree by putting it in Sport mode, or selecting the ECT mode. But you shouldn't have to do this. It drives like a slug unless you're very aggressive on the throttle. At highway speeds, the transmission is always hunting for the right gear. The engine is very noisy at all speeds. This is apparently normal and is due to its injectors and Atkinson Cycle function. It sounds like a diesel with 500k miles on it. Very annoying and disappointing for a truck this expensive.","154":"Let me start off this review by saying that I have never owned a Tacoma before or a truck. Also I have had my Tacoma for about 10 weeks now. I felt it was necessary to write a review to defend this truck. This is a great truck and I would recommend it, but lease it till they work out the bugs. First off, I'll start off with one of probably the most important questions, the mpg. I average around 20 mpg, doing about 60% city, 40% highway. If you do a lot of highway driving, my mpg meter has gone as high as 26mpg, as long as you don't drive like a jerk, you should get decent mileage. But when you buy a truck you're not buying it for the mpg, you buy it for versatility, otherwise go buy a Prius. Moving onto performance and ride quality. In terms of performance, I will admit acceleration can be a bit sluggish, especially when you need it. However, I find that if you turn the ect pwr button on or put it in sport mode, that does seem to loosen up the transmission a bit for better acceleration. It's no race car, but it still has ample passing power. In terms of ride quality, it's relatively smooth, but when going over bumps it gets pretty rough, so ride quality is so-so. And to add to that steering is pretty responsive. In terms of the interior, I love it, it's very simplistic but very nice and clean layout. I have cloth seats and they're very comfy, and the infotainment center's touchscreen is very responsive and user friendly. In terms of sound system, I had heard Toyota speakers were garbage, but to be honest they're actually pretty decent. Certain genres of music can be on the quieter side and require you to really crank it up. But overall, for the non-jbl's they still have pretty decent bass. Last but not least, I'd just like to add that, the backup camera makes parking the Tacoma even easier, as it's nimble size makes it easier to get through tight spaces. The design is definitely a big improvement in my opinion. Overall I give it 4 stars, it's a great truck, but still has its short comings, hopefully when my lease is up they'll make more improvements on the little things. Hope this review helped any future buyers!","155":"We love our Tacoma.  Perfect for my wife to drive and park, good mileage for a 4x4 and plenty of power and room.","156":"leased this 2016 toyota tacoma v6, 4 door back in march , toyota had a great affordable deal on this model that the average working man could afford for a toyota truck.first things first the exterior paint is horrible scratches with the slighest touch, first noticed it when i was cleaning a little bird poop off the hood with water and a soft cloth i couldnt believe my eyes there where i just cleaned now had a circular scratch, i cleaned it again and nothing still there . as i looked closer around vehicle there were many similar scratches, when i picked up vehicle they must hide the scratches when they detail it, but when you do your first wash low and behold they reappear.brought it back to dealer they were very good about this situation and detailed it again, so far so good.now the biggest con for this vehicle is the transmission it shifts constantly for what reason i have no idea, after it goes through all the speed shifts its fine then the slighest acceleration it shifts , and shifts ,and shifts and the road isnt even in any kind of incline, i have a 2015 rav 4 that my wife uses with a 4 cyl that rides smooth shifts only when it should, and performs better then my tacoma, i asked her if we could switch vehicles she laughed and said you wanted that truck now live with it. bottom line i do not recommend the tacoma to any one,look into another truck you\"ll be glad you did, and for me im stuck with it until the lease is up and when i do return it i feel sorry for the poor sap who purchases it.","157":"Cannot wait to get rid of this 2016 Tacoma when the lease expires. What a dog. New updates - 1. mileage dropped to 10 mpg when towing; 2. NAV screen goes black at least 1x per day and resets itself; and 3. wind howling noise driver side front window. And off course still the same old lack of responsiveness of the engine-- normally runs at less than 2000 rpm and you have to push accelerator pedal more than 1\/2 down before it responds creating a very dangerous condition in traffic. C'mon man.","158":"Really really poor quality for a Toyota product as I have owned or driven them for large parts of my life. So lets start with the exterior. Very crappy paint, as it is very easy to scratch, have a new scratch just from my summer coat sleeve, and one from just leaning my fishing pole against the side for a second to close the tailgate, in some ways its almost like it didn't get a clear coat. The metal exterior shell is flimsy and the doors sound hallow when you close them, and just seem extremely cheap construction.  So on to the interior: From the start the heating\/AC system made a really high pitched almost squealing sound for the first 5-7 minutes each time you start using it then would go away. During the first heavy rain the Truck started leaking water into the passenger side thru the passenger handle which has an airbag in it, after inspection at least 1 seem on that side of the vehicle was not welded at the factory. Which the dealer said will take a bit of time to fix and would need to keep the truck. Which want to then charge me for the rental for a MFG defect. This is all in the first just over 3 months of owning the new Tacoma. I would not recommend it to anyone until they 1 upgrade the crappy materials and construction to include a better quality control system at factory. Though I do like the new overall look and additions both inside and out of the 2016 Tacoma, the quality is completely void in this years model.","159":"It is in my opini\u00f3n the Best med size pick up ,i own a 2001 tacoma ,and just purchased the 2016 trd so far i l\u00edke everything about it","160":"Last summer, l Traded a 2016 Tacoma  Limited for a Ford F-150 Lariat. What a mistake! After dealing with the sickening floaty bouncy ride, I took the loss and purchased another 2016 Taco ltd. Thanks to Toyota for resale value... Ford resale very bad. Taco not being perfect, is a very fun vehicle to drive... handling and ride on the highway is quite good.","161":"First off, ive owned a 1986, 2001,2009, 2013. The 2001 was the best Tacoma by far. I test drove 4 different versions of the 16. The  6 cyl auto being the worst. It shifts like a 4 cyl. And that is no exaggeration. My 2013 although it sucks on gas miliage shifts like a dream. Smooth with no high rpm. The 2016 is nothing more then a half harted attempt at a \"new\" redesigned tacoma. The interior is ok. Nothing to get all gushing over. The ride isnt that great. Still alot of wind noise compaired to my 01. And there was a damn vibration comming up through the floor into the gas pedal. It was like my foot had fallen asleep.  I really wanted to like this new truck but I just cant. They have even taken away the fold down front seat that was great for setting my french fries on. Its the little things. I hate how the camera now sticks out near the tailgate release where as before it was hidden. Mud flaps are extra. But beyond the asthetics and the body style seeming dated to me,Just my opinion, the enging performance I rate as poor.  You can do better Toyota.  I hope this verson doesnt stick around long. At the rate toyota is going the tacoma will be just as big as the tundra soon.","162":"The Pros:  Great looking truck; comfortable ride; good navigation; good electronics; good gas mileage; great long term resale value; good choice for those who don't care;  The Cons:  Horrible fit and finish; windows rattle in the down position; horrible engine\/transmission combination - this truck has no low end torque and it's geared for gas mileage nothing else; even with the \"turbo\" button it goes from weird to weirder; I hated the engine and trans so much I got rid of my truck already after 7 months and 8000 miles.  traded for $30k.  I lost some money but could have been worse.  I just couldn't handle it any more.   The truck is a step up in technology but a definite step back in fit and finish and drivetrain.  Also, truck had weird whistle noise at highway speeds which the dealer could not rectify. That alone was the icing on the cake.  Toyota didn't do it's homework with this one.  I bought a Nissan Murano instead.  I'll miss my truck but not the issues.  Overall gas mileage was 18 city and maybe 21 on highway at 75 mph.  So not bad but not as advertised either.","163":"Bought a short bed double cab Sport 4x4 Tacoma as surprise gift for husband's 60th birthday two weeks ago. White. All the bells and whistles. Was he ever surprised, and he loves it!! We had looked at every pickup manufacturer on the lots and Toyota still rocks it best. Mud flaps should come standard but I added them the next week. Also added leather at purchase. Only thing I've noticed is that I wish there was a little more front seat leg room for the passenger. And the nav system needs to be reprogrammed at the dealership: \"Home\" currently can't be set up. Also wish the XM stations, once preset, would display what the channel is, not juat the channel number. The hunting for gears thing referenced in other reviews has not occurred with us, but it's mostly flat here or light hills. 700 miles and counting.","164":"I am writing this review to help identify problems for future buyers of 2016 Tacoma's. I purchased a 2016 Double cab 4 door Limited , listing for over $40,000.00 , and I am having problems with the motor noise, accelerating ,  and lack of power . The truck sounds like a sewing machine running, and accelerating in traffic is a real problem. I am afraid to try and get on the freeway because the lack of power almost gets me ran over. I paid more for the Limited Addition, and I feel Toyota should be responsible for getting rid of the above mentioned problems . I forgot to mention the transmission shifting is very rough, and not smooth . I am also hearing outside exhaust noise in the cab ( Not quiet at all , like a new truck should be . ) What has gone wrong with Toyota, I traded a 2005 Tacoma in for this truck, and the 2005 was better the day  I traded it in on this vehicle, than this 2016 truck will ever be. I have just 3000 miles on the new truck, but I feel the problems will be passed over, as I have heard others having the same problems, and dealers telling them -\"That's just normal for this truck \" but I know better. I have not taken my truck to the dealer yet for repairs, as I have only had it for appx. 3 months. I know other 2016 Tacoma owners that have been to dealers with their trucks, and been told --\" You just have to live with the problem, there's nothing wrong. I am considering selling this new truck that I have had only 3 months, and that is pitiful. I hope Toyota sees this review, and responds , as I  would seriously like to talk to someone about the above mentioned problems","165":"Truck has great performance if you drive with ETC activated, does not get the MPG's as advertised averages; averaging 15 MPG around town. Has already been to the service department for an annoying chirping sound cuased by the engine mounted high pressure fuel pump; replaced the pump and have same issue, which toyota says is a normal characteristic of the vehicle. Premium technolgy package with JBL is worth the cost. My overall impression of the truck is not good the steering feels vauge on center and is unresopnisive; toyota should have applied the tundra's handling characteristics to the tacoma and it would be a home run. Overall i am not satisfied with a $37000 overpriced truck which drives and machanichly sounds like a cheap dodge caravan minivan squeeking and chirping down the road. Toyota should be ashamed of itself giving us this vehicle branded as a home run.","166":"I was in the market for a mid-size truck to hand down to my teenage son in a few years.  I looked at the Tacoma...looks cool...drives like a tank.  Then there was the Colorado\/Canyon...nice trucks...don't really care for the looks and the interior is cramped and cheap looking.  I didn't even consider the Frontier.  Then I test drove a Ridgeline and that was it!  Comfortable, quiet, smooth riding and handles great!  The more I drive it, the more I like it.  I only have a few complaints...as many have stated before, the rear doors do not open wide enough and you do feel a little engine breaking under deceleration.  It's faint but I do notice it.  The only quality issue I've experienced so far is one of the sun visor clips is loose.  I gonna have to bring it in to get it fixed.    I've added Husky mats front and rear and the cargo net for the bed.  My son may have to wait a while for this one.","167":"You will love ride bcauset it feels like a suv in a truck","168":"Handling and ride quality are outstanding.  Three separate climate controls keep everyone comfortable.  Has all of the features I needed plus some delighters that I did not expect at this price point.  Advanced AWD has completion beat hands down.  Huge lockable trunk keeps valuables safe, dry and out of sight.  In mixed driving I am averaging 25 MPG which is far better than I expected.  The only negative is rear visibility, but there is a high resolution backup camera with 3 different view modes which addresses that shortcoming.  I  also considered a F150, but it was $6K more expensive for a comparably equipped model.  I also ruled out Tacoma due to dated technology and poor reliability according to Consumer Reports.","169":"I just got my new Ridgeline and I love it.  I had to wait a long while to get an RTLE-E because having a opening back window was a \"deal breaker\" for me.  Two things Honda engineers really missed.  1)  All models should come with an opening back window (it doesn't need to be power).  2)  The tonneau cover is really superior---but Honda does not have a locking tailgate.  Why is  totally beyond me!","170":"Bought the RTL-E top line model mostly for the tech features. Hard to find in exterior\/interior color combination I wanted for reasonable price, but can be done with patience and negotiation. Replaced a 2004 Honda Element at 120K miles.  The major selling point after a test drive was the ride quality and quietness. VERY carlike. Rides as well as my 2010 Acura MDX and 2013 Chrysler 200 hardtop convertible and a little better than our 2015 Nissan Murano Platinum. Great compromise between a SUV and a full-size pickup truck for light to moderate duty. 3 months and 1500 miles later, I'm very happy with the Ridgeline. My wife is loving it and me for her truck.","171":"I am a Honda person and have had at least ten of them from the original Civic through a 2015 CRV. Honda makes great cars, but the Ridgeline is not a truck for anyone who needs a durable rugged truck for serious truck work. Below is what I think about the RTL I owned: My Ridgeline RTL  interior was cramped especially around the driving pedals -- the parking brake pedal interferes with foot and leg movement. Try stretching your leg all the way out...tall guys can't do it. The tailgate does not have a lock--good for thieves to steal -- yes this does happen.\nGround Clearance is awful -- 7 and a half inches. Several times when I pulled into parking slots the front end scraped on the cement parking barrier. So much for any off road fun. Spare tire is a donut and not really good for any off road areas. \nOption packages do not include an XM radio until you are in the RTL-T price range of $35,860. This is ludicrous, as the \"lower\" priced models of $30,000 to $34,000 don't have a decent entertainment system. Any vehicle that is priced over $30K should at least have an XM radio. Also who really needs speakers in the truck bed?? \n\t\t\n\t\tTowing capacity is very weak. Yes the RTL has a tow bar, but that is all.  The RTL does not have an oil cooler or ATF cooler and did not come with a pigtail. The Pigtail is an extra $400 and there is no after market add ons for the oil or ATF coolers.  An oil cooler and ATF cooler is not available unless you buy the $39,000 all wheel drive version. Yes this is true.\n\t\t\n\t\tBottom Line: This \"truck\" is not a working truck. It is for people who like the image of driving a truck, but don't need the utility of hauling or going to off road areas. I would call this a Sport Utility Truck, as it is just another Pilot or but without the covered luggage area. Yes I owned a 2003 Pilot and it was better in all respects to the 2017 Ridgeline\n\t\t\n\t\tHonda had the opportunity to build a Tacoma crushing vehicle, but has instead built a truck that people can't decide whether it is a Sport Utility Vehicle or just a weak truck.  When you pull up to a stop light next to a Tacoma, Tundra or F150, you don't have the height of a real truck and it is not usable as rugged, durable, truck. \n\t\t\n\t\tOn the positive side...my wife liked it.","172":"Excellent truck for someone who wants functionality of a truck and economy of a car while not losing the ability of a truck.","173":"I have to echo most of the other glowing reviews that drivers of the '17 Ridgeline are saying.  Most clever truck on the market by far.  Only vehicle I've ever owned where people in parking lots come up and ask \"what kind of truck is that, it looks great\" or \"I saw you open the trunk in the bed, that is so cool!\"  Ride is great, seats are comfortable, and gas mileage is impressive.  I would have only 2 minor complaints: 1) rear doors don't open wide enough.  There's lots of space in the back with the seats folded up but the doors don't open wide enough to put a single large item in back, even though there's enough room inside.  2) the display is disappointing, hard to navigate and read, especially while driving.  Not intuitive at all.  Also, the blue tooth voice operation is sketchy and unreliable, not nearly as good as my '08 Camry. But again, these are MINOR compared to the overall greatness of the rest of the truck.  Considered Tacoma, Frontier, and Canyon, but waited to buy until the '17 Ridgeline was available.  So glad I did and intend to keep it for a long, long time.","174":"Buy whatever fits your need. This truck is very comfortable like driving my old $55K European SUV. you don't feel like driving a truck but a car. I drive 4 hrs roundtrip to my nearest airport 2-3 times a month and comfort is my big priority. I only need this truck during whitetail hunting, fishing, run to HD to pick up light gardening materials but not interested to tow a boat or go off roading. I also test drove Tacoma and Frontier but this one I really fell in love. So far all I want are in this truck. Not interested to T or any higher versions since I can use my smartphone for directions like the Waze app and to know where the cops are in the road.lol  In regards to music i can always rely on my spotify so I hardly listen to Radio broadcasts. So far I am please with comfort and ride especially I drive far monthly for work to nearby airports. thumbs up for Honda","175":"Be aware this is based on a few weeks and 900 miles of ownership. I am comparing it to my previous truck, a 2005 Nissan Frontier King Cab.  Handling is good, with slight body lean and a secure feeling in corners. I do find the steering a little light. Comfort is outstanding, as good as a car. The suspension smooths out bumps while still feeling firm, not bouncy. The front seats are comfortable and adjust nicely to my short old body. The rear seats seem at least adequate, and when they are folded up, the storage room is remarkable. The controls are scattered around a bit, but work well once I figured out where they are. I was apprehensive about the entertainment system, which has gotten unfavorable reviews. I found it to be unintuitive but once I worked past that, it does everything it is supposed to do. I have not yet used the voice control system. Entrance and exit is easy, even without running boards. The swing door on the bed is more useful than I expected. It makes it easier to reach into the bed and easier to get up into the bed. Overall a well designed cargo area. With one big demerit - tailgate doesn't lock! Still, I love this truck!","176":"the 2017 Ridgeline interior heat is poor. When you stop the interior heat drops off. Honda stated that this is a design of the vehicle and has no fix. Do not purchase for use in cold climate area's.","177":"The control handles for headlights and wipers do not glow in the dark.  Location may at first hard to see & find.  Once you get use to it no problem.  The engine is a little noisy at first thats because of injectors cutting on & off.  Honda made a good product with this truck.   Get the AWD makes a big difference on road control.","178":"Was in the market for an RTL-E but ended up buying a Black Edition based on a great deal I received. I've put about 1,000 miles on the truck so far, and overall I've been very pleased.","179":"Twice I have had an issue with the sensors giving every error. This is due to the sensor compartment getting wet. Dirt time driving in the rain. Second time after a car wash. I am told they will order parts and replace the unit. But since others are having the same issue. Honda needs to take another look at this area of the design. I paid cash for my vehicle, I love the truck. But will not put up with this issue.","180":"Although this vehicle hasn't been in production for two years and most people say do not buy the first year of a redesigned vehicle, you can't go wrong with the 2017 Ridgeline if you are looking for a medium duty pickup for occasional hauling, camping or your tailgating at your favorite teams game.  The water tight storage trunk in the bed is great for trips when you need that extra storage or when you need to load up on your favorite beverage for the tailgate to keep cold.  Easy access and the bed lighting form both sides when you open the trunk, truly make this a needed accessory on more vehicles.  The ride is smooth, the engine powerful and the remote start means you don't enter a cold vehicle in the winter or a hot one in the summer and that is important in West Texas.  The vehicle comes prewired for towing and even has a connection for trailer brakes, meaning you don't have to do extra wiring yourself or have to take it back to the dealer to have the wiring upgraded.  Mileage is good whether on the highway or making errands around town.  May be the best vehicle purchase I have made in the last 20 years.","181":"This truck has great handling and ride. The interior ergonomics are great and the center console is huge. The cup holders are annoying since anything that doesn't fit perfectly rattles like hell. i love the in bed trunk. I have been averaging 19mpg with a mix of CA highways and city driving. Right from the start i had 2 annoying rattles coming from the dash area which originates from inside the dash where i cannot reach. The rattle comes and goes with the fluctuation of temperatures. After 1000 miles my truck has developed 2 loud pops or bangs from the front when i am in reverse with the wheel turned(parking in reverse). After around 3000 miles my transmission developed a faint '1-click' under light acceleration in 4th gear. At 5000 miles that faint click has become noticeably louder and now occurs in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th gear. Along with the clicking the truck has developed very aggressive engine braking while low speed coasting or decelerating to a stop. This is a new car owners nightmare. It seems this truck was assembled on a weekend. I have never had a vehicle with this many problems from the get go. I have done some research and it seems although Honda is recently getting a bad rap for its 9 speed transmission, it has consistently had issues with transmissions in general. Also its JD reliability has dropped out of top 10 when in the past it was always top 3 or so. Be careful future buyers.","182":"This RTL-E is amazing, replaced my BMW 528 XI with this truck. So much more comfortable and user friendly. Apple Car Play makes up for the cartoonish Navi, if you can afford the extra $2K step up to the RTL-E you won't be disappointed. In bed sound system seemed like a gimmick but sounds great.","183":"If you need a hauling vehicle that you don't mind using on a first date, the Ridgeline won't disappoint you.  If you are a previous Ridgeline owner, you might have to overlook a few changes.  I'm not going into the technical specs. Trading in my silver 2008 RTL for a white 2017 RTL-T last month, I'm still making some adjustments.  Navigation and electronics: big upgrade.  Little changes:  Lock placement on glove compartment- Great;  change in placement of rear sliding window-Bad (I did not get sliding window on my truck).  Biggest adjustment: moving shifter from steering column to floor console eliminates several interior storage compartments that proved very useful in my 2008 truck.  Biggest disappointment: I expected a better increase is gas mileage.  My wife's hybrid makes me look like I'm a gas guzzler.  Most unique feature is still the \"under the bed trunk\".  This feature, along with the comfortable interior and overall Honda quality, eliminated the competition for me.","184":"Have owned numerous pickups over the years. Most recently an 03 Tacoma for 14 years until totaled. New Tacomas are nice but the ride leaves a lot to be desired. After researching and test driving the Ridgeline I was sold. Bought it for $2874 under listwith only a CD player added. I would recommend buying the rubber mats on Amazon. Genuine Honda $68 less than dealer. 5 days after picking it up left on a trip from Ct to Sc. Total of 2200 miles driven, what a pleasure. My wife couldn't believe the ride quality. Averaged 24.6 combined for the trip. I know of the complaints about the premium info center but my model is older with knobs. Does everything I want.  I never took the Tacoma off road nor towed with it. The Ridgeline is a perfect fit for what I need a pickup for. Weekly runs to the recycling center with occasional trips to HD or the garden center. This is the type of vehicle most pickup truck owners actually need.","185":"My new Ridgeline RTL-E is everything I hoped for and expected it to be. Very comfortable, smooth quiet ride (almost as good as my Lexus RX-350). Great safety features such as Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, Parking Sensors, etc. Excellent sound system (the RTL-E features the upgraded sound system and 8\" touch-screen infotainment system). Navigation system is easy to use. I especially like the voice activated commands for the Navigation and other systems. Storage under the rear seats is really nice as well as the in-bed trunk. The dual action tailgate (opens down as a traditional tailgate and swings open like a door) is very handy. As other owners have noted I wish the tailgate locked, especially since I plan to get the Honda tonneau cover. Overall this is one excellent vehicle!","186":"Despite being equipped with a towing hitch the electrical wiring is not complete. In order to tow you will need to purchase the final hitch working harness and have it installed.","187":"I've had my 17 Ridgeline for about a month and have been very pleased with everything about it. I was initially leaning towards a Tacoma, but after comparing the two vehicles for what my needs were - daily commuter, ability to move some furniture for my college aged daughter, take the snowblower in for service, transport my bike - it seemed like a better overall vehicle. The ONLY \"head scratcher\" to me is the inability to lock the tailgate...I just don't understand why that would be overlooked by Honda.","188":"Traded in our 2009 Ridgeline w\/ all bells and whistles. The new 2017 is lighter, quieter, steers straighter, more alive and fun to drive. The navigation is way easier lights are where they should be and both the headlights and taillights , LED are beautiful. RDl-E. love it","189":"Just what I wanted small truck plenty cargo space . Like the new look and design . Ride is very comfortable ride like a car great in snow. Black Edition has all the bells and whistles. Only had to add was the running boards and back cover .","190":"Fairly luxurious ride.  I would term it a\"gentleman's truck\".  Great storage and utility, the large locking trunk is a game changer.  You see so many trucks with tool boxes taking up 1\/3 of their bed space and they have to climb in the bed to access it.  The Ridgeline tool box is easily accessible thanks to the side opening tailgate.  The available tonneau cover easily folds back for open bed cargo and keeps things dry and protected when folded down.  I drove a Prius for 4 years previous to this and suffered from a sore tailbone from the seat, since driving the Ridgeline my pain is gone thank you very much.  I do miss the 50 mpg and am getting an average after ~1000mi 21.4 mpg.  They are having trouble keeping them in stock in my area, Austin TX, but the black painted models are still available.  It is a joy to drive if you need a truck.","191":"This truck is very comfortable to drive\/ride in.  Plenty of front seat room and adequate rear seat room for passengers.  With the rear seats folded up there is plenty of room for dogs or hauling groceries.  The handy lockable trunk in the truck bed is very nice for things that you don't want to load in the cab.  Drives very smooth.  This truck may not be the truck for people that want a true truck.  This is more like a luxury SUV with a truck bed.  Still have not tested the AWD features.","192":"This truck has very clever design.  The interior is posh, appointed like a higher end SUV - the exterior is very attractive but the storage\/cargo features are what sells the vehicle.  There is a lockable \"trunk\" hidden in the truck bed.  There is a drain hole so you could fill it with ice and beverages for tailgating, etc.  The bed is 4' wide so it can accommodate a 4x8 sheet of ply or drywall.  I haven't attempted that yet but the bed is flat (no wheel wells) so I believe it.  There are also several tie-downs located inside the bed.   The back seat can be pulled upward and latched creating a large cargo area there.  Stuff can be stowed under the back seat while it is down also.  I love the storage area between the two front seats.  It is very large and can fit a small to medium purse.   The truck drives like an SUV or even a car.  Very quiet and easy to drive.  Very nice vehicle.   Reliability and other aspects of longer term vehicle ownership are yet to be determined so I rated them a 4.","193":"The new design and reviews were the main selling points between the Ridgeline and other mid-sized trucks.  We were not interested in the infotainment technology of the RTL-T\/E's, and the RTL had just the right options for us.  I love the smooth non-truck like ride and the quietness overall from exterior noise and road noise.  I have not been a fan of the Honda fairly firm seats, but find it quite comfortable mainly because of the terrific suspension offering a very smooth ride.  I keep the Econ engaged 99% of the time, only turning it off when real power needed.  Results are great with nearly 23-24 mixed city\/highway driving.  The extra storage trunk in the bed is a huge plus, not to mention the dual opening tailgate.  So many great attributes about this 2017 Honda Ridgeline...far too many to mention.  I would highly recommend this truck to anyone not really needing a beefy 4wd truck.  After researching various buying programs (Edmunds, TruCar, USAA, etc), we found the very best, untouchable price through Costco.  Another dealer, who had the exterior\/interior color combo we desired available within a couple weeks, matched the one dealer Costco dealt with in the Denver area.  I couldn't be happier with the first truck I have ever owned over the past 40 years.","194":"This is my second Honda Ridgeline and so far I would highly recommend the vehicle.  There is just one more issue that I have to resolve with the dealership but do not expect any problems as they have been great so far.","195":"The 2017 Ridgeline has a design that allows rain water to enter the truck bed, even when covered by a Tonneau.  Its because its unibody. Owners need to be aware of this before they buy ANY Tonneau cover.  Look at the TOP ABS rail of the truck bed where it contacts the cab window.  You will see a rectangular opening in both corners, where the right side and the left side contact the truck cab.  Gently pour a bottle of water in this hole.  The majority of the water drains out the bottom of the truck and hits the ground.  However a portion of the water drains into the truck bed. So, ANY Tonneau cover will let rain water in. It will probably leak with a cab-height shell also.  And actually, all the rain water that hits the roof of the truck and drains down the rear window is liable to go into the bed through this hole too. There is no seal by design. A topper supplier told me that as of March 2017, Tonneau cover maker ARE is aware of this and trying to engineer a fix.   Just FYI.","196":"I have had my RTL-T for 6 weeks and love it!  My main disappointments are the technology and interior storage compartments.  Cup holders need to be like the Odyssey  with flapped inserts so you can put a standard plastic water bottle in them and not have it jump out on turns and speed bumps. they are to large and have no flaps to support the smaller cups and water bottles,  the door cavities are very small and shallow,  water bottles will not fit in any of the door cavities\/pockets and there is no holder for them in the door.  there is a shallow square french fry container holder which is not good for much.  the Ridgeline could have done better in using the wasted space in the 12 inch thick door its sister the Odyssey does.  The 8 inch touch screen is nice but it is kluge  to use the volume controls are hard to fumble with and the tuning is hard on the radio.  The Garmin Nav system had 2015 maps on it and the Android OS that runs the head unit behind the 8 inch screen was from 2010  android 4.2.2 and is incompatible with google play  try to use it and you get no longer supported version.  So the bottom line is i really like the ride, comfort, power, MPG, utility and looks the technology leaves a lot to be desired.","197":"I drove the Ridgeline RTL-T and found the interior cramped especially around the driving pedals -- the parking brake pedal interferes with foot and leg movement.

It was a bit on the pricey side (though I did add almost $4,000 in add-ons), but when considering what I got for the price, I can't really complain. I'm still in awe of how smooth and unbelievably quiet a ride it is, which I tell friends is comparable to the Cadillac Sedan de Ville I used to drive on occasion for work. I'm not a fan of the built-in nav system, but since it has Apple Car Play I just use Apple Maps, which is much better (though not as good as Waze, which I wish could be used with Car Play). I also can't get the system to recognize ANY voice commands, but then again I rarely try since I'm not a fan of vocal commands anyway. But features like the two-way tailgate and especially the trunk are WAY cool and never fail to impress friends and other truck owners. I was also VERY pleasantly surprised by the acceleration and pick-up it has. I've only had the truck a few weeks so I can't comment on maintenance or reliability, but so far I'd say that it's the best new vehicle purchase I've ever made!","199":"Great vehicle. Everything I wanted and more. Honda quality!","200":"Dealer wrapped a tonneau cover into my purchase which would have been great if the tailgate locked. I carry items that do not fit into the trunk and must be locked. My salesman assured me the tailgate would lock. not so. We are working on a fix. Other than that I love this truck. I call it a cluck for chick truck or car truck. The mirrors do not retract by power. 2 complaints which honda could easily fix for probably not that much money and it would be perfect. I am coming from a bmw and this truck is much more clever and solid. It is an outstanding vehicle.","201":"Consider the Ridgeline before buying a Tacoma or Frontier.","202":"I had really high hopes for this new Ridgeline, but after driving this vehicle for the last 8+ months I can say that it's a real disappointment especially compared to the previous generation.  I had a 2008 Ridgeline that I really liked, but the new one is nothing like the previous generation.  The new Ridgeline just doesn't have that nice solid feel that the previous generation did.  The biggest issue with the new Ridgeline is stability.  The steering is over-powered and light feeling as well as being overly sensitive to the road surface.  This leads to a lot of road vibration in the steering wheel.  Some reviewers have stated that there isn't much feedback from the road.  Since driving this vehicle for 8+ months, I can say that it's not that you don't get much feedback.  It's that you get the wrong feedback, and too much of it.  Small insignificant road imperfections (small bumps, small cracks, etc) cause feedback into the steering wheel where you would expect to not even notice.  I will concede that some of the steering issues that I've stated could be due to the lousy Firestone tires that come on the truck.  The suspension is just on the edge of being bouncy, so when driving it feels a bit like floating around on the highway.  This leads to the truck being very sensitive to even light breezes making driving on windy days very difficult.  Other poor design issues: When coming to a complete stop, the truck rocks back and forth about 10-12 times before becoming motionless (which is weird as I've never experienced this on any other vehicle), the heated seat switches look and feel like they came out of a vehicle from about 20 years ago, many of the safety features are intrusive (such as the Collision Mitigation Braking System...if it worked better it would be ok), the entertainment system is a bit clunky (it's running a VERY old version of Android), the rear hvac controls are located with the main hvac controls (this doesn't even make sense especially in the RTL-E which is the trim level that I have).   The biggest build quality issue that I've noticed is that both front doors are not mounted straight (it's not noticeable on mine unless you look closely, but once I noticed it I see it every time I get in the truck); however, there were a couple of others that have been corrected by the dealer (including something that was broken).  On the positive side, the truck has a comfortable ride, the seats are comfortable, the technology is much better than previous gen, the look is much more truck-like, the brakes are pretty good, the engine is pretty good (although it could use a bit more low-end power), the transmission is pretty good, better fuel mileage than the previous Ridgeline.","203":"The most versatile  vehicle on the market.   Waited three years to get a new one.  Wait was worth it.","204":"This is my second Ridgeline the first one was a 2007. It many bumps and warts but the 2017 fixed a lot of the issues. The gas mileage has improved significantly where I can easily get 21 mpg around town and 28 on the highway (which beats the EPA estimates). The ride, handling, power and acceleration have improved dramatically. Honda kept the great lockable trunk in the bed that is quite large and can double as an ice chest. The towing capacity has not changed, but I really didn\u2019t buy this vehicle to tow anything other than a light capacity utility trailer. The fit and finish is Honda; quality materials, fit and finish as is always expected from them. But for all of Honda vaunted design and engineering prowess, they in my estimation missed the mark on several things. First off the navigation system is nothing more than a \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d Garmin that has been bloated to the point of nearly impossible usefulness. First off, there is this beautiful 8\u201d color screen that has these jumbo marquees and icons that reduce the overall useful height to roughly 3 \u00bd\u201d. What a waste of space. The marquees contain the street name\/highway you are on or the name of an upcoming intersection. The size of the lettering is so large a blind person might almost be able to read it. Thus the need for the wide marquees. In the bottom corners there are two marquees (one each side) that consume 2\/3rds the width of the screen and are about \u00be\u201d high. One contains the current altitude and the other the direction of travel. You can swap the data back and forth, but cannot turn them off. As with the marquee at the top of the screen they also contain large letters and numbers that are out of proportion to their usefulness. There are various large icons, some of which can be turned off floating around the map surface as well. The biggest issue with the navigation system is its interface. It is one of the most convoluted, un-intuitive ones I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of using. \n\nThe next issue I have with the 2017 Ridgeline is the rear doors. Like many SUVs, the back row seats are more for kids than adults except for short jaunts around town. The problem is the rear doors only open about 65 to 70 degrees at most making entry and exit into the back seat for anyone but a kid an act of gymnastics. I can\u2019t believe Honda could not come up with a better design than this.\n\nMy final gripe is the lack of locking tailgate. I\u2019m overly concerned that someone could steal the tailgate. There attachment points are somewhat complicated and it would take a highly determined and knowledge individual some amount of time and effort to take it off. The issue for me, and probably many other 2017 Ridgeline owners is installing a tonneau cover and securing contents in the bed. Honda offers, and I might add a rather expensive, folding tonneau cover for the 2017 Ridgeline. No drilling or rail attachments are required, and when the rear third of the cover is folded up the trunk lid opens all the way without any interference. I will admit that it is not 100% watertight but it is good enough for the average person. The tonneau cover as with the tailgate is not lockable. If the tailgate was lockable and with the tonneau cover down and clamped one could not get into the pickup bed without a key. Thus I could go to several shopping destinations, put things in my pickup bed and secure them until I was ready to unload. \n\nPros: \nGreat gas mileage\nVery good power and acceleration\nQuality fit, finish and materials\nExceptional riding comfort and handling\n\nCons:\nPoor navigation system and interface\nPoor rear door entry space\nNon-lockable tailgate","205":"After doing a lot of research for the last 6 months all avenues lead me back to the Honda Ridgeline. To me, the Black Edition looks the best of all the available models. I did add the hard tonneau cover, black rugged side steps, and CD player. The cover and the side steps really completes the look of the Black Edition. It looks very sporty. I have only had the truck for about a three weeks but so far I have been really happy with the purchase. Compare to my company Tacoma and S-10, the Ridgeline is a dream in difference. The Ridgeline rides very nice without jarring around over bumps like a typical truck. It rides about as smooth and almost as quiet as my Mercedes GLC. The truck has great pick up when you step on it and the 6 speed transmission does not feel like its hunting for the correct gear. I cannot say how it performs in the snow as this has been a very mild winter. The Black Edition and the RTL-E both comes with more bells and whistles than I know how to use and I am a very techie guy. It has tons of safety features such as lane departure, blind spot monitoring, back-up camera with cross traffic sensors, and adaptive cruise control. For what I use the truck for the Ridgeline fills all my needs. I do not haul or tow for a living and I am not a mudder\/off-roader. My main needs are driving to visit family, weekend household hauling, and towing my fishing boat.","206":"I drove a Dodge Dakota for 170,000 miles and was in love with it. But when I sat in the 2017 Ridgeline, there was no comparison. The comfort, convenience, and features were worlds apart. Granted, the Ridgeline is 20 model-years newer, but Honda got it all right. It is spacious and drives like an SUV, with great acceleration and an ample back seat, which folds up to get out of your way when necessary. The bed is a little short, but is packed with conveniences including the bi-directional gate, lighting, and large cargo well. I should have gone up one trim level for upgraded electronics, but all in all I love it and expect to drive if for the next 20 years.","207":"I have bought more than ten new Accords and Fits and always been please completely. Buying the Ridgeline was a mistake I made. It seems to me to be mostly plastic and not designed with the owner in mind. The engine has a timing belt rather than a chain which will require substantial cost in the future if I keep it which I probably will not. The engine is covered with a shield that is secured with rubber grommets that came off and went flying when I removed it. It was difficult to reinstall. The bed is slanted such that it holds moisture and dust. It is difficult to get in and out of the drivers seat. The view out the back window is restricted by the head rests. The road noise is more than any vehicle I have owned but I understand some think this is from the Firestone tires. The ride seems floaty like being in a boat.  I thought I was buying a Honda truck but instead got a Honda car with a partial truck bed that seems to not be designed by the Honda engineers that structure the cars. The bells and whistles are far too many and seem to be added in some cases because they could be rather than being needed. The instructions of using them take time  to comprehend. The selection was my fault for having owned many Hondas in the past and never having to investigate the quality of any of them. Study the vehicle in depth before buying and you may be very pleased but as it is different so do not assume it is like prior Honda vehicles you may have owned.","208":"I was looking for the right truck.  I was frankly partial to the F150.  When I really checked it out, it was too big.  The Honda Ridgeline is perfect for me.  It is a truck that drives like the Accord.  It holds the road and is comfortable- no big vehicle sway.  It has plenty of power and very driveable.  The bed is rugged and comes lined.  Also, there is a hatch in the bed that opens to a trunk that is lighted.  There are stadium style rear seats with plenty of room.  It has a Garmin GPS which is far more accurate than those that come with cars. For me, the only downside is that it doesn't have memory for the driver's seat position.","209":"I was looking for a midsize truck but didn't like the idea of rear wheel drive w\/ 4WD. The Ridgeline with AWD fit perfectly. I wanted a long bed so not a crew cab. But the Ridgeline crew cab has a lot of storage under the rear seats and a flat floor. The truck bed is also flat. The tail gate opens to the side as well as conventionally. The in bed trunk is huge. The 2017 Ridgeline is a very comfortable SUV with a really big trunk.","210":"If you are looking for a great driving, comfortable riding pickup then get a new Ridgeline.  I bought the RTL-T AWD model and can't find anything I'd change.  It's actually more comfortable than the 2011 Accord coupe I once owned. I am getting over 22 mpg in the month I've been driving it.","211":"Know exactly what you want as far as infotainment options; as they are different on every level. I'm a Silverado old-school guy, so the RTL is perfect for me. However, some options that are desirable (i.e.) XM radio and\/or CD player, you will be forced  to go up 1 level just for that. Leather seats are much more comfortable than the cloth. Drive train and layout are the same on all. I was impressed enough to give up my newer Silverado for this more manageable and comfortable truck. Access to the bed on 3 sides is unmatched. I have driven a UPS truck for 23 yeas,  so I know what a rough ride is. 5k towing is adequate for my Harley. If you desire a full size bed  or want to pull a house off its foundation, This isn't your truck. The Ridgeline is a combo of luxury car with a bed that fits 4x8 plywood. Was never a big fan of the previous models. This one caught my eye. Fun to drive and no ladder needed to enter the cab or bed. 4 wheel independent suspension and the AWD system are very refined. Visibility is very good. The icing on the cake is being designed, manufactured, and built in Alabama. Gm trucks contain at least 40% parts made south of the border as stated on the door sticker. I am happier keeping those folks in Alabama working an earning a living.","212":"WHY??? Why, Honda, did you not give us a locking tailgate?","213":"Bought the especially designed top cover for the bed because the ad said it would protect and keep your belongings DRY.mine got soaked.The dealership only gave me a partial refund and explained the difference between waterproof and keeping things dry!After market people are afraid to touch it because there is a slide in bed protecter and they do not know what is behind it.So I am stuck with an open bed.and the dealership will not help.A fantastic truck is being ruined by a dealership and a leaking bed cover.","214":"It will be hard to find. If you want one be prepared to put a deposit down and wait for it to come off the assembly line. I have been wanting a Ridgeline for years. I am a Honda loyalist and at first I didnt like the new look. Until I drove it, the thing drives like a car. I am 6'3 so I am used to looking over people when I walk and when I drive and this fits the bill. The lane keep assist will basically drive for you for approx 15 seconds and there is storage everywhere. The power back window was a unexpected bonus along with the Honda assist for 3 garage doors.","215":"I love the truck.  The touch screen is a little finicky sometimes, but it's the most comfortable vehicle I've owned, to date, in regards to how it hugs the road, and how it envelopes my body.  Every day, I find myself looking for excuses to drive someplace.","216":"It rides like a car, but has the capability to carry objects like a truck.  It is easy getting into that most trucks in this class.  No complaints so far.  There is a very small pool of colors.  The dealership only had 3 Ridgelines and if you wanted one you are stuck with the colors available.","217":"shop a lot. buy thru a service if you can.","218":"This is the nicest riding mid sized truck on the market. I'm very happy with mine.","219":"Surprised there is no CD player.","220":"I have tried to put the heat controls pointing to just the floor and due to the small openings there is not enough heat to keep the floor warm.  Just took a trip to Chicago and had cold feet all the way.  I took the vehicle back to the dealer and was told it works just like the other 2017 units and that was how it works.  Definitely not impressed with the outcome of the dealer visit.  My 2003 Jeep Wrangler has a better heater than this new 2017 Honda Ridgeline RTS","221":"Good so far, hope it holds up to other hondas in reliability. Now over 8000 miles, no issues.","222":"Great handling and ride, well thought out interior.","223":"Love the truck. Wish the rear doors opened wider. Wish the radio had a tuning knob.","224":"I was interested in seeing this vehicle but was intent on buying another SUV. I was not quite convinced about the outward appearance- it looks a little homely. But once you get behind the wheel it really shines. Very comfortable, plenty of power and all the technology I really need. I need a truck every now and then. They can be very convenient but my main driving could be handled by any car. This vehicle drives like a car but has the ability to be a light truck. Perfect for me. I have read about the cumbersome technology package but I have had no problem. The nav system is much better than my previous 2006 Nissan murano. Links easily to my Iphone.  I like Apple Car play.  I have had it now for 2 months and the looks is growing on me. Not a single mechanical problem.","225":"Like the new styling.","226":"My spouse has a new Pilot so this is very similar. Love that car. It is exactly what I wanted. Trunk space is a real plus. It works very well for us.","227":"The 2017 Honda Ridgeline was our chosen competitor vehicle for the Inaugural Rebelle Rally this past October and we took 1st Place in rossover class. We were entered in the crossover class because of the Ridgeline's unibody construction and its All Wheel Drive. This did not limit us at all! We had a blast driving this truck from Lake Tahoe, Nevada down 2000 km offroad to the sand dunes of Glamis, CA. The entire time this truck was a champ. Ours is called Goldie and she handled like a dream. We were on all types of terrain from flat packed dirt roads, double tracks, open desert including lumps of vegetation to maneuver around, rocky inclines and mountain ridges! We drove in washes and gullies, dry lake beds and OHV trails. We saw parts of the country unseen by many and our Ridgeline capably got us there! We were impressed, but not at all surprised! Everyone who had a chance to drive Goldie during our training, fell in love with her abilities! Not only did we outscore our closest opponent by 140 pts, we finished 4th overall (36 teams) and we finished second, by two points, behind the winner of the bone stock award which was given to the stock vehicle with the most earned points. We loved this truck so much, we are taking her back for round two, this coming October!  We had to haul spare parts, camping gear,  2 pair of  MAXTRAX,  a spare offroad tire, safety equipment,  air compressor, luggage, snacks, tools, maps and navigating equipment, a driver and a navigator and there was plenty of room for everything we needed just by putting it in the cargo area with the rear seats lifted up, and also within that beautiful in bed trunk!! Some serious separation anxiety happened when we returned back to our real lives, but while we were a rally driver and a rally navigator, and Goldie was our third teammate...we loved every minute of being a team! If you want further information on the Rebelle Rally, please visit rebellerally.com. I hope to inspire other Ridgeline owners to take your trucks off-road, off the beaten path and most especially just out of the driveway to explore and adventure together!  See you in the dirt!!!","228":"Leg room if you are over 6 foot tall is a little cramped for the driver.  My right leg is constantly resting against the center console when in my normal driving posture.  I feel the gas and break pedals and the overall floor space of the drivers side could use another 6 inches or so forward.  In my opinion the center console, while useful with ample storage and space to place things, leaves the comfort level a little to be desired.  I've owned the larger Ford F-150 and a RAM in the past along with smaller Tacoma, Frontier and Ranger.  True, the larger trucks have better power and towing and the smaller vehicles have the better gas mileage, but this truck manages to land perfectly in between the two sizes.  Even with my little issue with the center console I feel this is a perfect mid-sized truck.  The size reminds me of the old T100 from Toyota in which I missed out on.  I thought that was a perfect sized truck as well.  Power of the V6 in my Ridgeline RTL AWD is good and is perfect for my driving needs.  Mostly daily commuting 40 miles round trip to work.  Then, lite payloads and towing for weekend projects.  This truck drives like a car and has decent visibility and good road mannerisms. Overall the truck is solid.  Honda name tag is solid and reliable with typical great resale values.  Not that I plan on selling it.  The finishes and layout for the user are solid.  The technology is good and is easy to understand and use.  Averaging 23.3 mpg after 2000 miles.  The rear seats are comfortable and leg room is good, not great for adults.  The folding rear seats are easy to engage\/disengage even for smaller folks like children and with folded seats the truck offers additional flat floor space for payloads that require more security.  The hidden well below the bed is a neat little feature.  I'm using it more than I thought I would.  The other small issue I have is that the tail gate does not lock.    Again, overall, this is a great mid-sized truck.  You will not pull the house off its foundation with its 5000 tow rating, but you will be able to handle the majority of your weekend projects around the house and do so in style and comfort.","229":"First off this truck is amazing. So much we almost got two but could not get two so we got a new fit. But this Vehicle is great. When driving you completely forget your in a \"truck\". I have a 99 ford f350 diesel and a 05 jeep wrangler. I have owned a Colorado and Ranger. Nothing compares I have never bought a new vehicle till i bought this brand new and well the fit to. the truck has lived up to everything so far. We have put about 2000 miles on it since thanksgiving. I live in upstate ny and where in snow season now. I did get stuck...but wait whats this snow mode button do and insistently i was unstuck amazing great system. It makes no funny noises that a vehicle shouldn't make. It easy to clean not to many hiding pockets to catch all the salt. This radio thing people are complaining about...well it took us about 1500 miles before we got the hang of it. Its much easier to use if you use the voice or steering wheel controls. Then you never need to touch anything. Plus its a computer you need to give things a chance to \"think\". Compared to the fit the controls are not very driver orientated but your passenger will do just fine. Were a drive in couple and the bed speakers will rock the heck out of the drive in this summer we cant wait. Are real average for gas so far is under 21 mpg. We do a ton of mix driving plus its winter now. The vehicle just makes you want to drive it which is what a vehicle of USE ABILITY should do for you. No complaint's now only time to wait for the type-r civic.......","230":"The only downside thus far is the infotainment system. As others have noted, it is so ancient. I had a 10 year old Prius which was better and a 2013 VW which was legions ahead of this clunky mess. Really, Honda, who the hell is working for you and worse, signing off on this mess of a system? Otherwise, a great car. Oh, one further nitpick, the outboard mirroruare so bloody old school. Really, idiots.","231":"Truck bed needs better rails to accommodate racks, different tie down configurations.  Sliding rear window needs to be available across all the trim levels. Cup holders in the doors need to be deeper, water bottles keep flopping around when you drive. Heated seats need to be on a timmer to shut off after a extended amount of time, plus they don't really get that warm to begin with, you can barely tell they work. AWD needs more ground clearance for extra assurance on those rough dirt roads (like my old Tacoma prerunner). I do love the smooth and quieter ride than my 15 year old Tacoma.20","232":"We actually looked at and drove an RTL (very nice), but we decided that we wanted some of the features on the RTL-E (adaptive cruise control, lane assist, blind spot warning, collision braking). Apparently everyone else likes them too! Sales people have told me these are literally sold as soon as a VIN is assigned *before it is built*! Sales people kept trying to get me to buy the RTL (which they sometimes had available sporadically), but if I'm going to pay that much for a car I want it to be what I want, not what I might settle for. (Also, don't expect them to give any discount, even through Edmunds.)","233":"This is the best vehicle I have ever owned","234":"I traded a 2012 RTL that I liked a lot and the 2017 is a step up.  Most of the negatives of the previous generation Ridgeline have been addressed,   Here goes the pluses:   1)The MPG is great, first tank of HWY driving I averaged 27.  2)The quiet of the cab is impressive, better than most cars.  3)The seats are all day comfortable and 4)the ride is serene. 5)It goes straight down the road.  6)It is much quicker than my 2012, much.  So, it is a home run, but a few things keep it from being a grand slam.  Here goes my reasoning:  1)Why no Michelin tires? Firestone Destinations are just OK. 2)The armrests are small and cheap looking. For the price there should be an 3)electric rear window, 4)sunroof and 5)presets for two drivers. 6)Plus the dull black trim between the front and back windows beg for chrome trim to match the rest of the window trim.  The styling is a \"beauty is in the eyes of the beholder issue\" so I'll not add my opinion, but the San Marino red color would make it pop.","235":"I'm 2 months into ownership and absolutely love the Ridgeline RTL-E. It's smooth, comfortable and elegant with the alloys, running boards, chrome and rear tri-fold cover. It's a head turner in pearl white.  This is my first truck and it's everything I will ever need in utility. If you're looking to drive in comfort and have the ability to pick up stuff at Home Depot and could care less about hauling and off road this is more truck then you'll ever need. This truck is well mannered, car- like and composed and I love all of the tech features, lane departure, collision mitigation and the auto hi-beams. Audio has great sound, Navigation is great but the touch screen is quirky and takes some getting used to. I think they should change the touch screen going forward. They need to add cooled seats and outside mirror signals, as the RTL-E is the top of the line. Lastly the tailgate does not lock; bummer. Overall, great truck!","236":"very comfortable and quiet, didn't care for the $1500 'blacked out' edition,but sunroof is only available on top two trim levels-and anything else is difficult to find(honda's fault?) nice ride,lotsa storage-nice compromise if you need a truck that acts like a car.","237":"Sports utility truck, not a work truck, ideal for many people. If you want to lift your truck and go off-road rock crawling, this truck is not for you.  if you want a highly designed, engineered and comfortable truck to help you through your active mobile life, seriously consider the new G2 Ridgeline.","238":"I went through Tacoma, Canyon, Ridgeline and Colorado. Exactly in that order. Money wise Colorado is your best but it's also the worst in terms of design, handling and overall quality. Canyon is just little better but still far inferior to Tacoma. Both Colorado and Canyon are example how not to design interior of small tuck, imo it's just horrible. Tacoma low sitting position is beyond awkward and the best off road capability is not sell option for me in Florida where I live. I was surprise how good Ridgeline stands among others - roomy interior, very good quality fit and finish, SUV like ride and this bed trunk where I'm diving so very often for my tools. I have bed where I can lay flat 4x8 and dual action tailgate to dive into the trunk. For me bed trunk is huge advantage 'cos any tool box installed on bed render it somehow useless. Ridgeline is not perfect ( which truck is ? ) I found quite annoying that rear cab doors can't be fully open to 90 deg.","239":"You have read it other reviews, but the full throttle power is pretty awesome.  I have the front wheel drive model and have to back off  of the pedal due to spinning the tires too much.  The braking is very good.  The ride is so much more quieter than the older model.  The suspension handles potholes and big bumps without worry, as in the beginning I would wince and brace that I surely would have a jarring experience.  The sound system  is very good.  I had not heard HD radio before and now I won't use XM radio.  Old songs sound great again on HD radio.  I do have some comments and complaints.  The '-T' in RTL-T stands for technology and lots of computer processing.  After starting engine, the navigation takes a while to boot up and I have learned not to touch it until I think it's available and then wait 5 more seconds before I use it.  You can't jump in and start your truck, plug in an address in the navigation and take off.  Also after starting, the steering wheel volume buttons don't react at all sometimes and your natural instinct will be to keep pushing the volume buttons.  Eventually, the volume will react to all of the pushing on the volume buttons and will give an extremely loud or quiet volume.  These are minor and you learn to adapt.  My complaint is that my truck comes with receiver to tow trailers or boat, but is pre-wired for the trailer lights.  When I asked for the wiring kit, it was $266 at thdealer.   Really Honda? Update: I bought the trailer wiring kit for $200 and installed it.  If you plan to install yourself, download the instructions to see if you want to take it on.  It wasn't an easy task.  You have to remove the rear seats, remove covers, and remove the trim by the side air bag to access the brake controls.  A special rivet nut tool is needed to mount the 7 pin socket\/harness.","240":"People ask me why I switched from the Tacoma to the Ridgeline. Well, the Ridgeline just does everything better except for hard core off-roading. The seats are more comfortable, it's quieter, handles better, fuel economy is better and is just easier to live with on a daily basis. Having driven 3 VW GTIs for the last 10 years, my bride and I decided we wanted to explore the good 'ol USA and, after MUCH research we bought a Lance 1475 TT ( 3600 lb GVW) . A GTI is not known for its towing abilities so a pick-up was up next. The Tacoma has a sterling reputation and the refreshed one was just out. Test drive revealed that, yes, it is a pick-up with the appropriate capabilities we needed. It was not particularly comfortable or quiet but it is a pick-up, after all. This past summer, after owning the Tacoma for 4 months I saw that the new Ridgeline was out and was curious about it. Did not really think it was a contender for what my usages are (75% commuting, 300 mi wk, 25% towing). The local dealer finally had one on the lot, so I stopped and took a look-see. Nice, but not the burly styled ride the Tacoma is. A little later another one showed up. I was still curious so I stopped in and took a test drive. Big, BIG mistake! If I had known that this pick-up was coming out at the same time I was looking at the Tacoma, it would not have even been considered. As far as towing goes, they both do a fine job but the Ridgeline is just better in-spite of the lower tow rating. One interesting thing to mention is the Tacoma had a payload rating of 956 lbs while the Ridgeline had a payload of 1397 lbs.","241":"I was looking for a truck when I found the Ridgeline.  I thought I would replace my Pilot with another SUV.  My son had a Tacoma and complained about the rough truck ride so I did not think I would like a truck.  I test drove the Ridgeline and found it drove as smoothly as an SUB.  The rear seat was roomy and comfortable.  I loved the trunk feature and the side opening tailgate. People I work with are impressed and are considering purchasing other Ridgelines.  This was a great purchase and I would recommend a Ridgeline to a friend.","242":"I researched and  test drove the Tacoma, Frontier, and the Colorado. The Ridgeline was hands-down the best truck for me. I am a contractor &  this is my daily driver. I carry tools in the trunk, and three or four men  to job sites every morning.  There's always something in the bed. Honda could take a cue from Chevy and put a step in the rear bumper, as the bed is high to make room for the deep trunk. The truck is  quick, smooth driving, quiet and comfortable.  Payload is more than adequate for a midsize truck,  and it tows  5000 pounds with ease.The trimline packaging limits configuration. I would like to have had the suite of safety features  without some of the frills that came with higher trim levels.","243":"No CD player. Very comfortable, nice GPS, good mpg!","244":null,"245":"This truck is very quiet and smooth, the corning and ride are so controlled that you will have to constantly remind yourself that you are driving an AWD truck and not a fancy European sports sedan. I had to drive 200 miles to a dealer out of my area to get the base model RT with AWD. My trip home was a mix of four lane Highway, small towns with a lot of stops, school buses and school zones yet I still managed just under 28 MPG. I hooked my trailer loaded with my Argo 8x8 just to see how the Ridge Line would respond pulling 2000 pounds. Hooking the trailer was very easy because of the excellent back up camera. Once underway the engine worked a little harder than I expected but the truck handled the load without any drama. I fully expect to get over 20 MPG pulling my trailer loaded with an Argo 8x8 and lots of equipment, that kind of fuel mileage is impressive for any truck. The truck impresses in little ways. While I was driving home several large bugs hit my windshield. Instead of splattering as I expected they passed over my truck. When I got home I noted the very steep rake of the windshield, it may not seem like much but it kept the window clean and adds to the RT's ability to ease down the highway on windy days. The seats felt a little firm at first but after I settled in they were quite comfortable. I was really disappointed that my standard RT didn't come equipped with an XM radio but the standard AM\/FM has excellent sound quality and picked up distant stations without an issue. This truck is very easy to get in and out of and is super quiet on the highway with a ride quality that will remind you of an expensive luxury sedan. The engine is a little louder then I would like under hard acceleration but I can live with it. This truck is handsome.  Maybe not the best looking truck ever built but better looking then the competition. The tail gate opens two ways and there is a ton of water proof storage under the rear of the bed that is easy to reach for loading and unloading and this storage area can double as an ice chest with a drain plug in the bottom. I am impressed by the composite bed which is strong, durable and resistant to dings and scratches. I wouldn't take this truck four wheeling but I am sure that if you use the AWD system within it's limitations it will serve you very well. If you want something that will serve your needs as a truck, keep you moving with AWD in winter driving conditions and drive and handle like a luxury car I don't see how you can do better then the Honda Ridge Line.\n\nAlright, just a few updates. The truck is averaging  about 20.9 MPG in mixed driving conditions. It's  not doing as well as I thought it would pulling a trailer with an average  of somewhere  between 15 and 16 mpg. I miss not having an XM radio and a dealer installed XM with a backup camera is over two thousand dollars. I still think the engine is a little to loud under acceleration but really that's about my only complaint. I have had the chance to use the AWD on three different occasions and was very impressed. The ability to drop into low gear and puck the  AWD mode is a very nice feature and worked well for me when I had to drag a fallen tree across my front yard. I have also had to use the AWD mode pulling a loaded trailer up a step sandy hill that would have stuck a lot of other 4 wheel drive trucks, with the Honda it was no problem. I haven't driven this truck in snow yet but I am sure it's excellent traction and low center of gravity would work very well in winter conditions.","246":"Dead pedal prevents me from extending my left leg whilst driving and there is no room between the dead pedal and the brake to extend my left leg.  (Emergency brake is too obtrusive as well.) Arm rests for driver are too small and wimpy...I would have preferred a large ratcheting cushion over the center bin.  Rear seat room is very limited when I have the driver's seat set to my liking.  No memory features for seats AND mirrors.  Center console information system is too unwieldy.  EXCELLENT cabin isolation!  Why oh why did the Honda marketing\/sales geniuses decide that Canada should get the vented front seats and the USA only gets the heated ones????  Common Honda, enlighten the masses on that great call!","247":"The interior crew cab is the most roomy and comfortable of all the competition.  And the ride and power are awesome.  But not without its problems.  The truck was delivered with one of the engine mount sensors disconnected which gave it a rough ride.  After this was addressed the dash instrument module plastic window began to rattle and vibrate at various speeds.  Also when driven on the highway around 70-75 in ECON mode coupled with cruise control, the engine vibrates and causes the dash to rattle.  I returned the car to the dealer to fix (they were unable to fix) and the loaner civic they gave me was very cheap and plastic and also rattled so I think the quality at Honda has become hit and miss.  This truck is truly amazing at its best, and around town I don't experience any of these issues.  But on the highway, the dash rattle and  vibration is not acceptable, and I don't intend to buy another Honda.","248":"P\/U's have been redefined and the Ridgeline is no exception. Its not a work truck, but it is a great utility vehicle thats comfortable to drive 7 days a week, including long trips. It doesn't lack for power, quite inside and a good deal of overall storage","249":"The truck has great visibility, features, handling, and comfort.  It combines the feel of driving an SUV or crossover, with a bed.  If I wanted a semi, I'd buy one.  So, the people that feel that it's 'not a real truck' - whatever, enjoy your 3 mpg and stepladder mounted to the side.  You haul the same amount as I do in all likelihood...  but yes, I might want something larger if I was towing a yacht  or megacamper, or concrete, or something.  Then, consider a megatruck.","250":"UPDATED 3\/20\/17: Still like the vehicle, with a few disappointments. Acceleration is good when mashing the peddle, but low end responsiveness in day to day driving is weak. Transmission never seems to be in the gear I want making precise control of speed difficult. A manual mode or a performance mode to flip the computer to a more aggressive dynamic would alleviate, but alas the only option is a lone button to downshift to D4. Steering\/handling remains a Honda strength and is exceptional, as the vehicle steers like a car. It also rides like a Honda, which is to say a bit on the stiff side, but tuning makes it handle great on uneven terrain and a worthwhile tradeoff. Storage is great, you really can fit a golf bag under the rear seat, and the rear trunk and bed are both wide and useful. I hate the touch screen interface, after 6 months I still get lost at times as it is not intuitive. The E trim also states \"premium\" sound, but the frequency dynamics leave something to be desired, as off the shelf components I installed on my old truck beats this new premium stereo (not by a lot, but by enough to note). MPG is underwhelming and exactly as stated on sticker, no more. Others have noted higher than advertised MPG (even up to 30), but that is a myth, as the average MPG calculator on this vehicle (as well as the 2016 Pilot's) overstate by ~2 MPG. I have to wonder if Honda did that on purpose? Suggestion, verify your MPG using a calculator at the gas pump, as the info center gets it wrong on this vehicle. Lighting: I keep getting flashed by opposing drivers with dim headlights on. Not sure if they are aimed to too high or what, but never had that problem on any other vehicle. Instrument cluster is average and has the stuff you'd expect on a modern vehicle. The real time MPG in info center is completely worthless though, not granular enough, and difficult to read. If anything should have been digital vs analog, it's that. Interior lights are weak and narrow (like a spotlight). Cannot see a large portion of the storage areas of the car at night. Chimes from the cluster are tinny. Power rear sliding window and sunroof work great. Mirror defroster works great (less than a minute). Front seat headrests are poorly positioned (they lean too far forward). I actually had to remove my drivers head rest and swap it with a rear head rest (those are not tilted). Felt like my head was tilted forward 24\/7. HVAC is strong, heats and cools quickly, and controls are easy to use. Front ground clearance is more light SUV than \"truck\", however, the front air dam is a flexible rubber instead of hard plastic, meaning you can scrape the ground and it bends instead of breaks. I tested this out through a creek bed and scraped the air dam (not on purpose, haha) and it came out with some grass on it, but no damage. The USB ports only work with car in ACC or ON. Come on Honda, I can't leave my phone in the car to charge without turning on all accessories? The spare tire (while not \"full size\") is in the trunk and away from the elements. This may not seem like a big deal until years down the road and you have a flat. Trust me when I tell you not being able to remove the spare tire on your rusted out undercarriage of a truck will have you saying a few choice words, been there, done that. Nice design Honda! Rear camera works and has 3 top down viewing angles to choose from which makes hitching up a trailer very easy, however, the resolution on the camera is poor, and, if it's raining it gets wet and blurry. The vehicle tows Ok and pulls my 2500 lb boat easily. The driver assist technology is semi-useful, but a bit gimmicky at the same time. Lane keeper will drive the car for you on \"level\" pavement, even around moderate curves, however it doesn't work well on sloped pavement as it drifts all the way to the line before correcting. On level pavement, it's dead true. It also only stays on for 15 seconds before it makes you touch\/grab the wheel for a second (then the 15 seconds restarts). Blind spot detection works but not very useful, however, the backup warning of side traffic works great and has great range. This helps when backing out of spots where it's hard to see, or if you're not paying attention. It actually helped me avoid a jogger wearing black at dusk when backing out of driveway one night! The single most useful feature is probably the adaptive cruise, which actually works, but I would like to see more configuration options on distance from preceding vehicle. Road departure not very helpful, comes on after you're already heading into the ditch (i.e. too late). Overall, after 6 months, I've lowered my opinion of the vehicle slightly due it being advertised as a \"truck\", but missing key \"truck\" like features like enough ground clearance to hit a curb without damage, not enough low end torque, no \"always on\" power port, poor interior lighting, and no positive surprises in regards to MPG.","251":"Comfortable roomy great storage.","252":"I bought my Ridgeline about 2 months ago when they first came out and I am In Love!!! This is my first truck and 2nd Honda (06 Honda Accord) and I have found the perfect truck for me. I live in the city and just need a truck on weekends and moving stuff once in a while. This is perfect, the Ridgeline is so quiet and drives like a SUV. I sometimes forget that I am driving a truck. Gas is not an issue, I have to fill it up once a week if that. the technology is great. Apple Carplay, Bluetooth, Navigation, rear view and side view cameras, its all there! the Inside is comfortable, quiet and has tons of storage space. When I am stopped at a stop light people stare, so being one of the first to drive around in one of these is pretty cool too. Highly recommend this truck for people like me that dont need a big Truck for their everyday lives but for the people that drive to the office back and forth Monday through Friday but need that extra truck space every once in a while.","253":"The 2017 design is much improved over the earlier Ridgelines.  So far, highway gas mileage is better than 30 mpg. However, city mileage is around 16.5 mpg.   Overall the average mpg meets the sticker numbers.  The big improvement is how quiet this truck is!  I love it.  The RTL-E is really loaded with goodies, with excellent safety improvements.  Really glad I bought one.  Not crazy about the turning radius - hard to pull in to a lot of parking spots without backing up to get centered.  The original horn was so anemic so I got another one installed - a two-town real truck horn instead of a \"meep, meep\" kind of noise.  I wish the back doors would open even 3\" wider.  I'm averaging 21.3 mpg overall, which is a big plus.  I have gotten a number of compliments on the truck.\nI am really enjoying this truck.","254":"The hwy mileage has been as high as 31 mpg.  Mostly at 27 to 29 mpg hwy. Combined mileage 23 to 27.  Way better than my 2006 and 2012 Ridgeline.  I just wish all the RTL models had the sliding rear window.  This model was a great value at $37000. March 2017. Update.  Just took a 5600 mile road trip south and west to Arizona.   Average mileage was 26 mpg. Many speed limits were 80 mph.  Great truck.  Mileage on vehicle now 14000.","255":"This is our 3rd one and it's by far the best , they truly got it right. We test drove the new Chevy and GMC as well as the Toyota , quite frankly there is no comparison in the ride , handling or quietness that this truck provides. It truly presents the perfect combination of the practicality of a truck with the driving comfort and ease of a luxury vehicle. The redesign hit the mark and we could not be more pleased with the truck.","256":"Have had the truck about a week and loving it! Very comfortable ride compared to others with excellent visibility, features and handling. Bought it to use for travel and pulling a lightweight travel trailer. First tank getting us around 26 mpg with mostly highway (secondary) roads. Amazing!","257":"Traded in my 2016 Tacoma TRD-Offroad, Double-Cab, Long-Bed truck to get the new Ridgeline.  I was forced to down-size after moving across the country to a house with a crowded garage.  My F150 just barely fit in our garage and leaving it outside isn't an option due to the brutal sun and hail storms of Colorado.  I had to choose between the Tacoma and the Colorado truck when I down-sized at the time.  Definitely wasn't thrilled with either option, but the Tacoma edged-out the Colorado.  My Tacoma (and the Colorado) have lack-luster acceleration.  Driving the Tacoma to work and back on not-so-wonderful roads was punishing at times.  Sure the Tacoma is a great off-road vehicle, but it needs much better manners to be a daily driver.  I could go on about the Tacoma, but I'll stop here.  The 2017 Ridgeline I was a little skeptical about, but I was really wanting to find a better mid-sized truck option.  When the Ridgeline was available in my area for a test drive I had to try it out.  My wife had a 2013 Honda Pilot that we really liked and I knew this new truck had the latest version of the engine from the Pilot.  Wow! What a difference!   Smooth, quiet, powerful, and much roomier inside the cabin.  My son couldn't sit in the back of my Tacoma as his head would be touching the roof of the cab.  The Ridgeline has plenty of head room for my son and in spite of the really cool stadium rear seating in the Ridgeline, he still has inches of head room to spare.  The Ridgeline has already delivered as high as 30MPG for me on the highway and I can average 25-26MPG in mixed driving (I do use the ECON mode about half the time).  The lowest I've seen it get while driving in the mountains was a tad over 22MPG.  This is using the lower octane gas (85).  The ride is smooth, just a little stiffer than our Pilot due to have a suspension more suitable for a truck.  The handling is awesome.  The AWD and suspension made it a fun vehicle to drive on the twisty mountain roads.  In fact, the AWD is full-time torque-vectoring, very much like what you would get in a Subaru.  Before looking into the Ridgeline, I assumed it would be FWD by default and then the rear wheels kick-in when needed, but not so...  We will be pulling a camping trailer later with the Ridgeline (probably one that weighs around 3200lbs as the max towing capacity is 5000lbs, also a trailer brake controller will be installed on the Ridgeline) and I will report on how that goes.   The only thing about the Ridgeline that I find a little annoying is that the brake peddle is a little mushier than what I'm used to.  BTW...this truck is fast and highly responsive!","258":"I previously owned the 2007 version of this truck. When I purchased that truck in 2012 I paid 19K and I sold it for 10K (4 years later) after putting 65K miles on it. That is an amazingly low annual cost. I had absolutely no issues with the previous version. Needless to say, I put a lot of miles on my car and I wanted better gas mileage and something I knew would last me a long time so I looked at the new version. I also loved the versatility of the Ridgeline and the very good road manners. The improvements are perfect. I absolutely love the option to turn off a few cylinders and go into \"eco\" mode. I even got 30 MPG wile taking a road trip! My average over the first 2200 miles has been a very respectable 23 MPG. I love the technology and all the bells and whistles, which is why I opted for the Black Edition. So far, I have appreciated the lane departure and front collision warning, but I am still getting used to the beeping when I get close to things. One benefit of the beeping is that when someone walks in front of your car while you are stopped but looking the other way, you hear it! My kids have loved the Apple Carplay and completely taken over the music which sounds incredible in this truck. They also love the truck-bed audio system and controlling it from their phone through bluetooth. I thought I would miss the CD player, but I discovered that I can put a bunch of mp3 files on a memory stick and it will play it. My biggest compliment to this new version is the ride comfort and quality. Clearly Honda made very significant improvements to the sound dampening because it is very quiet in the cabin even at freeway speeds. Everything feels quicker and more nimble. The engine has lots of power especially when eco mode is off. I have not towed anything yet with this new one, but I did completely fill the bed and the interior and while the suspension felt a little softer, it was still very secure. The previous version was very solid towing (it felt like a full sized SUV towing) The headlights are amazing, I can see things clearly at night. I was also so amazed when the brights turned off automatically when I was driving on a country road at night and there was an oncoming car. Yes, the controls for the touchscreen take a little while to get used to, but I actually appreciated that some of the features and settings were limited to when I was not driving so as to not distract the driver. Now that I am used to them I appreciate them, but I do think a physical lever or button for sound would be nice beyond the steering wheel controls. I really like the red accents and lighting but in all honesty, I was disappointed that in this top of the line black edition the red lighting was only in the front seat-wells and door handles and there were none for the back seats. The interior has good quality and soft materials. I did notice that the access to the back seats through the doors is a little less on this new model. Not a big deal but getting bigger things into the back seat is a little more challenging. I really like the new exterior styling, very sleek. While not an overly rugged looking truck, it appeals to me because it looks sophisticated and at home in the city which is where I do the majority of my driving. I do not consider myself an off-roader but I did take this new truck out on the beach and tested out the \"sand mode\" and it performed with flying colors. My previous version was simply stunning in the snow so I expect the same with this generation. No deals to be had at the dealership, at least not yet while demand is high and inventory is low. I had to drive an hour and a half away to find a dealership with this one in stock. Overall, I believe that Honda took the best parts of the Ridgeline (ride quality, performance, versatility, features) and improved each one significantly. They also fixed my biggest complaint with the previous version (16 mpg  average in mixed driving). I also fit the demographic Honda was targeting very well: mostly city driver, rarely tows\/hauls\/offroads but wants the versatility only a truck can provide while also wanting the comfort of an SUV. Bingo!","259":"Drives like a great car, but is still a truck.","260":"If you go for the top edition which is the black edition, you will be happy at how it looks like a truck and acts like a truck be has a very suv feel to it. Its all wheel drive  and at least 4 traction options. they there is the d4 option adds more capability to the truck. I also like the lighting, parking assist, blind spot asist, lane keeping assist, full voice control of audio and climate control and navigation and phone calls. I do not have to do anything. Hands free finally. I have had Jags, and tundra and jeep commander, bmw and I was shocked to get all this for less than a 3 series BMW. the truck bed is fully protected with a liner. You will never go back. To anything else.","261":"This is a great everyday driver, the ultimate do everything, versatile vehicle.","262":"The truck is great.  Pricey for the features you get.  An RTL has a very basic radio for 37 k.   For that price I expect better amenities so I passed","263":"The interior on the prior models of the Ridgeline are much better.  I own an older model Ridgeline and have been waiting since 2015 for the newer version.  Initially told it was coming in  Jan of 2017. It came out sooner but the interior is a big disappointment.  It looks as if they put in a Honda Odessy front panel so they could get it to market.  I won't buy this current version.  Someone told me Ford is coming out with a truck with a trunk and tailgate like Honda's.  I will have to check it out.  Maybe their interior is better.","264":"It is a very nice truck, Sold my 07 that I liked a lot for this. Was very happy on how much better this truck is.","265":"On our second weekend of ownership, we took the teenage grandsons to Cownans Gap SP in south central Pennsylvania.   Doesn't matter if it's overnight or a week, when camping you have to \"load up\"; and we did including 4 bikes.  The trunk was great, placed backpacks with clothes and bike gear in the water tight cargo space.  Carried 1 bike in the bed and 3 on the hitch mounted rack.   Round Trip  323 miles  of  mountains,  turnpike and secondary roads... 24.0 mpg !  Everyone was comfortable in the cabin;  A\/C  in the front  set at 73;  rear 68.  Storage under the rear seat was invaluable;  no  hump, all  usable space. Downsized from a 2013 Silverado, didn't need the big truck any longer.  The trip proved  it.  Great Ride,  Great Weekend.\n2-18-17  Follow Up:   Truck has been tremendous,  does everything required.   Everyone comments on how much room there is in the back seat.  I have a short 12 mile commute to work, hilly back roads mostly;  getting 18 to 21 mpg.  Downsized from a full size pick up.  Handles great.  No problems in the parking garage.  Really satisfied with purchase;  no buyers remorse.","266":"This is a solid, mid size pickup truck.  It easily hauls anything a larger truck could.  Towing capacity is excellent!  I have towed fully loaded 6 x 12 foot U-haul trailers from my main home to my second home (about 650 miles one way) with my current 2016 and my previous 2012 - both the same model.  Had no issue going up long grades or keeping up with traffic.  The vehicle handles well too - especially in town.  Parking is a breeze and it actually fit in my garage!  Interior trim is what can be expected with a utility type vehicle.  I installed a bed cover and liner and the Weathertech floor mats to protect things.  The controls work as expected and are arranged logically.  The Bluetooth interface with my phone needs some serious work (it always sends \"Im driving\" and I can't use the supposedly built in voice to text feature.  The cruise control is a little laggy when in hilly terrain, letting the vehicle slow too much at a transition from downhill to uphill.  Handling is excellent.  I had a 2016 F150 for 4000 miles - could not drive it on the curvy roads in Tennessee and it bounced around quite a bit on the highway.  Went back to the Frontier for the handling and utility of the vehicle.  I will purchase another when this one wears out.","267":"Nothing fancy, but a solid, inexpensive ride. Place the grandboys in the crew cab and have an adventure.","268":"I have a 2016 King Cab S with the 5-speed manual transmission and \"preferred package\" which includes cruise-control, bluetooth and not much else. The price I got for this truck was excellent and I wanted a fairly simple truck. This is a pretty bare-bones truck and if you go into knowing that, then you won't be disappointed. I liked that the windows (on this trim level) are hand-operated. The transmission is easy to shift, the clutch has a nice long travel with easy modulation. The truck is solid, secure and can tow 3500 lbs. with the factory bumper hitch.  The manual climate control is effective and fast, fairly quiet and about as easy to operate a they come. I really only have to things I would change if I could, but I'm not unhappy. The platform for this truck is ancient in car years. As such, the technology for the engine is old. Mileage is poor for a truck this size, though I haven't finished the break-in period. I am getting about 23mpg in high-speed highway and mixed city driving. Second, the audio system has bluetooth, but you cannot play music through it. It is only for phone connectivity.  Otherwise, I do really love this truck and am glad I traded off my 2013 Focus for it.","269":null,"270":"the desert runner is a very nice truck all the way around I am very happy with everything it has to offer","271":"The gas mileage is not so good.  Don't take possession of the truck until it has everything that you ordered, and is in good condition ie: no scratches, or dents. Also make sure that the floor mats are new & not used. I've owned the truck now for 6 months , and the mileage is still poor, but the comfort, reliability are excellent. The acceleration is not great, but highway cruising is very good.","272":"best value in class","273":"I will be honest... Before I bought my Frontier I was dead set on a new Tacoma, even though I didn't really like the new body style.  Way too much going on. However, I test drove one thinking that I could look past the \"looks.\"  Long story short, I did not like the truck.  Plus there are so many complaints about the transmission shifting erratically.  So I went across the street to the Nissan dealership and test drove the Frontier and fell in love with it.  Really.  I love the way it looks, drives and it was $10k less than a new Tacoma.  I really like that all of the bugs have been worked out of the truck, because it hasn't had a major update in 10 years.  Some will complain about the gas mileage, or that the interior feels cheap, or needs an update, etc..  I am happy with the gas mileage... I didn't buy a Prius.  Its a truck and its a truck with a pretty stout engine for it's size.  I am happy with the interior.  It is simple, like a truck should be, yet it does have bluetooth and Sirius which are useful, without being over complicated.  Anyway, I wish I could afford to buy two of them, because I really like this version of the Frontier and I am scared that Nissan will \"over\" update their next iteration of this truck.  Don't do what I almost did and fall for the Tacoma hype and pay MSRP or over for a truck with documented automatic transmission problems.","274":"Okay little truck, but the 4 cylinder engine was a disappointment, it lacks in power and gives me about the same Mileage as my old 2000 Nissan Frontier 6 cylinder standard transmission did. The truck I bought is bear-bones with crank windows and manual door locks, wish I had upgraded, but the price was the reason for the lesser truck.","275":"Extensive online research.  Disappointed in online shopping experience (get a quote should be titled get emails asking you to stop by - no quotes).  Once selected visited dealership and got exactly what I wanted for what I wanted to pay (trade-in value for my old vehicle was higher than expected). Update (after 6 months) - little noisy at highway speeds and the shift points take some getting used to. That said, I'd buy it again.","276":"Several packages over and above Std Crew Cab with 5 foot bed. Head restraints on back seats block 2\/3rds of rearview mirror.  I removed the head restraints to have full view of rear of truck.  GPS\/Navigation comes as a premium.  You can have GPS with custom mount for a lot less money and viewing the GPS is just off your right side of the steering wheel  at the 2 o'clock position.  I have used my TomTom 5\/7\" on the last 4 Nissan Frontier Trucks with the same custom mount to the dashboard through the top vent of the left A\/C vent.  The custom mount goes with me on each sale.  V6 Engine provides plenty of power when needed on the highway or on a city street.  I purchased separately a custom bed cover which enhances the gas mileage about 3% and completes the trim of the back of the truck.  Also keeps the storage area dry.  The bed extender attached to the inside of the bed with side & floor tracks with cleats has always been a must for the truck bed.  I am 6'4\" the Frontier offers plenty of leg room and head room.  So look over the various features and comfort packages to get what you need.","277":"There are a lot of \"PROS\" with this truck. (The biggest one for me was the amazing price that found - couldn't pass it up...).  Aside from that, I a very happy with this pickup.  the cabin is quiet, and it is very stable on the road, even a highway speeds here in Kansas (80+) with wind that can be brutal and sustained... I haven't felt like I was being blown around too much.  I added a tonneau bed cover and it helped the stability a lot, which surprised me.  Braking is very good, I have had to engage the ABS one time already... when a car pulled over on me in city traffic.           If I am picky, there are a few negatives, however.   The first is the overall cabin room, which I would expect to be similar in other models - it took a little getting used to...  I don't notice it any more, but at first  felt a little cramped - and wished that the seat would push back further.  The other letdown was the mileage.  I have averaged 19 mpg, which is mostly highway.   I had hoped with a 6 cylinder that I would be in the low to mid 20's... Overall I am very happy with this truck.  I upgraded the factory speakers - I am an audiophile though - so that was important to me.   I also added Raptor chrome step bars so my daughter and fianc\u00e9e can get in more easily (both are around 5'3\").  It would have been unnecessary for me though.   I also have towed a trailer with a car on it for about 50 miles, with absolutely no problems.     It doesn't accelerate like my last car (2006 GTO) - but then, what could??  Ha Ha.","278":"Tried out Tacoma (did not like ride and vis ability), Colorado.  Liked Frontier best of all three at about 5K less money.  Fuel economy was a concern. However, first two fill-ups 19 plus mpg...I'm happy.","279":"You can't beat this truck! Thousands less than its competitors, it outperforms them in almost every category. Trade-in value is outstanding also!","280":"Only 600 miles but seems to be very solid. Quiet, comfortable, good performance (wish the gas mileage was a bit better), comfortable, priced very well.","281":"This is 4 wheel vehicle #33 (+12 motorcycles).   Last truck was 2009 Toyota Tacoma standard cab 4WD (good truck).   Last full size truck was Dodge Ram 1500 standard cab 2WD 5.7 hemi (great acceleration).   Typical commute to ranch is 220 miles, but last 8 miles are rocky road and last 3\/4 mile is Jeep trail.   \nWife and I are EXTREMELY satisfied.\n   \nMileage from west end of Glacier National Park to east end and return was 23.73!   Mileage from Las Vegas Valley to Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada and back was 20.56, which included substantial 80 MPH speed limits.   Around town mileage is rated 15 MPG and that is what we get, if only town (not typical).   Combined is about 17.5 MPG.   \n\nLow RPM torque is excellent.   Pulls grades on I40, east of Kingman, AZ mainly in 5th gear at 75 MPH.   \n\nWish bed light had auto\/on\/off switch instead of auto with any door opening.   Turning radius is not the best, but no worse than wife's former 2004 GMC Sonoma crew cab 4WD.\n\nWife likes (a) 8 cup holders, (b) upper and lower glove box, (c) wide door pockets and (d) comfortable ride, although it does sidestep around curves over bumps, due to higher profile tires (which we like for going over rocks).   \n\nIn addition to torque\/acceleration, I like under rear seat storage for tools, tow strap, jumper cables, tie downs, etc and room behind back seat for jacket, thin backpack, as well as factory jack and tire tools.   Instruments do not need an operation manual to quickly understand.   Battery and air filter easy to access.   10\" ground clearance on 4WD. \n\nOther than a new 92 Nissan Sentra GXE, my only other Nissan was a new 1973 Datsun PL620 P\/U.   In 1982 I put a Chevrolet 350 V-8 in it with a 500 CFM Carter AFB on an SP2P Edlebrock manifold, hooker headers, dual exhausts, Chevrolet turbo350 auto trans and a shortened\/resplined 2.92:1 differential (for traction).   \n\nThis factory Frontier is almost as much fun!...and it has 4WD and aairconditioning.   - SportsterDoc","282":"This is a solid truck.  Heavy truck for mid size.  Handles well when driving and going around turns it really hugs the road, feels great to drive.  Owned a Toyota Tacoma before but didn't have as much power and felt lighter and didn't handle the best when going around turns.","283":"This vehicle, a 2016 Frontier SV does not have automatic headlights. Almost every truck does. The LED screen is just 5 inches when most trucks are eight inches or more.  Very stiff ride, which I like. Dealer was excellent. Second Nissan Frontier that I have owned.","284":"Fuel mileage poor.","285":"This is my seventh Nissan Frontier and they are the hardest working little trucks you can buy. Although it is a good-looking truck ,they are rugged hard-working little trucks too. I work in construction and use mine for hauling drywall, tools and trailers every day. With a half ton payload and 6000 pounds hauling  capability I regularly carry large load up and down the hills of West Virginia! I have been pleased with every truck I have owned from Nissan clear back when they were still Datsun trucks.  I normally put 25 to 35,000 miles a year on these trucks and they require very little maintenance and hold up well to my abuse! I use mine as a tool - and I love my new hammer!","286":"I bought this truck because I wanted a 4x4 midsize truck that would fit in my garage without paying 35+ thousand dollars. It is a nice, reliable truck that is fairly comfortable in the front and I like the heated cloth seats. I drove 1000 miles straight thru and had no problems. However, the back seats are terrible and I would feel sorry for anyone who has to ride in the back. Luckily, I am generally the only one in it so for me it isn't a problem. The infotainment system is ok, but not great. I have trouble with the primary apps (Pandora and Iheart Radio) dropping off occasionally and the speakers aren't great. It has dual climate control which I love. I also like the value package that came with the truck that allows for tying down cargo in the bed, along with the bed extender. My biggest and loudest complaint is the awful, terrible gas mileage. The truck has plenty of power, which is nice, but it is at the expense of gas mileage. There are full-size trucks out there that get way better fuel economy. In all, it is a nice reliable truck. I like it and would recommend it, but just understand what your getting. I am leasing this for another 1 1\/2 yrs and will probably let it go primarily because of the gas mileage. However, if they can improve on the fuel economy before my lease is up then I would have no problem getting another one, because it is a nice truck otherwise.","287":"So far I love this truck.  I have only had it a month and I love the way it drives and handles the road.  If I had to give a negative, the navigation system is a little bit lacking and subpar to say a store bought dash GPS.Other than that, Great Truck!!!","288":"Traded my 2009 dodge ram in for the 2016 Nissan frontier pro4x. I AM LOVE ! I have been looking for a new vehicle because my dodge literally was crumbling in front of me. Thought about going for the new Tacoma, but I didn't like that it was the first run of the \" completely renewed Tacoma \" so I went for the frontier. The thought of it not being changed since 2004 really grabbed my attention as they hold their value so well. I owned a 2006 jeep wrangler before my dodge and I would say the frontier drives super similar to how the older jeeps drove, which is why I fell in love with the pro4x. If you want a solid riding, reliable truck, then I say go for the frontier.","289":"My new 2016 Frontier is missing a bunch of padding near the backrest in the drivers seat. Feels like you are sitting in a hole and hurts my back.  Nissan is not willing to replace or repair the seat. Passengers seat has the padding and is comfortable. 100% dissatisfied with Nissan Customer Service. I purchased a new 2011 Frontier and was very happy with the truck, so purchased a new 2016 exact copy. Both driver and passenger seats on the 2011 were identical and comfortable.   After dealing with Nissan Customer Service, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN PRODUCT! The dealer and Nissan indicated they would write no more repair\/complaints. So much for the LEMON LAW!","290":"To further update my Frontier...\nStill going strong. I took it to Washington in the Cascade Mtns during a snow storm.\nIt was a little squirrelly to drive.\nWhile I was thrre, I purchased new tire chains for my semi truck, so I put about 400 lbs in the bed.\nNot sure footed, but not squirrelly either.  A set of tire cables did the trick.  Not very happy with the paint quality, despite wax and polish, a stiff breeze scratches it.\nThe truck is definitely not lacking in power, and has straight up beaten my Siverado in straight line acceleration.  The odd thing is, they both average 21 mpg.\nSilverado: 8 cylinders, 5.3 liter, 4wd, crew cab, mostly highway driving.\nFrontier: 6 cylinders, 4 liter, rwd, Desert Runner crew cab, with 30\/70 city\/highway driving.\nI have been told that the rear seat is very uncomfortable to sit in, and both people likened the seat to a folding chair. \nMy wife says it rides like a buckboard, and runs like her Maxima.  She actually will drive it, where as \"The Behemoth\"\n (her pet name for my Silverado)\nShe will not drive.  As a happy Nissan customer for years, I will be buying another in the future.\nBeen eyeing the new XD. \n\nI'm a pretty big guy.  6'4\/ 260 lbs.  I traded up for my 2009 king cab 2.4 liter manual transmission.  Got the price I wanted.  I was able to find a Desert Runner, in Silver with the hokey decals already removed.  Maybe I'm used to semi truck brakes, but I have no trouble stopping my Frontier.  I expect the audio system to go first.  My wife's second Maxima is the only one (out of six) that didn't fail.  I question Nissan's\nInterior color choices, and the materials seem flimsy, but they are very durable.\nIf you want fluff and gadgetry, look elsewhere.  If you want a solid, well  made, Reliable and durable car, buy a Nissan.  I have owned Nissan since 1987,  All went 120k miles problem free and I know two of the six are still being driven by our children. I currently own two Chevrolets that I can't say the same about.   Can't buy a comparable well made vehicle for the same price.","291":"This is a nice mid sized truck, however the brake pedal is very sponge and goes down almost to the floor.  We checked with the service manager and said the brakes are designed that way.  Also I felt the controls were confusing, remembering I did not have a chance to really study them.  I'll keep my Silverado.","292":"Recently I purchased a new Nissan Frontier SV King Cab with the 4.0 V6 automatic, and I really like it. For about two years prior to my purchase, I considered the Frontier as well as the Toyota Tacoma and to a lesser extent the Chevy Colorado. There are several reasons why I chose the Frontier over the Tacoma or Colorado. Among those reasons is way it drives; the Frontier handles very well and feels very solid on the road. The interior and seating position felt more \"right\" to me than its competitors. In my opinion, the Frontier's exterior looks much better than the Tacoma and even the Colorado. Finally, for the money, I believe I got a much better deal with the Frontier, paying thousands of dollars less for what I would have paid for similar features in its competitors.\n\nI have owned other pickups in the past, including a Mazda pickup, an older Toyota pickup, and a Ford Ranger, and in my opinion the Nissan Frontier is clearly the best of them all, even though it is really not fair to compare this Frontier to the older trucks. While this particular version of the Frontier has been around for more than a decade, it is still very up-to-date. My truck has Bluetooth, XM Radio, a USB jack, and apps available in the entertainment system. \n\nSo far, I have hauled several loads and towed a small utility trailer with no problems at all. I am very satisfied with the Frontier and would without hesitation recommend it to others.","293":"I set out to buy a Tacoma, but several factors set my decision on the Frontier. First The Dealer \"Sparks\" was as useless as a three legged horse. No help on the trade of my 2013 Prius that had hail damage. and the cost of the Tacoma was going to cost me more that 5K than the better equipped Frontier. SV Package included Tow PKG, Extend a bed Dual control Heat\/AC, Heated Seats, Auto Dim Mirror with thermometer and compass built in fabric seats etc. The ride is much better than my Prius noisewise and comfort wise, The acceleration is excellent and the steering seems nice and tight. The Dealer \"Grand Strand Nissan\" and the sales and management were excellent. They offered more than 5k on my trade  than the Toyota was willing to give. I noticed a superficial scratch on the tail gate spoiler and mentioned it to my sales agent and the shop manager came out looked and said we'll replace it without a problem. I could have lived with it but being a new truck I was happy they offered. Great overall experience","294":"Having owned many Rangers, (which were very strong tough trucks) the Nissan Frontier is by far the better truck. Very strong frame, very solid riding. The engine, V-6  strong, plenty of torque. The price advantage is excellent. A similar equipped Toyota Tacoma will list for apron $4.000 more.","295":"After one year, I opened the door for the cabin filter and 1) the latch broke, and 2) there were no cabin filters installed.   Really had to save a nickle and leave out two paper filters?   Not impressed.","296":"I've had the 2016 rental 3 weeks while my car is getting repaired from an accident.  I enjoy driving the truck as it has plenty of power and handles very well, but the mileage is nowhere near its EPA rating.  I'm getting only 12-15 mpg with 2\/3rd of more of my driving on highways.  A lot of full size trucks do better.  What really surprised me is the lack of small features I've grown accustomed to in my GM vehicles.  The lights are manual - you have to turn them on and off.  C'mon!  I had a 2003 Chevy S10 pickup (base work truck model) that had automatic lights.  This Frontier is a loaded model and it doesn't have this feature.  It also lacks a vehicle travel computer showing instantaneous and average speeds and gasoline consumption, miles until empty, etc., nor an outside temperature readout.  I read through the manual to find out if they are hidden behind some function on the radio\/info center.  Every GM vehicle I've had since 2007 has all these as standard on every model and trim level.  Also, it didn't have the rear camera, though the manual indicated some models have it.  I expected it on a loaded 4wd full cab 4x4.  Again, a feature that GM is making standard on all vehicles.","297":"I'll keep this short. Needed a truck to replace my 2001 Ford Ranger 4x4 and this truck appeared to fit that need. Negotiated for a good price and road tested it on local roads, less than 50mph. It handled ok. What a surprise though when driving on highway or any back roads that are posted 50 plus that have curves. You'll need to work that steering wheel to keep the truck on line. I drive school buses, flat noses and conventional, and they handle 10 times better than this truck. Fortunately  for me most, not all,, is local driving. If your thinking about buying this truck, road tested it like no other vehicle you've bought before.","298":"I originally bought a 2015 SV V6 2WD King Cab (in May 2015).  After using it for 6 months it became obvious there was not enough room in the cab when I needed to carry passengers.  I was also a little disappointed with the lack of features I have become accustomed to in my new vehicles - heated  seats, compass, outside temp, rear camera............\n\nWhile the reviews of this 2015 vehicle were not outstanding, I was happy (overall) with my truck.  It was fairly noisy, but it fit my expectations of a truck.  (I want to be able to carry stuff, with reasonable expectations for performance and reliability.)\n\nSo after getting a reluctant nod from my wife, I bought the same truck as a 2016 (November 2015).  However, this time it was a 4 door SV with the value truck package.\n\nThis version is much more usable, with less road noise. Gas mileage is not outstanding, but it's not rediculous (as you might expect from the reviews).  I get 20 mpg consistently (combined). The features and controls work well, and are simple to use.  However, they may be somewhat dated in their design.  Again they honestly meet my expectations for a truck.\n\nI did look at the new Chevy when I bought the 2015.  The dealers were unwilling to negotiate on the price, and there were few vehicles available on the lot.  There were no Toyota's available in a 2WD, and the dealers were even less willing to negotiate about the price. \n\nTo be honest, I may be unlike many who want a pick-up.  I'd really prefer a small\/mid pick-up that would be based on a small SUV.  This would likely improve gas mileage, and address the main reason I have a pick-up.  Did I mention I want to have the ability to carry stuff......  \n\nI am not a farmer or tradesman, so I don't need all the bulk and capacity of a real pick-up.  I use this vehicle to go to work, shopping, and just general transportation.\n\nGiven the 3 small trucks currently available in the market, I think the 4 door Frontier is a competent choice.  It doesn't seem to have any of the concerns noted in many of the customer reviews for the new GM's or Toyota, and the gas milage is not significantly different.","299":"In May, 1017, I traded my Nisson truck in on a 2016 Honda CRV.  I have arthritis in my back, hip, & shoulders so it became more difficult to raise & lower the tailgate & bed cover.","300":"the trucks have a problem. my truck, without warning, a 2016 Colorado 4 cyclinder rpms raise to 2200 rpm as you stop. to keep it from surging forward and hitting someone you have to put it in neutral and then the rpms run up to 3000rpms. once it went to 4000 rpms. dealer hasn't got a clue, said it possibly could be part of the hill assist and if it's that then there's nothing they can do. took it two times to the dealer. Now you're coming to a stop and you don't know when it's going to do it. I have to keep my hand on the shifter to push it in neutral before I hit someone in a crosswalk or hit a car stopped in front of me.","301":"In the review options it did not let me select the 2.8L Duramax Diesel as my engine, that is what I have. If you're on the fence regarding buying something smaller and more efficient as opposed to a full size truck I think this is likely your best choice. My truck has been modified since purchasing so I'll stick to the factory stock experience. First and fore most, mid-size trucks have come a long way since the mid 2000's. Fuel efficiency wise I have seen generally around 24mpg city and as high as 34mpg hwy over a 50mi stretch. I am 72\" on the dot and can fit comfortably in the front and squeeze into the rear seats(probably wouldn't be super comfy for those over 72\" for long trips). The power lumbar support is amazing as are the heated seats (they warm up faster and stay hotter than the ones in my 2016 Corvette). The first thing I noticed driving the truck at the dealer is how nimble it feels and how quiet and smooth the power delivery is. You almost forget its a diesel. The Chevrolet Infotainment system is likely one of the best on the market as far as ease of use and a logical layout. Apple carplay and the voice activated controls\/navigation make commutes a breeze. I've driven this truck in heavy snow and ice here in Eastern Washington and had zero issues. I was able to recover\/tow about 10 peoples cars off of hills in a 2-3 month span just commuting to and from work. I've towed several times with it and had zero issues. Lastly, this truck is an absolute head turner. I've had more people ask me questions about it at stop lights than I ever did in my Corvette. My only real complaint is that the bolsters on the seats are a little narrow for me. Anyone under 72\" and 200lbs will likely be just fine.","302":"Let me start off this review by telling you this is the worst GM has to offer their customers. lf they were looking to drive their customers to Toyota or some other manufacture, they have succeeded. Below is a list of complaints and issues that GM fails to resolve.1. Poor Customer Service by Manufacturer.  2. Hood Flutter at Highway Speed.  3. Climate Control Noisy and Useless.  4. Terrible Upshift and Downshift Quality.  5.Brakes Clunk.  6. Truck has a 1\" plus Lean to Driver Side.  7. Poor Body Panel fit.  8. Useless Headlight design. 9. Terrible Power Range. 10. Longevity.  This truck will be lucky to last the warranty period.","303":"Within a few weeks after purchasing, I took this truck back to the dealer for bad hesitation problems.  In town, after turning a corner at low speeds the truck would hesitate like it did not know if it should increase fuel or down shift.  Cruising at around 40 MPH it would do the same thing.  At highway speeds it would do the same thing.  The only way to get the truck moving again was to MAKE it down shift.  Some times it downshifts two gears.  I found that I have to be really careful on wet roads and loose gravel.  The sudden downshifts would make the rear tires spin.  I consider this an extreme SAFETY HAZARD.  After numerous calls and emails to Chevrolet CustomerCare I was finally told that they would do NOTHING to help my situation and to take it take it up with the purchasing dealer.   Seven trips back to the dealer and now, they tell me they can not fix it.  The dealer did offer to trade it for a new 2017, but it turned out to be a good trade for the dealer, but a terrible deal for me.  Lemon law or lawsuit?  I cannot afford a lawyer, so I guess Lemon Law.............","304":"Poor storage in side doors, not able to place anything under rear seats, but has a very small area if you lift the back seat. Really need more room between the front seats and the door panels. Have the main instrument panel go blank most every day. When it goes dead can't change any settings, If radio is on, cant change even the volume. It comes on when it wants to and goes dead the same way.  Can't select nav or anything when it is dead. Dealer has not found any reason for it to do what it does. I consider this a real safety issue, no nav., out outside temp. and so on. It could say blank for 30 to 40 minutes, sometimes less. This is on 2016 model with 22,000 miles. Looking to get rid of it if it can't be fixes.","305":"My son just turned 16, and we wanted something special for him to have. We felt the Silverado would be too big; however, the Colorado fits the bill. I must say that we have not been too impressed with road handling ,  but then again, that is not why you buy a vehicle of this type. I find it to be a bit expensive for what you receive. However, nothing beats the excitement on my son's face upon being handed the keys.","306":"Sprung for the Diesel even though it was an expensive option. Well worth it. It sounds great and very smooth. Averaging 25 around town, 33 HWY. Turns heads for sure. This truck has a superior ride quality and a very quite cabin. The Bose sound system doesn't get any better.  Love this Truck!","307":"I purchased this truck used with 11,000 miles as a work Truck.  I am in the piano repair business so I needed something with good fuel economy that can tow a trailer with pianos as well.   In the first 2000 miles of use over a 3 week period with a combination of highway, city and towing once a week I've averaged 27.2 miles to the gallon.  The truck is comfortable and I spend allot of time driving New England.  In addition, it tows my box trailer thus far with up to 2 grand pianos at a time without issue.  It actually feels more comfortable towing than my 98 Tahoe did.  The 2.8 diesel has as much torque as the V8 did but the output happens at a lower RPM so the motor does not feel like it is working very hard.   The bed is large enough for my needs carrying a few tool boxes as well as using the space for grand and upright parts including actions and keybeds for transport to the shop.   In addition I installed a plastic folder cover to keep the cargo secure from weather.  It also can be removed for the occasional piano move where it is easier to get the truck into a yard without the trailer.   The electronics with the GPS and blue tooth connection for the phone or other devices such as a ipod all work great.  My last Chevy I had for close to 18 years hopefully this one will hold up as well.   The diesel is what made it for me.   My experience with mid size V6 motors is that the fuel economy combined is not really that great and the motors tend to not do as well for towing, particularly on longer runs.   This vehicle allows me to own only one that I can use for service calls, with all my tools and have room to easily transport piano parts.   In addition it tows a trailer effortlessly.   Finally 27.2 miles combined for all of this is rather remarkable.  Remember the truck weighs over 5000 lbs.   Finally the \"jake break\" works great.   A flip of the switch allows you to slow down with the diesel motor and transmission putting less stress on the breaking system.   Except for the heavier feel of the truck its hard to tell you have a trailer on.","308":"You will not regret this purchase. The fuel economy his not what I expected, but the rest of the 2016 Colorado's features more than make up for that. I'm very pleased with the ride, which is better than some cars. I would recommend this truck to anyone.","309":"I've had my 2016 for about 16 months now and really have no major complaints.  This is my first truck.  Ride, handling, and acceleration are all very good, especially the solid road feel.  This handles as well or better than any car I've previously owned.  Interior amenities are plentiful, I especially like having Apple CarPlay.  Gas mileage is averaging in the low 20's.  I've had no mechanical issues other than recall work.  Steps are a must-add accessory.  I have the leather seat package and have had no complaints, the seat heaters are really nice to have in colder weather.  There are a few minor annoying nits though: The door storage is largely unusable.  There are no rear-seat A\/C vents.  There's no home-link for opening the garage door.  It could use LED lights as well.  Overall though, I completely enjoy the truck.  In most cases it rides like a car, though when I need to tow or haul, it's there for me as well.  I'd buy another Colorado again in a heart-beat.","310":"This truck does everything I want it to do and more! This truck gets me up a mountain to go hunting on the weekend and is a smooth ride throughout the work week. I feel like I got a lot of features and functionality for the price. Technology on the inside is great. Styling on the outside turnes heads. The v6 has plenty of acceleration and power. I have owned 2 tocomas, but this new colorado is the best truck I've ever had.","311":"My truck drives and handle very well, however it spent a numbers of shorts and long stays in the shop. The last two weeks in for a rear end overhaul . I think my truck is from hell ,after all I been thru. I have a 2016 crew cab, with 14250 miles. My advice do not buy.","312":"I purchased the extended cab Colorado in September 2016, I am very happy with this truck.  I have owned Chevrolet 1500's, GMC 2500 HD's, Ford F150, Chevrolet Blazers, this is just as good if not better.    The Colorado is driven daily, ride is good, , mileage is good,  style is great.  Well worth the price.","313":"Looked at MANY trucks before making this purchase.  Almost got a 2016 Tacoma, but didn't like the tight interior (since I have a tall hubby and big teenage boys).  Former Silverado owner, but didn't want the big version the Silverado has become.                                                                                                                                                                      In short, I LOVE this truck,owned it almost a year - It rides comfortably, has great tech features (apple car play, Nav, etc...), and looks SHARP (I went with dark Rainforest Green with dark tinted windows...).   I love the steps built into the bumper, and the ease of getting up\/down to load bikes, kayaks, whatever.                                Now, the honest cons:  Hoped for better gas mileage with a V6 (average is 22.1, mostly highway driving).  From 0 to 20 mph  when you push the pedal, it hesitates, then takes off easily at about 30 mph.  Not sure why.  Pedal seems hard to push at times, somewhat unresponsive.  My hubby has noticed this too.  The truck is a bit hard for me to get out of (shorter guys too) - I have to \"slide\" out, and I do have the side steps.  Something about the design is a bit off (I didn't have this problem in my Silverado), but I'm young enough to cope with it easily.  What I am most bothered by is the lack of a flat floor when the back seats are up for cargo.  There are storage bins under the seat, but it makes putting things I don't want to get rained on difficult - including having my dog, groceries, or luggage back there.  It's just awkward.  I've had to resort to leaving the back seats down, and using a blanket to protect them.  All in all, I'm very happy with the truck, but it would be really nice to have some flat floor space in the cab area.","314":"I love the size of my truck, easy to park and drive. I've had 3 Silverados and I don't miss hunting for parking spots big enough. The Apple car play is a game changer, there is no need for ever buying navigation on the next car.  Best seat heaters ever, lov the remote start. I have a friend that only drives Mercedes benz, love busting his chops on the fact his $65,000 car doesn't have remote start.","315":"Broke down twice the first two days due to battery. Has stalled a couple times at red light and to this day still feels like it wants to stall. Transmission has issues that nobody can seem to fix. Has been in shop for these issues numerous times and still have problems with only 10k miles on it.","316":"I seemed to get more for the money than I would have gotten from Nissan for their Frontier. My lease was less money and I got more options. The acceleration was better in the Nissan but the Colorado gave me more options in the vehicle. I was surprised by this since I had leased many vehicles from Nissan in the past but Chevy seemed more willing to get to my price point so they got my business. I am pretty happy so far. The vehicle drives smooth and seems to be solid. It has only been a few weeks so the honeymoon is still going on. Time will tell.","317":"Colorado 2.8 DIESEL 4x4 is fast. Def is cheap for exhaust I went to test drive and can't believe I spent $36,000 {list $40,000}that day with a 2.3% loan. It has the safety option which keeps an eye on my driving. $399 Recommend Have driven 3800+ miles and have watched all the digital views {Great}. Back roads 65 MPH 31.8 MPG with 4x4. All around 24.8 MPG since some 80 MPH on interstate  I pull a 20' Hurricane. I traded a 2007 HHR with 98,000 never a problem and sold my 2004 trailblazer that got 15 mpg with 193,000 never a problem with engine or trans but rusted brake lines relaced for $920","318":"First off, I'm a guy that uses a truck.  I've had many, and buy them for actual work...home and\/or towing.  Last truck (the one I traded in on this puppy) was a 2012 GMC Sierra X-Cab set up for towing a travel trailer.  We are pausing the camping \/ trailer duty, but I still need a truck.  Didn't want the full size version.     In short, this is a great medium sized truck.  Wish it was a bit smaller, lower, but overall it fits me well.   A trip to Chicago from Peoria got me 22 MPG.   That's not the trip computer, that's old fashioned miles divided by gallons method.   It is fairly comfy, roomy, and love the 7,000 lb tow rating for the V6.  Here are the negs:  The 305 claimed HP is only at the very top of the RPM range.  Trucks should have grunt....I'd happily give up MPG for more grunt.  The engine feels weak until you lay in it, but even then its kinda numb.  The transmission shifts fine....I know others complain about it hunting gears...and it does.  But I mostly drive it like a car, even when towing a utility trailer, so I've not had quite the issues others had.  Again, I'd pay more and sacrifice MPG if the XSMN held gears longer, and the engine had more grunt, but it works \"okay\" as is.    Biggest complaint:  The worthless infotainment system.  In IL, it is illegal to use a cell phone while driving.  Yet, I can nearly hit a pole while trying to figure out how to change a radio station.  I dislike touch screens to the fullest.  My phone has bluetooth, but will not pair with the radio.  Guess what?  TOO COMPLICATED.   I prefer a good CD player....and they offer none in this truck.  I knew this going in.  Why do new cars \/ trucks think we need a complicated device in the dash to distract us from a simple station change....done in the past via moving your arm and doing it by feel.  No longer!   Now, use a touch screen, which has no feel, to go thru menus.  Painfully stupid.    I sound negative, but in reality I really like the truck.  I've used it as a truck and will continue to do so.  And, it hauls my kids.  Looks good doing it.  Engine and trans are fine...and will be better when I install a custom tune to hold gears longer and adjust a few things.  Radio (I just can't call it infotainment) works, and music on USB sticks is okay, but not the same as CD's.   I got a great deal on closeout '16's which is why I have the Z71 over the lesser models with more normalized radio.    $5,400 off sticker just for walking in.  BOTTOM LINE:  I bought this over the Tacoma due to towing capacity and rebates \/ price.","319":"So far so good, only problem is paint chipping on edges of doors, of course they say it must have hit something but it hasn't","320":"I'm a sales manager for a Chevy Buick gmc store in Colorado this might be best all around truck built today","321":"[UPDATE] I purchased my Duramax Colorado in May 2016 and have 34,400 miles on it. Fuel economy is holding around 27-29 for average city driving and low 30's on the highway. At 65mph on cruise control, the truck averages 42mpg over distances. \n\nI still love this truck and had to purchase an extended warranty because I'm almost out of the standard 36k bumper-to-bumper. \n\nIt's a great truck and I get excited to see other diesel Colorados on the street.","322":"Gets 30MPG","323":"Listen, I have no complaints about the mechanical functionality of this truck. In fact, I think it's great as far as that is concerned. My caveat is if you are buying the laser blue color truck, be very careful. When you look at all the pictures of the laser blue on the Chevrolet website, it definitely appears as a terrific and great looking blue. Even in person  at the dealership at night, or on a cloudy day, or if the sun angle is shining just right it will also appear to be the same terrific blue. What you might not realize though, is that this blue quickly turned to Barney purple with a 45 degree  change in light refraction. This laser blue color is an un advertised two tone paint scheme. Sometimes it will look totally purple, and sometimes it will look the prettiest magnificent electric blue you have ever seen. Just don't get duped.  Chevrolet makes no effort in the vehicle specs to describe this two-tone paint scheme.  And all of the pictures on the Chevrolet website show the truck is a beautiful blue. And if you go to the dealership at night or on a cloudy day, you will not see it either.  Chevy even calls this color \"laser blue\". I believe this is false advertisement and very deceptive to buyers. I can't imagine people that ordered this truck online, just for it to show up and realize they have a purple truck half the day.  I'm not saying anything is wrong with a purple and blue truck. If that's your thing, go for it. But for someone that thinks they are buying a laser blue truck due to Chevrolets false advertising and deceptive ploys, they will be in for a terrible surprise.  Listen, this is a great pick up truck. It looks great as far as the lines, and it performs outstanding. The price point is excellent. But that blue to purple transition is a huge surprise to a lot of buyers.   I will be trading mine in next month and I haven't even made the first payment. It was a $3000 mistake that will cost me in depreciation value.  The only other complaint that I have about the truck is that if you get one, get one with the sidestep. The truck looks good being raised up, but that step out it's about 6 inches short for me and I always have to slide off the seat before I hit the ground. I am about 5 foot 10.","324":"I'm probably one of a few to get the LT with the 2.5L gas engine.  I was just not impressed by the 3.6l enough to pay the premium.  The LT package adds the larger screen for the center console.  It's worth every penny of price difference.  Apple car play gives you navigation for free, calling, streaming, talk to text, all work great. I've put 16,000 miles on in about 7 months.  The truck rides wonderfully, it's easy to park, and has enough room for the home improvement work.  Of those 16,000, 2000 miles were spent towing a car across country.  The little 4 did great, lost some speed on the longer grades but on flat ground no complaints.  Around town I average 22 mpg, 16-18 towing and about 25-29 on the highway unloaded.  For doing work around the house and on cars it has a ton of well thought out features.  The corner steps on the bumper make getting in and out easy.  The storage under the back seat is big enough for tie down straps, hitch, and gloves.  The GM roll up hard bed cover is a must have addition.  It keeps whatever is in the bed dry, but can be rolled up to haul tall things.  The short bed is small but still big enough to load a pallet full of floor and shut the tailgate.","325":"Mpg not as good as I thought, but overall very nice truck.  For the money I could've bought a silverado but tired of driving a big truck for what I use it for.  Kids have plenty of room and they feel comfortable in the rear seats. Overall, very good truck. Not as small as people think but it's not a gas guzzler like my old tundra","326":"Good looking, good handling mid-size sport truck. However, towing is horrible. Towing capacity 7700#...struggles to tow 3000#. If you need to tow look at something else!","327":"We looked at 5 lots before buying. We went back to the same guy that we had bought our prior 2 cars from trusted him and got the best deal. Local for repairs or accidents to get truck fixed if need be.","328":"I have a 2016 LT crew cab colorado (8900 miles) with leather heated seats and lots of accessories (linex bedliner, chevy folding tonneau cover, chrome package, sliding rear window w\/ defrost, engine braking system, wheel well liners, projector headlights, mylink navigation, lane warning, forward distance warning , & chrome step bars with rainforest green metallic paint.   I downsized from a full size crew cab 4x4 silverado (2011).   I really like the truck. On the downside -  no cd player, center counsel a one hole accessory with no dividers, door storage areas narrow but okay.  The \"touch screen\" okay but I am \"old school\" and learning curve is somewhat uphill but not difficult.  Get the Chevy Mylink navigation system vs On star.  Once the Onstar test period expires, the Chevy Mylink nav system is fully operational and accurate.  I do not have requirement for Sirus radio or On Star. Highway and interstate speeds no problem.  Cruise control excellent.  Gas mileage very good (v6). you will not be disappointed with the 2016 Colorado.","329":"Before buying my 2016 Colorado in October of 2015, I was a committed Tacoma owner.  I drove a 4wd Tacoma crew cab for 12 years and really loved it.  But when I went to look at the 2016 Tacoma, the dealers only had 2015 models in stock and they did not come close in comparison to the Colorado.  My mileage is a lot better than my Tacoma was (averaged 18-19 mpg); over the last 11 months I have consistently gotten 22-24 mpg.  I admit I have a light foot, although I routinely travel 70 mph on the highway.  The key is to avoid sudden accelerations.  I have also been happy with  the deeper bed (check it out - the Colorado bed is several inches deeper than Tacoma), the dampened tailgate and the step bumper, which makes it much easier to get up into the bed.  I also bought the custom ladder rack that Chevy offers and have been very happy with it.  It's super-sturdy and carries something like 800 pounds.  The 4wd system has also worked great on trips to NH, VT and other snowy places.  The only thing I don't like about my Colorado is the plastic shield that's bolted to the bottom of the front bumper.  Obviously, it's designed to improve gas mileage, but it scrapes when I go off-road and even once when I pulled up to a concrete parking curb.  On the plus side, if I want to take it off, it would be easy to do (just a bunch of screws) but I have been too lazy to remove it.  I've had no mechanical issues and the display\/electronics inside are really first-class.  I admit to having had some jitters when I first bought it, since I have really been a Tacoma fan, but I took the leap but it has paid off so far.","330":"I was sold on this truck for a few primary reasons - mpg and durability of the duramax.  I've run my gas powered vehicles to 300k miles and beyond consistently and i see no reason why this engine can't far exceed this number.  I've had the truck for only a few days now and have been impressed so far.  I'm especially pleased that being 6'6\"\/230, i still fit comfortably in the driver's seat (though the headrest\/top of seat hits my neck area and will take some getting used to).  My crew cab F150 and prior silverado did not provide this luxury.  The inferno orange color certainly grabs attention.  Can't wait to get a month under my belt to see what the true mpg will be but after 2 days the OBC shows 24 mostly city driving - impressive.  The torque this thing generates makes you feel as though you could unroot a 100 year old redwood with little problem.  Was a little worried about this engine being that it's so new but after researching it appears that it's been in use over seas for a few years so hopefully all the kinks have been worked out by now.","331":"I love the truck!  Not only is it great looking, but with the 6 cylinder engine and 4 wheel drive it can handle anything I may need it to do.  The electronics are impressive and it will be difficult to decide which of the subscriptions (satellite radio, WiFi, etc.) I should keep after the trials end.  I do have an unresolved problem with inconsistent air conditioning performance, but I am confident my dealer will correct.","332":"I will start with the pros on my Colorado Z71.                           First thing is first, the truck is beautiful. Its a head turning vehicle and easily catches the attention of others , it did for me. from the front to the rear, the truck looks luxurious but rugged. Chevrolet found the sweet spot with this design. The bed is coated with a hard lining and also has plenty of room for cargo. the truck comes with a 2\" hitch connection, and a 3 piece rear window. When sitting in the Driver seat I have great visibility around the entire vehicle, its very east to maneuver, but for those who have a hard time backing into parking spaces it comes with a reverse camera and reverse guide shown on the main screen on the front panel. the interior of the truck is great , and very comfortable. I am 6'2\" and fit fine in this light duty truck. The seats are lined with leather and with the dark window tint , stay very cool. The steering wheel has a great feel and from the driver seat I have a solid view of all the instruments and screens in the truck. there is plenty of room inside the truck for passengers and small cargo if needed. The power of the truck is great , I wont say incredible but for a light duty, its great. This is where the Cons come in.                         Ill begin with the acceleration of the truck , its not bad, however I feel the transmission is very sluggish and has trouble deciding which gears to use when starting its acceleration and when beginning to decelerate from speed. The Gas mileage and range is also exaggerated, what was suppose to be 22 city 31 hwy, is really 14 city 25 hwy. If I would have knows this prior to purchase I would have went with a Silverado. I just hit 450 miles and the Bose sound system is rattling in the passenger door. When I drove it off the lot I didn't have this problem. I believe its the door panel making the noise, rather than the sound system. My last con on the 2016 Colorado Z71 would be the front wind guard, it sits very low to the ground with a few inches of clearance, Understanding this is a luxury truck, its still a Z71 OffRoad, and with no clearance in the front, It limits where you can go and what you can do without taking it off and getting the front of the tuck lifted.     Overall I want to give the truck 5 stars, though i just hit 450 miles and still have to brake it in. So far it has treated me very well and I'm looking forward to keeping this truck and making the most of it.","333":"Bought this truck on a Wednesday took it back to the dealer with electrical issues Saturday. Dealer has had ever since. More than 2 weeks as of this post. Dealer support is average GM support is piss poor. I really like the truck but this is not acceptable. GM needs to do better at standing behind its products. After all it was we the people that kept them in business they should take better care of their customers\/owners.","334":"I have the duramax, but there was no input for the dmax. love the truck, love the power and fuel mileage. only thing I don't like about the truck is that it wants to hold lower gears running up into higher rpm's which is the exact opposite of what every other gm vehicle likes to do. I think if it shifted sooner I wouldn't have a single complaint.","335":"Have driven 3K in my new Colorado Z71, it\u2019s been great. Mileage is 21 combined, considering I drive in mountains not bad, made trip to Vegas avg. 23 (V6 engine) Very quiet on the inside, has the Boise system sounds great. Ride is very good for a truck; seats are pretty good. Have the side rails have to get use too, I guess you really don\u2019t need them.  Overall at this point I would give it 4.5 out of 5.","336":"My truck is roomy, comfortable and quite. The 4 banger won't break speed records but keeps up with traffic nicely. Would recommend  the six for pulling around boats or other heavy equipment. Getting an average of 19.6 city mpg which is where I do most of my driving and looking real good doing it.","337":"I purchased this truck back in May. I was in the market for a new truck and wanted to downsize from my F150 I owned for about 8 years. I like the laser blue, which depends on the sunlight, gives off a purplish hue. Looks pretty darn good with the WT package. The fuel economy is pretty decent for a 4 cylinder; much better than 17 mpg I got in the F150. You do have to step on the accelerator to get it to move when entering the freeway. I hear the same thing about its 6 cyl. brothers, so it doesn't really bother me. It's surprisingly comfortable on road trips, and my 13 yr old son loves it....as long he's not in the back seat. The extended cab isn't great for carrying passengers in the back, but I didn't buy the truck for that purpose. This is my go to work, weekend trip kind of truck.","338":"After 10,000 miles of ownership with this new Duramax Colorado, and the \"honeymoon\" period now well in the review mirror, I can say that most of the professional review articles you will read from Chevy's pre-launch media event and test drive weekend in Solvang California are accurate.  First, if this is your first ever diesel vehicle you have owned or driven, it may seem a bit noisy at idle and low speeds.  If you have previously owned diesel vehicles, it will seem very quiet at idle and low speed driving.  At highway speeds, you will hardly notice a difference  in quietness and refinement between the diesel and gas options.   The diesel fits this truck much better than the gas options in my view, (and I drove all engines extensively before buying).... smooth and punchy without any wailing, hi rev drama.  Truly satisfying. Great passing.   If you are looking for a \"racetruck\", buy the V6 or something else.  The Duramax is just adequately smooth.  As for MPG, the vehicle's trip computer is overly optimistic, although its true MPG is within close specs of the EPA's rating.  For example, I have had mellow 60MPH highway runs where, after 300-400 miles, the trip meter reports around 32 MPG, yet a real check with a calculator at the fuel pump revealed around 30 MPG.  Still not bad, just do not buy into many of the anecdotes you will read from owners\/reviewers reporting outrageous fuel mileage above and beyond the EPA's rating.  (Remember, people love to boast and justify their hard earned money spent).  Overall, a very satisfied experience with this truck.  Again, it is not perfect, but then also, we consumers have become very spoiled in our expectations of what cars should be these days.   The Z71 heated seats with lumbar adjustment are great for my bad, post surgery back.  The control layout is very functional, and the overall feel (door slams, no squeaks, rattles etc.) is superb.  The bluetooth system is not perfect, but what bluetooth system is?  Very seldom are there hangups or glitches.  It works flawlessly most of the time.  Apple Carplay is great, but I only use it on long trips or for navigation, as it requires you to plug in, whereas I mostly keep my phone in my pocket... music, phone, siri, etc. works great with the steering wheel controls.   Conversely, as a long term fan of the Toyota product, I had eagerly been waiting for the new 2016 Tacoma to arrive throughout 2015.  When it did, I test drove many of them, even rented one and drove it 100 miles, trying to love it, and I just couldn't for some reason.   GM lured me over, as they proved, in my view, that they were the hungry underdog seeking to knock off the Tacoma.  I believe they did just that.  I just hope this truck proves as reliable as the Tacoma over the years to come.  However, a current Consumer Reports rating on the new Tacoma actually has it in last place for reliability for now, so we shall see.","339":"I took a chance and went with the 2.8 duramax. Pros; Power,mileage, towing its got it all in one package! The best feature is the engine brake, when towing 5000lb in the hills you will rarely touch the brakes. I have 5000 miles on the truck and have averaged 25 mpg most of that towing at highway speed.I've got 30 on the highway! It has better than V6 gas Power!! Cons; The front air dam is stupid!(I took it off the second day i owned the truck and they used 16 screws to hold it on that are impossible to get at  Laser Blue can look Purple not happy with color","340":"It's the best pick up I've owned only issue is the step makes exits a little awkward til I get it down.","341":"Idles rough occasionally, sometimes feels like a V6 sometimes like a 4 cylinder. Engine hesitates then eventually accelerates, transmission does not always down shift so feels sluggish at times. Have taken it to the dealer and they cannot find anything wrong, they say that is normal for this vehicle!!?  I really like this truck except for the inconsistent performance.  I would not have purchased this truck if I had known it runs this way.  Any ECU mods for this truck?","342":"I have almost 1500 miles on my 2016 Colorado Ext Cab V6 and I love it! I've driven around town averaging 19-20mpg and highway speeds at 55-60 mpg it averaged 24.5-26 mpg and highway speeds at 70-80 it averaged 23-24mpg. The trans has been very smooth and I have not had issues finding any gears or stepping on the throttle to get around a horse and buggy without it slamming into a low gear. The transitions have always been flawless. It loves cruising in the 50-60 mph range but on the highway keeping it around 70 you have to keep you foot on the gas just a little, personally it does not bother me. From the line it feels quite torquey and has plenty of get up and go. From inside the cabin the ride is phenomenal. It's very quite, I've been in quite a few new vehicles and none have been quieter. The handling is as smooth as can be. The steering wheel never gets heavy no matter the sharpest turns. Even having the off road suspension the ride isn't stiff at all. It handles bumps and does not rattle or bounce around. Driving it you would not think it has stiffer suspension. The interior itself I think looks nice and it's a truck so i'm not looking for outright luxury. The extended cab truly does not have room for passengers comfortably, although I bought mine more for storage than to haul people, so that does not bother me. Also size wise, this truck can be parked anywhere! The turning radius is amazing, just when you expect it to run out of turn angle, you can crank the wheel even more and put it into any parking spot. The cabin room I think is plenty, not as much as my dads Sierra 2500 but i'm 5'11'' and my dad is 6'2'' and there is plenty of room for both of us in the front seats. Leg room and head room are more than enough. Overall i'm very satisfied with my purchase and don't regret it one bit.","343":"When I bought my truck it had side runners on it. The dealer asked if I wanted them on I thought I would try them. As soon as i got home anf got out for the first time they were very uncomfortable. Called dealer he was trying to tradee something for them then said no. Now I have $700 to runners in my garage","344":"Purchased a new 2016 Colorado to replace my commuter vehicle 2007 impala with 185,000 miles , truck has 2000 miles and left me stranded.  blowing fuse on injector bank on left side of 3.6 gas engine, dealer working on resolution .  the trucks front power driver seat is uncomfortable on 2 hour drive as seat bottom doesn't tilt , I know its a truck but my 2002 Silverado crew cab seat beats it hands down.  The 4x4 shift button can be bumped into 4x4 with your knee and no light on dash to indicate its engaged.   Transmission shifts hard up and down in upper gears.  Its a great looking truck but very concerned about reliability on  having electrical issues this early on , I may trade for a Silverado\nPros truck gets good mpg , easy to park and drive in the city.","345":"If you are looking truck for fuel economy don't buy this truck on city don't give me more then 17mpg and fwy 23, the dealer ship said after 5000 milles will be bether but is. Not truth . Now after 12 000 miles spell more gas then before, on street 16 or 15 miles per gallon end fwy only 22 with no trafic.","346":"Get the diesel if you want hauling and  towing capabilities and great fuel economy. The diesel was not available when i got my Colorado Lt V6 I wish i waited for a while because they have great deals on the diesel engine version and less on what I paid for my regular V6 truck. Overall you can't go wrong with the Colorado truck in any configuration it does what it does well and in comfort with great refinement in a mid size truck.","347":"Can you believe that there is no visible indicator in the instrument cluster showing the current state of the 4 wheel drive system. You have to look at the selector switch located low on the dash and blocked from view by the steering wheel. I've owned 3 other vehicles with 4 wheel drive and this is by far the worst. Shift in or out can be harsh at times. Low mounted switch is often hit by my knee when exiting causing selector to be switched to 4wd. \nSeats have hard edge that is too high and is always felt on entry and exit.  Vehicle leans to drivers side be 0.75 inches at rear wheel opening. Dealer says that's within tolerance.\nUpdate at 19000 miles:\nStill leans, gas mileage about same, comfortable on long trip.   Had to install front mud guards since body design allows mud from front wheels to be sprayed on and around door handles. Also replaced headlights with LED bulbs for better night driving.","348":"I've always owned a full size truck. But now that I'm retired, I felt I no longer needed the additional size or expense. My wife & I were looking at a Toyota Tacoma, but it didn't offer power seats. When we saw the Colorado in Rain Forest Green in the Z71 Off Road package with so much luxury, we knew it was the truck for us. The ride is smooth, engine is powerful, seats are heated with leather trim. We love everything about it. We also added several Chevy accessories at the dealer without searching other stores or web sites.","349":"Overall, the truck is great.  Chevy nailed the looks.  It's tough, rugged and modern and does a great job of making it stand out on the road.\n\nThe interior is excellent, but large drivers might have some time adjusting the seat to get it comfortable.  Some issues with the motor... In normal drive mode, you have to mash the pedal to the floor to extract power out of it.  The power is there, but the pedal calibration is there to soften power delivery and help improve fuel economy.  Pushing the \"tow mode\" button helps, it changes the throttle response and shifting patterns on the transmission.  It's essentially a renamed \"sport\" mode that you would find on a car.  I drive in tow mode exclusively.\n\nHave your dealer install the 2\" front leveling kit so that it doesn't look it is standing on it's nose, and makes the truck look balanced.  You can throw a set of aggressive off-road 265\/70-R17 tires on the stock rims without clearance issues once you do the leveling kit.  Lifts it a little more, and makes it look balanced.\n\nThe air damn under the front bumper needs to come off if you want to take this off road.  Look at every picture of the truck in stock form.  You have this 305hp off road package truck, and yet that plastic trim will hit a curb in a parking lot.  Removing that and installing the leveling kit($400), gives the front end a lot of clearance for moderate off road capabilities...\n\nThis truck, once set up, has great off-road potential.  It will also haul more than any other truck in it's class.\n\nOverall I am VERY happy with my purchase.  Got the Crew Cab, Z71 4x4 with Bose 7 speaker audio, NAV, spray in bed liner, heavy duty tow package, tinted windows, side steps, etc... for $37k  \n\nYou get a lot of truck for the money, Chevrolet did a great job on this model and that's why it is Motor Trend Truck of the Year, 2 years running.\n\nIt's not perfect, but I rate the overall execution of an 8.5 out of 10.","350":"I have had the truck about 6 weeks. Nice looking truck inside and out. Shortly after buying I noticed the front seat back moves so I took it back to the dealer. They said nothing was broken. They compared it to other trucks and said it was normal for this truck. Not liking the answer I took it another dealer and they said the same thing. I have a hard time with this. I have a call into GM and they don't seem to care. There was a recall on the 2015 for a loose seat but nothing happening on this one. I have never experienced this in any other vehicle.","351":"Let me start out by saying I absolutely love the 2016 Colorado!  We traded in our 2009 Traverse for our 2016 Colorado in an effort to both downsize (we are empty nesters) and prepare for some more than casual towing (we have a boat and are planning on getting a camper).  The Traverse had limited towing capacity, which was really impacting what we could buy in the way of a travel trailer.  It also had limitations for cargo hauling, especially if the cargo was oversized and could not fit in the cargo bay.\n\nWe looked at a GMC Canyon and was wowed by the options (especially the leather), but we also wanted a truck that we could do some work in if required, so the Colorado Z71 trim better fit the bill.  It is a much quieter drive than the Traverse, with a comprehensive and fairly intuitive infotainment system.  I do miss the CD player option, but with most folks going for digital downloads instead of discs, I do understand the move away from CD players.\n\nIn the approximately 1990 miles we've driven it (300 of which was from the dealer driving it in from out of state), we've thus far taken in on a trip to Chicago and the performance was excellent.  Obviously not the mileage of a Cruze or other economy type car, but comfortable in the mid 20s for mpg.  The view seems to go on forever (my daily driver is a 2010 Camaro, with some serious view issues out back), and the rear backup camera is a huge plus.  We opted for some after market accessories (floormats, soft cover, spray in bed liner, mud flaps, bed mat and running boards) which really decked it out.  I recommend the running boards; short folks like my wife and I greatly benefit from the extra step in and out of the vehicle.\n\nThe Colorado fits nicely in the garage with a little room to spare.  I'm looking forward to years of service, hauling and towing in comfort and style with our new truck.  I recommend the Colorado for anyone who is looking for a size down from the Silverado sized trucks.\n\nUpdate October 2016:\nIf it's possible, we have fallen more in love with our 2016 Colorado than when we first drove it home.  We have two other cars that we use for daily driving, so even this far into our ownership we haven't rolled 10K on the truck, but we have definitely gotten our money's worth thus far.  It tows our boat with ease and makes running errands such as dump runs easy.  It has become our vehicle of choice for road trips (shocking, since I drive a Camaro) and the functionality of the driver infotainment system really makes driving a joy.  If you haven't driven one, I highly recommend taking one out for a spin.\n\nUpdate April 2017:\nThe love affair with the Colorado continues unabated.  In addition to towing the boat, it now is our primary tow vehicle for towing our new camper.  The tow package helps keep the transmission from overheating (and killing the overdrive), but it sure sucked up the miles per gallon.  On the return trip from getting out camper in Illinois, we went from averaging about 22 MPG to 8.  I think a lot of that was also me learning to tow the camper and how to massage the gear shifting while towing.  We rolled 15K miles this month, and are looking forward to many more years of service with the Colorado.","352":"The hype does not justify the cost. It isn't worth waiting on a list to pay over MSRP. The front seat bottom cushion is so short it hits you mid-leg and I am only 5'9\". Instrumentation... You can barely see the driver's cluster in bright sunlight even at full brightness adjustment. And the fuel gauge\/radiator cluster is nearly impossible to see ever, even at night still vaguely visible. So if you run out of gas, you won't know until the engine stops. The windshield wiper feature for a spray and wipe only wipes one time after it sprays (pull back on lever to activate, one quick spray and one swipe...leaving washer fluid running down windshield and you have to push lever down again to get it to finish the job...how distracting is that when driving and trying to remove road grime? The sun visors are too short, and don't help at all when the sun is coming at you from the top left angle of windshield unless you invert the visor and then you hit your face on it.  The glove box doesn't lock...enough said, this was a standard of any vehicle...ever! Gas Mileage, average 15-18 combined, nothing like Chevy states it will do. Cannot get ANY support from Chevrolet Customer Assistance\/MyLink about Infotainment system, just get answers like \" I'm not sure, hey wait, the guy I need to ask is just walking by, let me call you back...\" And never called me back, more than once same response. Dealership same way, no return call so I guess once the deal is done, they wash their hands of you. The only good things are the Bose sound quality, not great but better than stock radio. And the safety features like lane departure warning and front collision warning system. Back-up camera  image quality is washed-out almost impossible to see anything behind you even in shade with no sunlight hitting it directly, just bad equipment. And I bought American because of the lousy service from foreign import dealerships. I hope you read all of this review, since it may really help you not make the wrong choice. This truck looks great inside and out, but there are major flaws. Hope Chevy puts a \"flash update\" out for the poor rear view camera quality and hires some people that can actually give tech support for things nobody understands, including dealership, AND Chevrolet Customer Service support. On the hole it isn't what it seems. Chevy knows it, that's why they hype up this truck and keep pricing so high. Oh and look under driver's seat and see the rust already starting on the metal parts there. Was this because of the bad water issue in Detroit, that caused a ton of rust issues, yet did Chevy put those parts in anyway?? Lastly, the a\/c has a mind of it's own, even when Auto Climate feature is not engaged, the a\/c still runs in auto, meaning, the cold air stops being cold and you have to constantly adjust the digital readout dial to lower temp to get cool again, and air vents have very limited air flow adjustment, either you the driver freeze and nobody in back seat gets air, or you the driver bake to give backseat cool air. Oh, and also the accelerator pedal is so close to the transmission hump it can get dangerous if you wear boots, or work boots or just athletic shoes, boy was that a mistake! Plastic interior seems cheap and once the glitter faded from buying a new truck, it left me very dissatisfied.","353":"I have had this truck for 1 month so far everything works great I am getting 21-22 miles per gallon on short trips and the comfort is good , I was a Ram owner for the last 8 years did not need the Big Truck anymore after getting only 14.5 to 17 miles per gallon [Hemi] 4x4. Had a new Ford F150 JUNK for 6 months back in 05 and traded on the old 05 Colorado with 5 cyl. and it could out tow a Small v8 2005 F150 All my trucks have been 4x4's  My new Colorado has no problem Towing my 8 ft. trailer with my Polaris side by side.","354":"This truck is very roomy and comfortable,even with 2 Adults and three adolescents.The gas millage is good even on short trips as well as long ones.Driving it is always enjoyable and body style draws a lot of attention from other folk.The vehicle is used family trips as well as off road travels and suits me fine.","355":"I haven't owned a Chevy product in over a decade. This Colorado was eye catching at first, then I drove it and fell in love with all the amenities it had to offer. This truck has all the bells and whistles I had become accustomed to in my luxury cars and sports cars. It has not let me down in any of the areas that are important to me.  Good fuel economy and plenty of get up and go. Leather and heated seats, Navigation, and Apple car play were all major necessities, and the Colorado delivered them. I recommend  this truck to  anyone looking for a mid size truc.","356":null,"357":"Love this truck! Trust me, if you like the  V6 Colorado, you'll love the Duramax. Each time I drive it, I smile and know I made the right decision. Pulls trailers without issue. Internal break controller works great. Fuel economy can vary. Pulling weighted trailer at 75 MPH: low 20's. Normal driving at 60 MPH on flatter roads: 30+ MPH. My brother has one with nearly 14k miles. Does more highway driving, so his average is about 3-4 MPG more than mine.","358":"I have the Z71 extended cab with the V6, with 6000 miles, looks great runs like crap. The truck is very under powered, I'm not sure where the towing 10K comes from I pulled small trailer with lawn equipment and the truck struggled with that small load, stayed in manual mode mostly. The running boards are for looks only, make getting out of vehicle hard, may sprain my knee someday. The XM radio goes out in the wide open space, no help from dealer on that one. The back up camera is continually lock screening, must turn truck off to reset. There is a lot of engine noise inside the cab.  Also has recall on hood, that I am getting run around from dealership on, take truck there they say have part then told its on order, this has happen multiple times, Like some others have said I too sometimes think the hood is going to fly off. So you can understand my concern. Maybe Rick Hedrick should get off the track and back into his dealerships again, I wont be returning, and this after buying 5 vehicles from his stores. The fuel mileage is not that great best I have seen is 19, that was freeway driving. Do not buy this truck.","359":null,"360":"Have 3K on the truck so far and absolutely love it and have had zero problems. I am 6'2 and have no problem fitting in the truck unlike in the Tacoma and Frontier that I tested. I took off the silly air dam that took away ground clearance and put on a leveling kit. So far I've loved every aspect of the truck, especially the overall size which has been perfect for around town. The 4x4 system works great and gets you through any kind of terrain. Technology wise the truck hits the spot especially with Apple CarPlay and 4G LTE. You don't need to bother getting navigation or anything else if you have an iPhone (Android Auto coming soon as well). The only gripe I have is that the Colorado does not get the same soft touch w\/ stitching interior as the GMC Canyon. All in all it's a fantastic looking and performing midsize truck.","361":"I purchase a 2016 Z71 4WD black Trail Boss about three weeks ago and am loving it so far. I really like the trail boss package accessories like the off road sport bar and LED off road lights on top. The black painted wheels and aggressive all terrain tires seem to turn heads. I got all the options. Heated seats, navigation, Bose 7 speaker system, spray in bed liner, etc. \n\nI'm loving it so far. The technology in this truck is amazing. I especially love the apple car play feature that allows me to reflect my iOS device onto the in-dash display. The rear view camera is great with its line projections that show you where you're going to end up as you turn the wheel. I didn't especially like the price though. For everything, including the trail boss package (extra $7k), I ended up paying a little over 42k for the truck including an extended 72k mile bumper to bumper warranty.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the truck is its lack of responsiveness when laying on the gas. It takes a little long to switch gears, so I end up using the manual gear switching so that I can control when the truck shifts up and down. I'm glad it has this option. Over the course of 1,000 miles, I've ended up with an average of 17MPG. I'm a pretty aggressive driver though, so others may get better gas consumption rates.\n\nOverall, I'm loving the truck. I traded in my 2012 TRD Tacoma and don't regret it a bit. This is the best vehicle I've owned thus far. I can't give an accurate report to reliability yet or cost of ownership as I've only had it for a little less than a month.\n\nDon't get the 4 cylinder unless you drive like a granny. The v6 or turbo diesel are the only ways to go.","362":"purchased fully loaded 2016 Z71 with trailer tow. 3000# trailer, truck could not hold a strait line above 65 mph. same trailer same driver\njeep grand cherokee 80 mph no issues. obviously not the trailer.  GM shruggs it off. great truck if your not pulling. buyer beware","363":"Bought the crew cab WT with the 2.5L engine, auto transmission, & only 2 option packages 2 1\/2 weeks ago. Manual tranny not available. Like it better than my previous '03 X cab Silverado which had no engine holdback going downhill; this engine and tranny does. Has enough power for me, a senior, and my daughters appreciate that I am not zoom - zooming around with my trade-in; a stick shift Pontiac Vibe. Only major problem is figuring out the infotainment system which is not user friendly to normally perceptive folks. The truck fits in my garage; a 2015 Silverado X cab wouldn't.\n\nOnce I install an after market soft roll up tonneau cover, bed mat, retractable tie downs, and 4 wire electric trailer connector for about $450 + tax, I will have a vehicle that will do everything I want.","364":"Overall pretty happy with my 2016 Colorado. Only major issues are the poor front ground clearance and my hood really viberates when you drive in the wind. In a strong wind feels like the hood is going to blow off.","365":"I paid good money for the Chevy Colorado 4 dr Z71 off-road package.  Within 2 weeks of owning the vehicle, the transmission went out @ just a little over 400 miles on the vehicle.  The truck is very nice and I loved everything about it, but I am very disappointed that the truck almost left me stranded on the highway and was brand new.","366":"Laser blue LT 4x4 Crew Cab.  Good value with the options.   Sluggish at times on take off and  rough shifting staying up hill. Not quite enough room for an infant seat,  toddler seat, and a 7 year old but good room for a \"midsized\" truck.  A real pleasure to drive!  Overall a very well built truck and something Chevrolet has hit a solid triple on! A solid truck that you will be happy with.  The \"2 year\/ 24000 mile service agreement is a sham.  That was very disappointing.  It only covers 2 oil changes.  Big negative for Chevy","367":"Just purchased ( 2015 Black Friday) 2016 Colorado LT 4x4, with all the options, Rainforest green, with dark ash leather\nGot 10% off MSRP of $40K, and 1.99% 6 year loan\nGreat looks, sharp interior, great size, fits in my garage and is easy to park, and has good turning radius. \nThis truck has all the upgrades ( Conv and luxury package, plus safety package )\nRide is very nice, some sharp jolts on bad pavement.\nThe one negative, the front seats are narrow, average comfort, but I love the heated feature, and that I can raise the seat\nTest drove the 2016 Toyota Tacoma, eliminated it, as there is no power seat option, and no way to raise or lower the seat. Too low of a seating position\n\nI spent over a year looking at mid-size trucks, and the Colorado is #1 in my opinion\n\nUPDATE:  6-14-16- now have 12,000 miles on Colorado, no major problems, still love the truck.  One minor annoyance, and I hope Chevy fixes this in future updates, is the transmission.  It is geared to search for lowest gear ( to get better gas mileage), but it makes it tough when you need quick acceleration, it hesitates too much.  One thing I now do, is use the manual mode if I want the RPM\"s up, as you can control what gear you are in.   As far as looks, I get an average of 3-4 people checking out the truck, people will stop me, and ask about it.  Definitely the best looking and unique truck in the market right now.\n\nUPDATE:  6-15-17- Now have 29,000 miles on my Colorado, no major or minor problems, still love the truck.  Chevy has updated the 2017 Colorado with a new 8 speed transmission.  This will eliminate the hesitation, I see on my 6 speed 2016.    I have added 2 new custom upgrades, I would recommend.  Cat back Muffler system ( $1,000) and a cold air intake air filter system ( $500 )  Both were dealer installed, so it keeps your warranty in place.  Gives better throaty sound, and I am getting half mpg better mileage. I was averaging 20.5, now I get 21, with mixed use driving.  Love it!","368":"Disappointed that it was not as nice as silverado. Wanted leather seats. 99% had cloth seats.","369":"Was going to buy a new V6 Colorado until test drive this past weekend (Nov 27, 2015). Rides nice but transmission hesitates \/ stumbles badly when applying the gas. Going up interstate ramp or even around town. Real bad hesitation and totally unacceptable to the point you feel the vehicle will stall and hope somebody else doesn't rear end you. I asked the dealers agent riding with me about the hesitation and he didn't say one word. I won't be buying one of these.","370":"It's a little bit of a step to get in and out of. There was no CD player or even an option for one.","371":"Have a 1100 miles so far and have been very happy. Love the way it drives and have been getting excellent gas mileage with the V6. Getting 26 mpg @ 70 mph. Very peppy with the V6, I believe it out performs my 2013 Silverado. The Infotainment system is very nice with great sound. So far the only thing that I am upset about is the lack of a CD player and auto 4 wheel drive option. I live in Michigan and enjoyed the option of auto 4wd when the roads were slick but not heavly snow covered.\nHas plenty of tow ability and love the 6 yo 7 mpg more I an getting over the 2013 Silverado.","372":"We bought this truck new.  It looks nice with clean lines.  Wife likes it because it sets her up higher to see down the road (we had a car). Handles really well.  We got it to be able to park in the current size parking spaces.  We have a 2500 HD long bed in which we pull our travel trailer with but it became real to find and get in to and out of the businesses parking spaces.  Works well for that reason.  We have pulled our 20 foot ski and fish boat and it pulled it well.  Unloaded and loaded on some steep boat ramps with no problem.  The main reason I did not give it a 5-star rating was after we purchased it,  we found out it did not have a CD player.  We got the best entrainment package available and never gave it thought of not having a CD player.  Wife likes to listen to her religious and Christmas CD's.  Now we have to down load the CD's on to a flash drive and plug into one of the USB ports.  Like other have said,  I will let you know for sure how well we like this truck in ten years.   Otherwise, at the this moment, we both like it.  Also, Bose sound system really sound good in the truck.","373":"Great midsize truck, looking forward to owning for a long time","374":"I love the pickup.  But it's brand new so I can't really comment on reliability or anything significant.  Storage is an issue.  I wish there were more or deeper compartments in the back like what you see in some Silverado models.  A bed compartment like what is on the Ridgeline would be great as well.  But that's an issue with most pickups and it's closer competitor, the Tacoma, doesn't have those either.  I didn't think the Apple Car Play would be all that important to me.  But now that I have it, I use it a lot and wouldn't dream of not having it -- especially in CA where handling your phone while driving is now a legal issue.  Acceleration doesn't seem that impressive by the feel of it.  But it's really just so smooth that I hardly notice the acceleration.  I find myself going 70 when I think I'm only going 55 as I'm trying to merge onto the freeway.  So it's probably good even if not really impressive.  Haven't towed with it yet.All in all, I love it.  If I still love it in 10 years, then I'll feel more comfortable giving it 5 stars.","375":"I traded in my 2015 Nissan Pro4x extended cab for a 2017 Colorado z71 extended cab. I made this purchase strictly based on ratings- The dealer did not have any in stock. The front seats of the Frontier were more comfortable, and better looking. The back seat area in the Frontier was useable, but not comfortable.The Colorado is not even useable. The headlight switch and the 4 wheel drive switch on the Colorado are poorly positioned, and I have found that my legs move these switches when getting in or out of the vehicle.(No telling how long I drove around in 4-wheel drive when I didn't need it.) Also, I can't see these switches when driving. The throttle response combined with the shifting of the 8 speed transmission provide a feeling of hesitation. The back doors must be slammed hard to get the door ajar light off. The ride on the highway is car-like and smooth. I paid extra to get the Cajun Red Tintcoat exterior color, and really like the way it looks. I have only put about 750 miles on this truck, and would trade it for a new Pro4x if I could afford it.","376":"Wanted a truck with no real frills, but was surprised by the work truck features.  Very happy over-all.  Hey survey writers - kind of hard to judge reliability, maintenance costs, and resale values of a new vehicle - ask me again in ten years.","377":"Would not buy as a work truck, to much Tech, on steering wheel, too many Bells- Whistles, has it geeked up and jucked up as a work truck, Also the 2.5 4 cyl. is a lie for advertised gas milage, I tried everything in the world on test ride home and could not squeeze over 22 mpg out of it, I think the only way you could get more is coasting down a mountain, or being towed behind a bigger truck!","378":"Considering the price, comfort, and gas mileage you cannot go wrong with this truck.  I bought my truck brand new and it has been excellent.  I was skeptical to get the four cylinder engine, but I am glad I did.  The engine is a direct injection that runs very smooth and saves gas.  I have taken the truck on several road trips with excellent gas mileage.  The biggest plus is the comfort.  For a taller driver (6'2) the leg room is ample and allows you to stretch out.  The rear seats are ok for space and comfort.  The onboard computer systems are very user friendly and easy to navigate.  If you are looking for a daily driver pick up, long trip pick up or even a weekend truck, then this is it!","379":"So disappointed in our purchase of a Colorado. It came with a feature we were not made aware of. In cold weather the truck squeaks like an old squeaky bed. It sounds like a piece of junk going down the road. It is great advertisement for GM. Spend your hard earned dollars on another brand. The company has no answers.","380":"Don't get stuck in traffic ! the trans doesn't  know what it wants to do, it will shudder between gears sometimes so bad you have to hit the brakes to make it stop. Also the monitors in the center panel can sometimes change because there are switches on the back side of the steering wheel that can be touched while turning, changing your radio station, volume, and center information. Also being in the Chicago\/northern Indiana\/Michigan area when the temperature is below 40 after you have shoveled the drive, removed the snow from the truck, and crawl into the truck a message appears on the center screen warning you it`s cold and be careful! Also when your driving the center panel will show a message Don`t read this screen and drive distracted and you must touch the screen to make the message go away. Also under the hood is a 2ft. round piece of black plastic that serves no purpose other than keep heat in the already cramped engine bay and there are 2 useless pieces of plastic covering the right headlight , why not use this material to good use Like an ASSIST HANDLE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE!!! The truck gets great gas mileage but the Buick 217 cubic inch V6 is a car engine, not a truck engine. It does not pull well at low speeds and added to the \"shudder shift six\" transmission you have to play the throttle, no acceleration or sudden acceleration. The stub doors, when it is cold out, will not shut properly and you will not get a door open light until you are driving. Then the bells go off at 60mph and get worse and worse until you are able to Safely pull off the road to shut the door. If you check the lower latch will have about 1\/8 of an inch play in it when it does this. The dealer says \"They All Do This,\"  and there is nothing they can do! Just make sure you push the door at the lower part and give it a pull ,if it moves shut the door again. The heated seats are to die for!!! The pickup bed is great and the foot holes in the bumper are great for getting into the back. I also change the oil and filter every 5000 miles. I use synthetic oil only. The engine is double overhead cam and the cams are the last thing to get oil pressure at startup.","381":"Out of the man trucks I've owned this is by far the most exciting and wonderful driving.  You save over buying a silverado so get all the options you can, they just add to the great driving experience. I really wish I could have had the colorado when my late wife did her bucket list. Every time I get in and drive this colorado I'm amazed and in awe of every part of the colorado. Thanks Chevrolet. This is my second colorado,  went from extended cab 4 cylinders to 4 door crew v6.","382":"Pros: nice ride, get lots of complements.  Cons:  for a mid size truck the height of the vehicle(getting in and out) is slightly difficult(I'm 5'11\"). You have to raise your right foot 2 feet to get into the truck.  The trucks rear end bumper is about 5 inches higher than the front.  It sits at an angle.  Level the truck off.  Lower the back end about 4-5 inches.  This would also lower getting in and out a couple of inches.  The top of the back gate is shoulder level.  Difficult getting things in and out of the back end. Had to buy a reacher like the old people use and a rake to get things out of the back end.   Again, lowering the back about 4\" would really help.  Really disappointed, NO CD player.  Everyone under the age of 30 probably has a CD collection which they can't use.  I gotta think this was done to force people to buy Sirrius\/XM with GM probably getting a cut.  Also, the factory radio antenna adds 9 more inches.  Couldn't get truck into garage.  Bought after market antenna that works fine and lowered the overall height by 5-6 inches.  Why not the shark fin antenna like the suburbans?  If GMC would level off the truck and lower it by about 3-4 inches it would be perfect.  And put the CD back in.   Got a good deal. 6700 off and 0%.","383":"This is a base model Canyon, with no real features (we're talking manual side mirror adjustments here), aside from the 308-hp V6 and towing package, and very basic 'convenience' option, including cruise control, easy-left tailgate, and a few other basics. The only other option was the gray metallic paint... No navigation, no advanced sound system, no chrome, no leather - but the vehicle is absolutely gorgeous, and performs well as a daily driver that can also tow the boat or load up for a family outing,  very pleased...","384":"I purchased a 2016 GMC Canyon sle crew cab shortly after purchasing the transmission jerks feels like it goes from 5th gear into 3rd and I can't ecelerate ... numerous trips to the dealer they can't duplicate it, power steering light is on dealer couldn't get part. And said it had a short in it ... I got the truck back only to have the light flash for steering again and check air in tires staying on!! I bought a new truck and GM could care less I'm stuck and the dealer promised me a replacement vehicle only to than ask me for a lot of money! Taken for a ride in lemon!","385":"I researched all mid-size trucks for two years before finally deciding to buy the 2016 GMC Canyon SLT. Overall exterior and interior styling, comfort, performance, technology and cost were my main deciding factors. This truck definitely meets my daily needs and I am completely satisfied!","386":"It didn't give the option for the 2.8L diesel but that's what I have and I love it.  The mpg is great I usually hover close to 30 mpg.","387":"Nice base truck","388":"The 2016 GMC  Cannon crew cab SLE V6 is without doubt, in my experience,the best value in a truck purchase . I have driven and owned many trucks of different makes and class sizes but this model holds it own to them. It is a little Pricey for that size of vehicle  but the bottom line is worth it.","389":"Overall pleased with truck even though it was in shop twice in first five weeks. Biggest  complaint is the leathet seats are not comfortable driving on long drives. Had a 2016 with cloth seats and did 9100 miles in 3 months, gteat trip. Traded it in for 4x4 drove 2600 miles and had leg circulation problem on several days. These seats are not made for the long drives at all.","390":"The starting  price, to much secrets  onthe price and all the info that you need to send before you get a price that discouraged a pitential buyet.","391":"Good pickup for older person. Rides and drives great. Not bad mileage. Don't regret buying it.","392":"The truck is to high . I can't reach the bottom of the bed. My wife can't get in it with out a stool .I had to add a receiver hitch and a 6\" drop ball mount because the bumper is 5\" higher then my old truck.   This is replacing my 92 gmc Sonoma it was just the right size. When closed the back doors are to wide and the handle hits me in the back every time I get in. The cruse control doesn't work and the right turn signal doesn't cancel after a turn. It left the factory this way It gets terrible gas mileage at 70 mph. They made a unheard of bolt pattern 6 lug on 4.72\" so my snow wheels won't fit  or any other past wheel . We don't need 16\" wheels on a small truck. Gm also made the brakes to big so you can't buy after market 15\" snow wheels. I bought the 4cly with a 6 speed auto thought I'd get better mileage then my 92's 4.3v6 and 4 speed auto but it's the same with less power.    My biggest complaint is the height","393":"I was looking for a crew cab small truck for around $20k. Unfortunately, these days you don't have many options for $20k.  Honda Ridgeline was way over priced, scarce to find a low trim model as most of the left Ridgeline was over $40k, Tacoma was also way over priced and the driving experience was horrible.  I was left with a used Frontier which is a great small truck until my local GMC dealer had a couple of left over 2016 over stock Canyons that they knock off $7k. So I got a new $29k Canyon for $22k.  For the a low trim, it is nicely equipped like electric seat, back up camera, and OnStar.  No complain so far.","394":"In really cold weather, I have had my power steering quit working. It happened to me twice. I shut the vehicle off, went in the store to purchase a few items, came back and started the vehicle. The steering was almost impossible, it also had a message to have the power steering serviced. I shut the vehicle off, restarted, and it was fine again. Kind of frightening to think if your steering went out while driving at high speed, eh? One more thing; I was getting 26mpg, but when cold weather hit, it dropped to 19mpg, which really sucks....","395":"I bought 2016gmccanyon transmissionunreliable don't know what to exspeat next dealer cant fix gm said they didn't know how to either as they were not concern cant talk get alawyer  most unreliable vehicle I ever owned sorry I ever thought about this vehicle","396":"I have had trucks, suv's for over 25 years, this is a looker but the engine is so sluggish going up the hills of Western, Pa. I can't believe how terrible the power is. It rides nice over 55 and overall nice space, front seats not real comfortable. Bose audio just ok, got a speaker rattle with anything in a decent loudness. It's a company truck so I'm can't complain but really needs a V8 for how heavy this truck is. Do not like the break assist while going down hill, i think I know how to break.","397":"I a the owner of a 2016 GMC Canyon pickup truck.  It is a quite loaded SLT model and was purchased  after the 2015 model I ordered was lost.   The warrantees and maintenance payment policies for GM vehicles changed between 2015 and 2016 .   I mentioned this to General Motors explaining my displeasure with this .   They had indicated that they would honor this with me but phone calls to them got me nowhere.  I had to bring the vehicle back to the dealer five times as the key was left in the mission and would not come out.   Communication with General Motors about this was poor as they never answer their phone offered an extended warranty but would not give anything in writing.   I am attempting to sell this vehicle at this point  and do not feel that this vehicle is a reasonable  for my 2004 Chevy Colorado.","398":"Nice truck handles well. Priced right so far so good","399":"I have had the Canyon for just a few weeks now.  I purchased the 2016 model year since there was minimal changes to the 2017 model.  I wasn't really looking for a diesel, but the more research I did made me realize it was the right choice.   Major factor for me was the reduced pricing (was able to buy for 37K + fees) -would not have bought the diesel if it was over 40k.  At that price would have gone with the Sierra.  Here are the things I really like so far: Parking is so much easier than full size truck, fits in the garage, crew cab has plenty of room for family of 4, fuel mileage, cosmetically pleasing exterior - it actually looks like a smaller version of the Sierra.  The leather interior, infotainment system and back up camera are all nice features.   I love the purr of the duramax and can't wait to tow something or go up in the mountains. Here are my complaints:  drivers seat does not have enough adjustments and not comfortable on longer drives (I bought a cushion at Costco for extra padding) I am average build, so was surprised abought the comfort level of the seating.  The cubbies in the doors are completely useless and hard plastic feels cheap.","400":"Purchased October, 2015, 20k miles. 3 recalls, oil changes and tire rotations, have been my only trips to the dealer. My first truck, surprisingly comfortable and tows my 2,000lb boat much better than my SUV. Besides the funky shifting of the transmission when accelerating from 20-30MPH it has been a super vehicle. I AVG 22MPG on my work commute, and have gotten 28MPG @ 60 MPH cruising the coast.","401":"test driving the Canyon Denali this week. I like the truck very much, but couldn't find a comfortable driving position. The power seat is lack of adjustment and the front of the seat is too tall. I decided not to purchase it. Besides that, it's a nice truck. This is a Denali, but the seat is suck.","402":"Most surprising for this 2.8L diesel was just how fun the trans\/engine combo is to drive!  Really.  In  town driving requires little more then a feather touch on the gas pedal.  The engine just pulls you along strong and the trans gets the gears right without any busy shifting.  The interior is very quiet and a smooth ride.  Fuel economy is a real world 27 in the city driving and 31 on the highway (I drive 77mph.... at 70 I get 33).  I do get a little \"wind flutter\" from the factory toneau covered bed above 55mph but you only notice it if your listening for it, which I was.  I like the style of this truck.  Just the right size for my retirement lifestyle.  Glad I put up the extra bucks for the diesel option.  PS  your review form does not offer the Longbox crew cab trim option with a diesel engine.","403":"I have previously owned 2 first gen Toyota Tundra's.  I was skeptical in going American but this was the only truck in the size range I wanted or that would fit between my narrow garage doors.  I purchased the Canyon over the Colorado because some of its features cannot be had on the Colorado (look at the instrument cluster) and the dealership prices for each were basically the same.  I have the All Terr edition which I highly recommend and also have 4 wd as I live in CO.  I drive up and down a lot of hills and get combined driving MPG of about 23.7.  My old Tundra's got 16.   The MPG drops significantly when motoring over 80 mph, but the truck feels fine at that speed.   The fit and finish have been fine and I have had truck for 8 months and have not yet been to the dealership.   The two issues I am changing on the truck are a. low front end which I have raised with an aftermarket kit and b. shift points of the transmission drive me nuts when going up small hills and again have gone with an aftermarket computer override.  I know that GM in 2017 is changing the engine (adding 3 HP and a little torque) and transmission but I can't imagine an 8 spd transmission will be well programmed for this truck.  I guess we will  have to wait and see.  I did not opt for the diesel because it  was so much more expensive and I do not trust GM with such a new engine for this market.","404":"I've had my GMC Canyon almost 2 months and so far I am very happy with it.  I start out with the Cons; at higher road speeds wind noise develops around the front windshield.  However below 60mph the cab remains very quiet.  Speech recognition for the navigation addresses runs about 60%, manual entry is needed more often then it should be.  Otherwise this thing is great.  I'm getting older and the backup camera \/ assistance really helps me not have to crank my neck around constantly when I backup.  The truck maintains it's stable feel when pulling my pontoon boat.  The interior is great and innovative; the rear seats fold down forming additional storage in the rear; we actually use it for a nice space for our dog when we go anywhere.  If you're an older guy like me you'll like the more refined, formal look of the interior.  Overall I am very satisfied with this truck; my wife enjoys driving it also.","405":"The best improvement they could make would be to lower the body by at least 3 inches.  I really doubt anyone needs the clearance it has.  I drive graveled and dirt back roads and go some rough places and don't need the height.  That makes it difficult for many [I have a bad leg] to get in and out easily.  AT the risk of voiding my warranty I'm seriously considering lowering it myself.  I test drove one with a step and it really didn't help much.  Other than that it is an excellent buy.  More than one friend has said that it rides better than most cars.  Even my wife is jealous of the ride.","406":"Transmission shifts rough.  Poor fit and finish, cheap plastic, two parts broke first week , one on the first day.  Finally got them replaced.  Oil indicator is messed up, had 53% life with 250 miles, now has 850 miles and only 40% now.  Either not reset at the factory correctly or the electronics are messed up.  The truck looks great, is fairly comfortable, just rough over bumps, but it is a truck.  I have read a lot of horror stories today about GM's customer service and that frightens me.  This is first $40,000 vehicle I have ever owned and now that I am retired I had hoped to have a good truck that would last for a long time.  I hope it does and that I don't have to deal much with customer service.  I will speak with the customer satisfaction representative tomorrow at Linus GMC and see if he can get me some help with the oil indicator issue.   I still like the truck, just hope nothing else crops up.","407":"TO; GMAC 8-2-2016\nRE; 2015 Canyon Pick up \nDear Sirs,\nHaving previous good experience with GMC I returned to your brand for my new purchases. My last GMC was a 2003 and I put nearly a quarter of a million miles on it before it was destroyed by a reckless driver. I bought the new Canyon pick-up in the winter it was running and worm when I took it for the test-drive. Which turned out to be a huge mistake on my part.\n\nI also looked at important specifications, and window sticker nomenclature.\n\n(1) The ability to tow up to 7000 LBS\n\nThis I do not believe can be done. I pull a small 8x10 trailer including cargo of just 350 lbs. I figure it was about 2500 lbs. it\u2019s like pulling a house down the road at 7 MPG. Not just handling the power plant was over rot trying to keep the rig at highway speeds without even attempting to pass ( wouldn\u2019t even consider it with the way the motor was behaving) A fifteen minute drive took nearly a quarter of a tank in gas I\u2019ve never seen anything like that EVER.\n\n(2) Gas mileage is just bad! 7-8 MPG with trailer!\n\nI may as well be driving the bigger rig this is not saving me a dime.\n\n(3) The on board computer is very slow \u2013 very, very slow.\n\nIn today\u2019s computing world this is so frustrating having to wait long periods of time more than (30) seconds to boot - to have the tools and information to proceed on a trip. It\u2019s not covered under warranty yet runs the entire truck so if it quits. Well that\u2019s a problem. now the screen keeps blacking out even after being in for repair on this issue.\n\n(4) Acceleration letting off the gas on a freeway ramp or navigating traffic and re-pressing the gas to find the motor (missing) no power!\n\nThis happens allot and it\u2019s a terrible issue. The shop said (\u201cthey are aware of that, it\u2019s within spec\u201d)\nThe motor behaves like it\u2019s stalling when the gas is re-applied \u2013 so, frustrating and a little scary when trying to get on a highway.\n\n(5) Maps that are way out of date.\n\nI travel daily and find that the navigation does not include neighborhood\u2019s that have been established for 5 or more years.\n\n(6) Under-powered\n\nGranted I\u2019m used to a V8 but was told that \u201cTHIS HAS ALL THE POWER OF AN OLD V8\u201d in your nomenclature and advertising.\n\nIn short; I do not believe that you\u2019re advertising, window sticker, sales team or nomenclature was truthful about what I could expect from this (Professional grade) truck. I\u2019ve had it in the shop 4 times in 10,000 miles. I\u2019m a self-employed and this was a major deal for me \u2013 Now being told the truck is running at specification. I\u2019m really stuck. Tried to trade out of it only to be told I would get less than 3\/4 its value so that\u2019s a no go -- to be that upside-down. I do not know where to turn, this unit is not anything like what I was told it could do. There are other nuisances, what were you thinking - things that I could live with, but the power and towing is unacceptable! I have talked to other people what have the exact same experience- issues I\u2019m having with this new truck!","408":"First of all, I need to ding edmunds for not even listing the model with a Diesel engine. The engine is great. Love the vehicle but I am outraged that the first gravel road I went on, gravel blasted the protruding portion of the rear wheel area. Vehicle should have had mud flaps on the front.  You should demand flaps be put on by your dealer.  At least recommended.  I will bash GMC on reviews on this everywhere I can. Major oversight on GMCs part.","409":"Some of these vehicles have issues knowing when to shift. I have had this truck back to the dealer countless times for this issue. I have even had the region service tech work on the truck twice. The story is the same \"it is a characteristic of this model\"   what a very poor excuse for GMC. They have no idea what they need to do to fix this. I have complained to GM as well as the dealership and NO ONE does anything.  I am a very regular buyer of GM vehicles. one every 16-24 month's.  After this experience I will never own another GM vehicle again or work with the dealership. Thankfully I leased the thing so I can walk away in 36 mo.","410":"I just got this puppy a month ago and it's been a great drive so far. Got the hard to get 2.8l diesel at a fantastic price and then got up sold the extended warranty which I'm not so sure I need .. Did it because the 2.8l diesel is new in the USA ( tho not new in Asia apparently).. Truck accelerates good enough for highway but does even better passing over 50 because of torque . Going up hill the truck doesn't sweat it. Gas mileage is great which really hooked me. But we will see how diesel prices out I've the years and whether it was a good decision vs getting the regular gas v6 .. Slt vs Denali? I say save your money and stick with the slt..","411":"Great small truck. 2.8 diesel is something to consider.","412":"2016 Models do not have a CD\/MP3 player. I listen to a lot of books on CD. Now I have to convert to a thumb drive to listen. However, that is not to say that I don't love this truck. I travel extensively on business and hate airports - so...if it's less that 12 hours, I drive. I've owned Ford Tauruses in the past and I always thought they were a comfortable ride, until the Canyon. No fatigue, and I could drive it a long way without having a sore butt! Even my wife says it is more comfortable than her 2015 Buick Enclave! I'm sold on this truck, even though I had wished that Ford had a mid-size! Ford's loss!","413":"I have a Loaded SLT long bed 4X4 with the new Duramax Diesel engine. I love this truck!! It has great power once the turbo spools up. It takes a second for this to happen so there is a slight hesitation upon sudden acceleration but for the size of this motor it pulls really well. I paid $42,100 before tax and license which is a bit much but better than 60 grand for a full size diesel truck. The canyon is no small truck. It has a 6'2\" bed (long bed) that is large enough for most loads and it still fits in my garage. I get 23mpg around town and 28 highway witch isn't bad at all. The technology is amazing. You can send or receive text messages without ever taking you hands off the wheel or eyes off the road and the bose stereo sounds great! The exhaust brake (jake brake) is a nice little feature that will extend brake life too! I highly recommend this truck to anyone looking for a midsize truck they can fit in their garage and still handle all the tasks the average light duty truck owner has. Its not cheap but far better than the toyota tacoma or nissan frontier. I am sold on this little diesel engine.","414":null,"415":"Needed something with more room and better carrying capability than the Jeep I was driving. Walked in to the dealer and saw they had 2 of the new Canyons with the 2.8L Duramax engine. Was an expensive up grade from the 3.6L gas BUT having owned it a month totally worth it:\n\n1. Around town\/highway getting 25 mpg avg\n2. On a recent drive from Portland OR to San Francisco it did it on one tank of diesel (it must hold more than 21 gallons when topped off) and with it showing 30 mpg at highway speeds all the way (plus its 4WD)\n3. Fully loaded with 5 adults and 5 sets of camping gear in the Mountains you would think it was hauling just me, the engine and gear box are fantasic.\n\nMy wife did not like the ride or roughness of the Jeep so when I bought this I did not tell her it was a diesel, it was only a week later, having riden in it a number of times, she was stood next to it when I used the remote start that she said \"your engine is making a funny noise\"\n\nOver all car like ride on the open road, pick up truck for carrying loads (same length but slightly narrow than a full size truck) and an engine that as all the power I need and then more but makes me smile when I see the price of diesel is $0.50 lower than gas where I live.","416":"Great ride ,very quiet cabin, good fuel economy for a truck, 6 cylinder has plenty of power. A pleasure to drive, you would not think you were driving a truck. A lot of tech features if you like that kind of stuff.","417":"So far so great. Driving this for the past month had exceeded my expectations for this truck\n\nI've been getting so many compliments on the looks of this truck. It's a mid size truck but the front end looks so nice. It's just the right size for maneuvering and also hauls wel\n\nI really recommend test driving the canyon\/Colorado before thinking about the Tacoma. \n\nI test drove the Tacoma vs the GMs several times.  As far as driveability there was no doubt I had to go with the Canyon. \n\nNoise- for a mid size segment this is second to none in noise and quiet cabin. Everyone I've driven this in has made comments about how nice it drives and comfortable it is for a truck\n\n(Note. I plan to update this review later )","418":"What a great little truck!\nThe interior is excellent and the exterior is stylish!\nI ordered the Base Model with vinyl seats (no extra charge) V-6 and 4WD. \nI also have the basic radio and no carpeting.\nIt's a truck! It hauls, pulls and handles great on or off road.\nGreat value if you stick to the basics!\nNo on star, no computer screen, no crappy cloth seats and no carpet.\nIf you are looking for a TRUCK, build your own using the GMC build your own tool.\nYou'll be surprised what the base model has to offer!\n2 YRS free maintenance  + 5 YR \/ 100,000 MI extended warranty.\nAll of this for UNDER $30,000!\nCompare with Tacoma, Frontier and Colorado, the Canyon has way more options and is not over priced.","419":"I drove this car once and was so excited about buying it. Then drove it again, and decided to wait and maybe buy it in the future. I was looking at the crew cab, short box, sle with all-terrain. First-off, let's talk $36-39k for a mid-size truck. For nearly 40k, I expect some level of awesomeness. The front power seats don't have a tilt adjustment, and in the SLE (leather trimmed, cloth middle) they are just a tad on the firm side. Rear sliding window is manual. No manual locker on the All-terrain pkg (though it does have a type of locking differential). Short bed is very short: cannot put a bicycle length-wise standing up with both wheels on without the gate down. Stereo was great, interior styling excellent. No push button start (personally I prefer a key). The V6 is good, but noisy when stepping on the gas hard and really the 265 lb-ft of torque isn't enough for something that weighs 4000+ pounds. If this truck was $28k, I'd buy it now. But I think the prices will drop. For $38k you can get a very nice full-size truck (though don't many of us want something smaller?) that probably weighs about the same and has a much more powerful engine. If they could have tuned the gasoline v6 to a bit more torque and improved the seats to the level of the Sierra, I would think this truck could be a $38k vehicle. I plan on waiting a year and buying one when the prices drop or buying one used. Just not a good value as priced. The engine noise\/torque were the main detractors. I did test the vehicle off-road and it performed well and the hill-descent feature was nice.","420":"Good fuel milage between 20 and 27 \nGreat turning radius \nComfortable  \nA enjoyably  ride overall \nWas involved in a accident  where hit in passenger front tire and flipped on it side and was totaled \nMy son in passenger front seat and I both walked away with minor injuries \nThankfully \nOnstar  great to have","421":"Pay the extra for the Canyon over the Chevy Colorado, you won't be sorry.","422":"I'm a little over 1,000 miles in on my 2016 SLE w\/ All Terrain and am really enjoying the truck.  Remote start is awesome, although I am overusing it a bit so it did ding the gas mileage.  Overall I'm in the 19s, on highway only trips it gets around 21\/22.  All Terrain tires probably does not help.  I had experience with a Ford Ranger in the 90s and as expected this is light years beyond.  In some ways it exceeds the interior of the Mercedes I traded in, although the Mercedes did have some bells and whistles this does not, such as dual zone climate control.  While some reviewers do not like the infotainment, I think it works quite well and like it better than the Mercedes, and the voice activation is really easy to use.  I did notice on some hilly highway driving it had to downshift to keep up at 65\/70 mph, but otherwise have had no problem with power or acceleration.  I'm coming from Xenon headlights versus the Halogen that comes standard here and I will probably look into brighter lights at some point.  Overall, I love the look, comfort and capability of this truck, very happy with the purchase.","423":"Wanted a SLT CC LB 2WD. Unfortunately for some reason the two local dealers decided that anyone wanting a LB would get it in white and the cloth seats of a SLE trim. A 6' bed isn't what I would call a long bed but definitely better than a 5' bed. Again only in white so that was that and ended up with a SB. Ride isn't the greatest but will wait till 5K miles when everything is broken in before upgrading to Bilsteins and those brake pads need to go as I can't be rinsing down the rims everytime I drive the truck due to that black residual dust. For me I just wanted out of a full sized truck and didn't care for the Toyota leaving the only other options a Canyon or a Colorado.","424":"This is a really nice truck.  Exceptional ride, handling and interior comfort with a very quiet cab.  Fit and finish is excellent and the 8-inch color touchscreen is remarkable.  Full-size trucks are too big for my needs and although the Canyon is large, it drives like a mid-sized car  Gas mileage is around 22 mpg mixed city\/hwy and 25 mpg pure hwy.  The Canyon is a great alternative to a full-size truck or SUV.\nUPDATE - Have now had the truck for 6 months and 4200 miles.  Still love it.  Best 50 mile trip mpg is 28.5 mpg.  Especially like the Android Auto feature - no need for factory navigation.  I feel like I should list some negatives, but there are so few.  Front seats could be a bit wider, would like built in Homelink and rear parking sensors.  Overall = A+","425":"Very comfortable ride, just like being in a car. Not \"trucky\" at all.
