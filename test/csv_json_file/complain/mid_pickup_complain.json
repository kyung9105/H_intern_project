window open and the front windows closed. My heart rate flow out of control I thought I had 4 flat tires. I contacted Honda and took it to the service area they told me that that is normal. I had a 2007 Honda Ridgeline for 7 years and that was not a issue. I believe they this is a flaws in the design. I have contacted Honda corporation and they too told me that that is the norm they offered me 200 $ and basically told me to deal with it. I refused the offer. Please advise me what I can do thank you-Sebastian, FL, USA","1":"The car has collision avoidance breaking but I noticed a time when a collision was not going to occur and the breaks were applied without me actually applying the breaks. I could have been rearended if there was a car behind be because there was no need to break. A car was a few hundred feet in front of me turning right at an intersection in my lane, and then I was traveling about 35mph and going straight through the intersection. The car had completed its turn in front of me and as I approached where the car was, it applied the breaks as if the car was still there but it had previously cleared the lane by 5 seconds or so. There was no need to break and caused me to be to potentially be harmed by that breaking action. The car slowed down to about 15mph before allowing me to continue.-Middletown, PA, USA","2":"will not start. shows multiple errors of main dash displayThe problem has occurred before and it went into dealer who checked computer error messages. First they thought it was the switch attached to the brake which needs to be pushed to start so that was replaced. Worked fine for a while then started again. Next time in to dealer and they replaced the wiring harness that was part of recall. Seem to work fine for a while then started happening again.It appeared to be related to vehicle sitting out in the rain overnight so I made sure to park in garage when raining. Seemed to work but again problem has resurfaced without rain.Basically you enter vehicle as usual and press start button and the main display starts going through a number of error messages and the truck won't start. I turn everything off and try again. Same effect. And again. Same thing. Being persistent and having to get somewhere I continue to try and after usually a dozen attempts it starts. While fine then. Error messages still appear but everything seems to be function correctly. As day goes on, error messages seem to autocorrect and disappear and within an hour or two its like it never happened. It might be good for a couple of days or a month then bang, back to same issue.This last time I have tried over 20 start processes and still no luck. Its going to dealer one way or the other and will be fixed or time for lawyers to be brought in.","3":"Computer seems to have a mind of its own.

I found it also did not display audio controls, volume and station data; the main display operated normally. I pulled over and restated the truck and after re-booting the display operated correctly. I took a video of the display when it was not working and after I restarted the truck to possibly show the dealer.I was not sure of what I did prior to the display going blank since I assume this is a software problem requiring software update to correct it. This is not a major problem, but it is a pain in the butt to lose this information displayed directly in front of the driver. And when you pay for a capability I expect it to work.Update from Feb 23, 2017:Just wanted to clarify that the other multi function display modes, trip odometer A & B, tire pressure, oil status, Etc all worked properly.","7":"unlock does not unlock all doorsCode of Conduct Violation.

I could have been rearended if there was a car behind be because there was no need to break. A car was a few hundred feet in front of me turning right at an intersection in my lane, and then I was traveling about 35mph and going straight through the intersection. The car had completed its turn in front of me and as I approached where the car was, it applied the breaks as if the car was still there but it had previously cleared the lane by 5 seconds or so. There was no need to break and caused me to be to potentially be harmed by that breaking action.

Bolts at threads showing aggressive rust and bleed down on other aluminum parts. There are no after market replacement parts and therefore seeming no fix except to remove, sand blast and perhaps surface coat external surface areas. Bolts should be replaced with non-rusting steel. Problem will continue to grow more severe untreated. In my opinion a significant quality issue that is a buyers deal breaker if known.Update from May 25, 2017:Honda America representative called and discussed on two occasions with Company conclusion that the situation was normal and such would not effect performance or quality of vehicle. Complainant admits his comment was in error, noting rust even on Fords.

Just seems like from a stop, to 35-40 MPH you hear what sounds like a high dollar industrial sewing machine. You would think by now Toyota would insulate the engine bay much better, (call Ford, they'll tell you how). and someone would've gotten the gear ratio right\/better than what is being used today. Once you get past the 45 MPH mark, the truck glides nice...........it's just that low starting section and the lack of engine bay insulation.

Both times this occurred while creeping in 5pm traffic jam traveling less than 10 mph. Not sure if its some type of unplanned detonation, on the first incident it was severe enough to make me think I was hit by a vehicle. Never experienced anything like this from fords, jeeps, chevys, hondas, and previous fj, tacoma, and 4runner. Not sure if an electrical interference, gases in intake due to engine design cycle, or engine to torque converter issues. Toyota has assigned a file number and told me to get it to a dealer.

On Monday, December 5th I drove to work and didn't notice anything unusual about the drive. I don't recall anything striking the windshield that morning. When I left work that afternoon, I noticed a crack in the windshield coming from the bottom corner on the passenger side. Upon inspection, it appears that something may have struck the windshield about 1\/2\" above the wiper blade and caused about a 3\" crack. I found it odd that something could have struck the windshield that far down. I have not had this issue replaced yet as I wanted to get through the holiday season. I drove to work again this morning (12\/27\/2016), and again was not listening to the radio. I did not hear anything strike the windshield. When I got in the truck at lunch time, I noticed a star where something struck the windshield about 8\" above the wiper on the passenger side. It had to have been something extremely small to strike it and not make any noise to alert me, yet it still damaged the windshield.I have called Toyota to see if this is a recurring issue and was told they were not aware of any issues.

I feel like I have to fight to keep it in the lane. It is terrifying when it happens. The truck will even pull to the high side of the lane (not necessarily following gravity).I have taken it in to Toyota 5 times for the issue but they just tell me it is fine. Sometimes wind, and sometimes when it is wet. Since it doesn't happen all the time, they just say until they experience it, then I am a liar. I have no formula on how to replicate it. I have never had any issue like it before. I have followed other 3rd generation stock TRD Tacomas on the highway and watched them drive straight with no issues when I was swerving all over the place.I have talked to Toyota corporate but they weren't really much help.

Then at that point I am able to use the up and down arrow on the left steering wheel control to just go through the particular album iam in.

It is clear that the underside of the hood has a bracing frame, and you can clearly see that whatever adhesive was used to secure the bracing to the hood has failed, resulting in over 50% of the attachment 'points' failing. Took it to the dealership and they said \"This is normal\".I've owned over 20 vehicles in my life, none of those had 'vibrating hoods' as standard equipment.

They won't even fix an obvious defect in their manufacturing process.","48":"There is a howling noise coming from the drivers side Door around the mirror. It occurs at about 60 miles per hour and appears to be worse when there is a cross wind. It is sporadic based on the wind and speed conditions.","49":"When driving in a cross wind the noise is at the front top corner of the door on the down wind side. It sounds like holding a blade of grass in your hands and blowing on the blade of grass. If you put a finger in the area you can feel the door move in and out from the wind so it is likely that this is a door seal issue the outer seal seems to buzz with the cross wind.","50":"when on freeway , doing anywhere from 70 mph ( but more at over 80 mph ), the truck starts to develop a whistling noise.

I took it in to our local Toyota dealer and I was told, \"Sorry, there is nothing we can do....Can't have our techs test driving over the speed limit....\" I asked them to note it and inform Toyota... there must be something they can do in wind tunnels or some way to check into this ? And I don't think I am the only one having this issue. They said they would, but I don't believe it.

They then said it could be the weather guard because they have seen that several times before. Was fine for a bit then a windy day came and I could not even bear driving too much because it was impossibly loud. I could not even turn the radio up enough to overcome the terrible sound coming out of the passenger side.

This still did not resolve the problem. Brought the vehicle back a 3rd time and they didn't see a problem with the vehicle.

Drove it a couple more days and noticed the cruise control was non existent. I drive a lot for work and use it a ton and all of a sudden it wouldn't even bring the light on or work at all. The next day started driving and the real issues started. Turned truck on; same problems I have been having; then the truck would not shift. Kept going and going till I was getting to 5000rpm and it shifted with a tremendous amount of force. Once it shifted the whole truck did a huge jerk then went a little more an did a double shift totally bypassing the 3rd gear. I turned it off and started it again. Kept having the same problem all day. I called the dealership and they said get it to them when I could and they would take a look. Almost caused several accidents trying to get the brand new $35,000 truck that didn't work to the dealership almost running into the people in front of me who cut me off because I can't go over 40mph on the freeway and I have no control of the violent shifting moving the whole truck. Needless to say the dealership tried to blame me for all of these problems that I could not have possibly cause if I tried and that my brand new truck with 10,000miles on it was fine just needed a couple sensors. Obviously this is not working and I think sensors are the least of the worries.-Canal Winchester, OH, USA","68":"While driving 40-60 mph (speed where problem is the greatest) any time the truck is accelerated but not to the point it downshifts the truck constantly shakes\/shudders. As soon as I back off the gas, the problem disappears, accelerating again repeats the problem. It's best to describe the problem occurs is when your \"lugging\" the engine. The shake\/shudder happens numerous times a second and is not an even occurrence. It does take a smooth road to separate the truck bounce from the shudder. I did take it to the dealer, they ran their analyzer and took it for a ride, they claim they couldn't find an issue, or they couldn't repeat the issue. This is becoming more and more annoying now that i'm aware of what it takes to repeat the issue. Most of my driving falls right into the speed range where it's most apparent.","69":"2nd Complaint I've got on my \"new\" truck.Piston knocking\/slapping when the truck accelerates from around 1200RPM @40MPH.First things First: I'm using 91 to 93 oct Gas since day 1.It started doing it uphill, since the transmission shifts too soon, sometimes when going uphill the RPM's drop\nunder 2000. When I step on the pedal to accelerate it . .. Piston knocking right away for a few seconds, then it stops. Whenever the truck goes under the 1200RPM and I need to accelerate again, it knocks. And I'm not confusing this sound with the valve sound (the sewing machine sound) that Toyota still saying that \"it's normal\". I know what piston knock\/slap is and that sound can't be confused. At first I thought I was a casual thing, but it started to doing it even on the Highway.According to the advantages of an Atkinson Engine: piston knocking is virtually \"impossible\" or less likely to happen because of the Direct Injection system. When fuel injection happens inside the chamber it is supposed to cool it down to prevent pre-ignition due to overheating. I hope to got this right. Well, if it is not a matter of high temperatures at the combustion chamber, then could it be a too lean air\/fuel mixture. And this could explain that hesitation feeling when accelerating\/lugging the engine. We know now that there's an under power feeling due to the transmission shifting too soon to higher gears, but this might a stacking issue as well.Things I found weird....MPG. Frequently this truck is giving me more than 28MPG. That's weird. I mean, or something is f.ckd up, or the MPG calculations are wrong or the ECU just want to save fuel or run the truck with air only ?I took the truck to the dealer, and guess what ? They didn't find a thing and they've stated that my truck is on spec. I'm taking it back to the dealer again an try to contact Toyota corp. because this is something that needs to be addressed and fixed accordingly.I'm posting this complaint here because I haven't heard of this before and I really don't know if this is an isolated issue, but the truth is it is not acceptable on a new car.","70":"At approx. 50mph (gentle cruising) and at 1,200 to 1,300 rpm it seems like the engine is skipping or misfiring. It runs fine under load or at idle.","71":"a repeating problem since I have purchased the truck of a surging problem {engine idling acceleration} that pushes the truck when backing up, or going forward at low speeds when pulling in or out of the garage. Brought it in 4 times for this problem. Dealer said can't duplicate problem.","72":"2016 TOYOTA TACOMA SURGE IN POWERWhen I start the truck to pull in or out of a parking spot at an idle and turn the steering wheel in either direction the rpms will rise and the truck will surge forward or reverse. The truck will surge every time you stop turning and turn the other way .I have had truck in for repair , 1st time it was low on transmission fluid from factory, 2nd they flashed computer, 3rd time Toyota response was it is running as designed !!!!!!! . Why would you want a vehicle that surges in speed , when parking in tight spots , backing up to a trailer, driving on ice, backing a boat up to the lake ??????? Toyota why would I want a vehicle to do this , Please explain to me.Other truck buyers do you want you truck to do this, if not I would not buy a Toyota Tacoma. Pat Lobb Toyota of McKinney Texas has Another Tacoma that does the exact same thing.","73":"Toyota Tacoma 2016 on reaching the working temperature 95C the vehicle is turned off, DTC P0300, when cooling turns back on without failure when arriving at the temperature regime goes off and thus cyclically, What is your opinion?","74":"I was driving 40MPH (80kmph) then the engine stalled and loss power including brake and power steering. I was able to use e brake to stop. I Tried to start the truck many times but failed. The worst part was it happened during rush hour in the morning. I never seen so many angry driver in an early morning because the truck stalled on the exit of a highway blocking the middle lane. Toyota roadside assistance was terrible, it took them 2 hours to bring someone to tow the truck and this is in the city. Toyota roadside assistance kept assuming that I ran out of gas. A good company should not assume!","75":"Truck has stalled out on me 4 different times. Toyota dealer just had it for 4.5 weeks, had Toyota engineers out to look at it and can not find the problem.","76":"I have never had a problem with a Tacoma, I have owned 3 and NEVER been left on the side of the road!. I traded a 01 with over 100,000 miles on it and wish I had it back!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am very disappointed in the quality of my NEW Tacoma. I don't fault the dealership at all. They have went above and beyond to help me, When the truck left me stranded on the road in 95 degree weather the first time is was pissed. All lights came on, the a\/c quit, the engine stalled and died. It was towed in and the dealer took care of me with a loaner and kept the truck a week before they found and fixed a fuse block that was loose. Then 3 or 4 days later the damn dash lights and battery light came on again and well here we go. This time they worked on it for a few days and told me they are calling in a Toyota specialist to come down to fix it?... Really?.. Again I don't fault the dealer at all. They are working to keep my business and I appreciate that a lot. I think this truck should have not been released until all the bugs were out of it. Toyota has one more chance at this truck then I get a lemon law lawyer. A truck with 9,000 miles on it should never do this!!!!! I am used to Toyota standing for quality not junk!!!!!!!!!!.","77":"On 11\/23\/15 I was able to take possession of the vehicle. On 11\/24\/15 I got into the vehicle to crank it up when the vehicle's warning lights of brake, ABS warning to check the anti\u017clock brake system and check brake system and the antiskid\/traction lights came on at approximate 110 miles. I immediately called the dealership and was told that it would not hurt the vehicle to drive it and that it was safe. I was told that it was probably just a fuse by a salesperson, who allegedly talked to one of the master technicians about the situation. On 11\/30\/15 I also reported that the cruise control was also not working to the service department when I arrive at the dealership. The vehicle was diagnosed with a bad left rear speed sensor at 185 miles and again that the vehicle was safe to drive. On 12\/04\/15 at 334 miles the sensor was replaced. As I was going home on the interstate highway and less than 10 miles away, the same lights and warning readouts came back on. I immediately turned the vehicle around and proceeded back to the dealership. On my way back to the dealership while slowing down, a loud metallic banging\/rattle could be heard coming from the rear end. When I got back to the dealership, I explained the same symptoms happened again as before and that now clanging\/rattle in the rear end had developed to the service manager. At approximately 4:00P.M., I received a call from the service department and was told that a rear wheel bearing was not installed correctly from the factory, that it had done some damage and that the parts were ordered. I expressed my concerns about possible other damage such as the brakes, tire, sensors or the rear housing and safety of the vehicle.-Wytheville, VA, USA","78":"I purchased this on 6\/28\/2016, exactly 11 months later, on 5\/28\/2017, the check engine light comes on when I went out for lunch, the check engine light stayed on. Another light \"TRAC OFF\" came on and off.I called the dealer where I purchased the vehicle from and they asked me to take the truck in, which I did.After about one hour or so, they told me the engine \"knocking\" very severely and they had to keep the truck for further diagnosis. I ended up taking a rental vehicle, which was paid for by Toyota. Six days have passed and I still do not know what needs to be done to repair it; I am still driving the rental.This is my first new Toyota. Very disappointed.","79":"I purchase my TRD in July. It has 5500miles. I was heading home after hunting and while doing 45mph to stopped moving forward. The check engine light , transmission light, oil pressure and traction control light came on. It looked like a Christmas tree. What a nice present to have.I had to have it flat bedded 40miles back to the dealer. It looks like no hunting trips for me using this dependable truck........The dealer told me fuel injection codes. They have no clue on how to fix the problem claims it's too new. They had to call a Toyota specialist to advise. It's still there after 7 days. Should have bought a Ford?","80":"I got my TRD Sport 4x4 in Oct 2015, and under 2000 miles in Nov 2015 the truck completely stopped. In the dash I got the engine light on and oil pressure low. Took it to the dealer, after some diagnose (fuel injection) and been completely apart they put it back together and worked fine again. Now Feb 2016, it happened again, same as before, I got the engine light on and oil pressure low, plus A\/F Fluid warning. Was not able to drive. Took it to the dealer last week, and still awaiting from Toyota, to sent a specialist to the dealer.","81":"engine light on and tracs light on\nvery disappointing for only having 2000 km on truck \nthe cruise control won't work now either\nhad a 2005 tacoma 4x4 trd for 11 years and never had a engine warning light come on\nhope this is not the start of problem truckUpdate from Jan 21, 2016:for some reason after owning three tacomas the gas cap was almost falling off this is what the mechanic said\nnever had this problem before my only thought is that some one tried to steal gas from my vehicle","82":"Had 2010 Tacoma.....loved it!

Sounds like a bad diesel! I have taken it to the dealership with no suggestions whatsoever on a fix.....beyond annoying!! Come on a Toyota.... you can do better!!! You have a reputation for quality but the 2016 doesn't cut it nor does it get my vote or recommendation. $38k + and I don't even want to drive it. Please do something!! Totally disappointed!!!","83":"New tacoma sr5 4x4. 4500 miles .Engine sounds like a 25 year old car with bad lifters! ticks like crazy. TOYOTA listen up. You guys need to take responsibility for your loud noisey injector cleaners. When my wife rides in the car and say\" this cant be right ...its noisy... is it ok ... I wont drive it? 38grand. and the seat cant be raised....love the truck..... but not the noise!!!","84":"I was so excited to buy my 2016 Tacoma TRD 4X4 SPORT and now I am questioning my purchase. The engine is very loud with clicking sound just like a diesel motor. I have taking it to the dealer 3 times now and they can not find anything. Don't know what to do. Can someone help?","85":"The engine is noisy. I checked with the dealer and I was told that this noise is typical on all models. I was checking this webside to find out if this was true.","86":"This truck is the noisiest vehicle I've ever owned, the loud tick tick tick tick tick tick sounds like you are driving a diesel, it's unacceptable for a 38k dollar vehicle, I don't care it's a truck, I've had 2 other Toyota Trucks and they were quiet. It doesn't just tick tick tick at certain times like others have reported the injectors are cleaning, it's a ticking time bomb all the time, to the point that frankly I just want to get rid of it. The GM trucks don't tick, the Ford trucks don't tick, the Dodge trucks don't tick, unless you buy a diesel, then you can expect some engine noise. Maybe that fake hood scoop amplifies the noise, I shouldn't be the one to try this or try that, I paid Toyota a lot of money to do that after I bought the truck, it's called R and D, something Toyota seems to have forgotten how to do. Probably will be my last Toyota vehicle.","87":"Brand new TRD Offroad. I have read many others with the same vibration at 2,000 RPMS-2,300 RPMS causing a hand numbing vibration in the steering wheel and the same vibration in the floor, foot pearl and seat as well......I am sure they meant to design that in but it sucks on long tripsI have been lucky enough to have already replaced the rear leaf springs, rear drum brakes and all 4 tires. I also have the same brake pump annoyance in the brake pedal (Like a small motor vibrating) I also get a slight clunk before the brakes engage.My alignment is already out and the transmission shifting is awful even after the latest computer upgrade.I hate this truck and feel ripped off completely. I wish Subaru made trucks","88":"20 days out from break down. No parts available. There were timing issues as well as brake issues. Been in contact with Toyota Corporate. local dealer lying to me...I was told on Monday 11\/9 parts were in and my truck was in the shop getting worked on. The fact is on Tuesday at 6am I walked onto the lot and found my truck in the same location, wheels turned at same angle as well as the bed of the truck overhanging the back edge of space.This was the closest dealer to break down not where I purchased. I went to dealer I purchased from, I told them what happened and asked for a replacement. No apology at all for trouble Sales manager told me in a Nut shell \"I gave you a good deal on the truck thats all I can do for you\". He then got up to walk away. I responded \"No F you, No Im sorry this happened to you, no nothing. He responded yea I'm very sorry this happened.","89":"This is a serious issue in a brand new truck. The gas pedal, steering wheel, and floorboard have a vibration (felt, not seen) at around 2000 rpm. It gets so bad that my feet and sometimes hands will go numb. I was hoping after 10,000 miles it would work itself out. Actually, it's getting worse. If Toyota does not come out with a fix for this, this will be my first and last Toyota ever. I've also had several other issues with the truck and have had it in the shop 3 times. This is ridiculous for a brand new truck. My Nissans and Dodges never had a problem and were never in the shop except for scheduled maintenance.","90":"I waited a year for the new 2016 Tacoma. This was the most expensive vehicle I ever purchased [$41,000]. Since this was my second Tacoma and 6th Toyota I felt comfortable spending the $41 K and I also tolerated the wait.I had read about the numerous complaints concerning a \u201cbuzzy vibration in the gas pedal, floor boards and steering wheel\u201d posted all over the Internet. I was a little concerned so when I actually received the truck I took a long test drive and the truck was smooth as glass, no vibrations present. I figured that this must have been a few GMC sales guys posting. Turns out, I was very wrong and all V6 engines either have the vibration at delivery or will develop it down the road. Biggest regret and worst vehicle I ever owned.So where is the vibration coming from? Turns out, Toyota used cheap rubber engine mounts on this $41,000 truck. When the engine breaks in it settles and the vibration comes from the engine shifting between Atkinson and Otto cycles to save fuel. Ironically, Toyota took this engine from the Lexus which uses both electronic and hydraulic engine mounts. Save a few bucks and use rubber\u2026Do you self a favor and buy a truck with hydraulic engine mounts [they are out there] if you need a compact truck. I sold mine shortly thereafter.","91":"Gas pedal buzzes\/vibrates on acceleration through most RPMS. During extended acceleration periods, vibration can cause numbness in the foot. Like others have said, it requires you to shift position, use cruise control, and shift gears to get out of the main vibration range. Toyota continues to receive complaints about this issue, but keeps denying that this is even a problem to begin with. I have never experienced this issue on any other car, no matter how old or beat up the vehicle was. This issue needs to be resolved ASAP! If you have the same issue, report it now and call Toyota Corporate to let them know that this is unacceptable.","92":"This truck has a strong buzzing, metal on metal vibration when I accelerate through the 2,000-2,500 RPM range. I too can feel it strongly in the steering wheel and gas pedal. According to Toyota, the truck is operating under design specifications. You read that correctly: Toyota said they DESIGNED the truck to do that. They're \"sorry I do not like it.\" Buyer beware.","93":"My new 2016 Tacoma has a nasty, pronounced buzzing vibration in the steering wheel, gas pedal, and floorbed when accelerating through 2,000-2,500 RPMs. The buzzing vibration is best described as having your hands and foot on a powerful sanding machine. It is powerful enough to carry through to your skin and clothes. Now there are weaker buzzing vibrations in the steering wheel and gas pedal in other ranges from 1,000-2,000 RPMs. When you're driving through mountain or hilly terrain for long distances, the engine often works for long periods in the peak 2,000-2,500 range; the resonant vibration is so intense and uncomfortable that I find myself having to drive with two little fingers on the wheels, constantly rotating, and finding ways to put it in cruise control so I can get my foot off the gas pedal.I have had my truck evaluated by the service department and Toyota corporate multiple times since October. They say it's \"engine resonance.\" The last update I received from Toyota Corporate claimed that, \"for now, this is a normal characteristic\" of the truck because others they evaluated had the same issue, though they concede to a lesser extent than mine. So the corporate logic goes something like this: most trucks have the same \"issue\" to some degree; ergo, it is not a problem but rather \"normal and characteristic\"--a \"feature,\" if you will. Imagine paying $38K+ for a cup of coffee that started leaking all over you the minute you walked out the door. You go back in to the coffee shop to point it out. The barista tries another cup that also leaks (maybe it's a better cup because it doesn't leak so bad). The barista then logically concludes \"this other cup leaks so it's normal!\" Leaky is the new normal! The bottom line: that a preponderance of trucks exhibit an issue does not make it \"normal\" and erase the fact that there may be a serious problem.To make matters worse, I have test-drove many other 2016 Tacoma models that do not have a hint of this issue. I only found it on one of the many I test drove, and that one had it so minor no normal person would notice it. I'd be happy to have it at that level on my truck. So because this strong vibration is present on my truck and is a \"normal characteristic,\" the non-vibrating trucks are \"abnormal\" and \"uncharacteristic.\"I had a 2014 Tacoma that never had anything close to this issue. It was awesome. I am disappointed by Toyota's carefully crafted and downplayed response to this issue so far and hope they do the right thing and fix this soon. For others considering the 2016 Tacoma, be sure to thoroughly test drive your truck before taking delivery. But also be forewarned that many others had it develop after a few hundred miles after driving it off the lot. Yet, you may get lucky and get one of those cups\/trucks \"that just don't leak.\"","94":"Vibration in foot and wheel above 60 mph. Why can't a company like Toyota fix thissh*t. It's always the Tacoma, it's ridiculous. They guaranteed not a problem with the new design once out. Should have kept the Nissan Pro4x 2016. Nissan NEVER sees a shop unless to change oil.","95":"So, this $40k truck has a very buzzy vibration in both the steering wheel and in the footwell\/floorboard at 2100-2300RPM in any gear. This equates to many of the freeway speeds of 70 or high 70's that you travel in my area and I travelled 250 miles from Flagstaff, AZ to Las Vegas and my hands went to sleep from the steering wheel buzzy vibration. Really noticeable in the 5th or 6th speeds in the automatic transmission, which are both overdrives. Took it to the dealer and the master Tech said he noticed it in other trucks of the same model, too. Said the problem may just be 'normal' for this vehicle. Agreed that it was not acceptable and thought Toyota would have to either re-design the engine\/trans mounts or provide some way to dampen this. Have tested it around town and found it to be in all gears. Dealer recommended that I call Toyota directly as there is nothing they can do. This is supposedly a completely 'redesigned' model with a new engine and tranny. Checking on various forums, it seems that many people with automatic transmissions and 4x2's of any trim and 4x4's of Limiteds and Sport models have this issue in one way or another and the only model that seems to not have it is the 4x4 Off-Road model. I wonder if this is because the Off-Road has a different transfer case with Crawl Control, which is not present on the other models???This is completely UNACCEPTABLE in any new vehicle and I am hoping Toyota will address this soon. It sure takes the excitement of owning a new vehicle and throws it out the window. The truck is, overall, nice and fits my needs; however, I will not be able to keep it if the vibration can't be quelled. Trading it will lose me thousands of dollars. I've owned many Toyotas over the years (currently have this truck and an Avalon) and, if this is not fixed, I will NEVER buy another Toyota again.","96":"Bought brand-new 2016 Toyota Tacoma Limited four-wheel-drive. Most expensive Tacoma truck I found on Short. Just drive around the dealership area and felt fine. Few days later at speeds greater than 60 mph the steering wheel had a vibration and I felt like the truck had a shimmy brought to local dealer in Clearwater, Florida. They diagnosed, re-balance the tires. Called Toyota and ordered three new tires. It was better but was not fixed. Would not extend loaner car while they continue to diagnose. Set an appointment for when wife was out of town so I could use her Mercedes, since Toyota did not offer a loaner car.Granted I did not buy this truck from this dealer, however, Toyota should've stepped to the plate","97":"shifts early, no power shifting to 2nd. sporadic.shiftingThis appears to be a known issue with the 2016 Toyota Tacoma. Why Toyota won't initiate a recall is beyond me, unless the cost is such that they choose to manage it on a case by case basis. From what I'm told the 2016 has a new engine in it, and it is not playing nice with the transmission. The vehicle is a bit jerky and seems to shift early, yielding a feeling of power loss and transmission misbehavior. It's hard to tell if it's an engine issue, a transmission issue, or if the new engine and existing transmission are not working well together. Either way it is extremely disappointing. Up until now I've had a T-100 for the last 16 years and, even with it's minor door, window and seat-belt issues, the engine has always ran very smooth. I wanted a new Tacoma to (hopefully) replace my T-100, and yield a similar history of longevity and durability. But the 2016 has a bad issue right out of the shute, and I see no evidence of Toyota owning up, taking accountability, and offering all 2016 Tacoma owners a fair and equitable resolution. I'm taking mine into the dealership tomorrow, again.","98":"When driving on the Interstate with the cruise control on and going up a hill it would downshift to get up the hill. But once on a level road or going downhill. It would not up shift, unless the cruise control was shut off","99":"Mt truck was not even a month old and the AC popped and stopped working for no reason. The fact that the AC didn't work was not the real issue, when you buy a brand new ( new model) truck, you do not expect these problems. I took it in to my Toyota Dealer and everyone was cool and helpful, but no one seemed to really feel my pain. I was driving around a little two year old and his mom , and there were some uncomfortable moments. I asked Toyota Headquarters for a rental truck with a working AC. They said they could not do so, since it was not a safety issue. Some days and nights were really hot and muggy. Driving on the freeways with the windows open is not ideal. Anyway, they said they needed to get parts , so I picked up the truck the next day and they said they would call me when the parts came in. One week went by, then 3-4 weeks, by the time they got the parts, 3 months went by !! I took the truck in and they took care of it right away and the AC seems fine, since. I cannot believe it took that long to get a 'Special O-Ring'...? 3 months without AC is not good. But, in all fairness, the representative at Toyota Headquarters was really helpful , caring and seemed to have done all he could to help me get things taken care of. He called me regularly and kept me updated on the parts ETA. I had a 2009 Tacoma prior to this one , which I purchased brand new also. I did not have any questionable issues with that truck... I loved it !!. Kinda sorry I traded it in. I think the biggest issue , is that I have lost a lot of confidence in my new truck.... I keep wondering, what else is going to go wrong... sure enough, I now have other issues. ( see other complaints....Wind noise and Suspension noise ...)","100":"tranny feeling sluggish. i had a 2011 Tacoma that was my first Toyota Truck and it a really nice truck i really enjoyed it ,but when i saw the new 2016 Toyota Tacoma coming out i decide to trade mine for the new model because they did a really good change to it. but now after a year having problems with my new 2016 Tacoma trd i really wish i never trade my old model truck for this P. O.Sh*t,and the problem is that TOYOTA CORPORATION doesnt even know what to do to fix the problem ,this truck feels like it lost complete the power and they said this normal ,so if this is normal then this truck is garbage ,i im sorry for my opinion but all im saying is the true and how i feel thank you and i hope they fix this problem","101":"Noise coming from the Rear diff under light throttle around 50-55MPH.","102":"I have owned several Tacoma over the years and have enjoyed owning then but this new one is a different story.","103":"This howling noise from rear end  started at about 6,000 to 7,000 miles on the truck. It has progressively gotten worse. I took the dealer Service Manager for a ride in my truck. He heard the noise right away. It happens at highway speeds of 55 to 65mph most often and it is when the transmission is under light load or no load (feathering the throttle) once you apply throttle the sound goes away. Dealer looked into the issue and contacted toyota corporate. They do not know what the issue is but they went ahead and ordered an entire new rear differential assembly. I find this to be problematic because without a satisfactory root cause analysis, they may or may not be resolving the root cause and the new components may be at risk of failing again.","104":"First I had the no up shifting with cruise control on. They did a software update which solved the no up shift problem. But now it has a intermittent trailer hitching when coming to a stop. Sometimes it even makes a loud clunk noise when doing it.","105":"When going 1 to 5 mph, the truck constantly lunges and revs a bit although I'm not touching my gas pedal. Extremely annoying and somewhat dangerous when trying to pull in and out of tight places \/ my garage, or backing up to something slowly. I have to keep on the brake because it will just try and lunge at anytime.","106":"Vehicle would lurch when shifting from park into reverse or drive. Toyota dealer applied a TSB which updated the ECU firmware correcting this problem. This was a safety issue.","107":"the vehicle will lunge forward when engaing the gearThe vehicle's engine rpm will advance up and down either when moving forward or in reverse while parking. Therefore, this only occurs during very low speeds (1 to 5 mph) This occurs regardless whether the engine is warm or hot and after placing the automatic transmission in gear. You can hear the clicking of some type of relay in the engine compartment when this occurs. I advise the technician of this problem during the 5000 mile servicing. They could not duplicate the problem, however I believe they are aware of the problem and do not have a fix.","108":"My truck always shifts too soon. After each shift engine skipping, unless I stick my foot in it !","109":"Since I bought the truck new, it was very sluggish especially on interstate or on highway with any hills. I know it is a 4 cylinder but the lack of power is unreal. I talked to dealership several times and they said that nothing is wrong. I have changed to high flow air filter and changed exhaust to a better flowing but enough back pressure. I am willing to try anything from removing secondary air filter, deck plate mod and any reprogramming necessary.","110":"Both drivers and passenger window rattle when open up to 3 inches. I've been to the dealer 4 times to have the issue fixed. Everytime I get the explaination that the windows are \"operating as designed\". I guess there must have been a meeting at Toyota to discuess the perfect volume at which windows should rattle...","111":"I took the vehicle to the dealer but with no luck, when you drive about 5 mph the transmission shifts from first to second gear causing a noise as to have too much force, it may be some kind of programming deficiency, if you step on the gas and keep driving normally sometimes shifts normal other times it has a weak shift, I have never experienced that kind of problem in any car, hope that Toyota comes with a fix or I will get rid of the Tacoma and get me something else but not Toyota. Is a shame because that is the only thing that I have found wrong with the vehicle.Update from Apr 25, 2017:The transmission was replaced for a new one including transfer case and torque converter, problem solve at 2,400 miles. Now my Tacoma is a keeper.","112":"transmission dose not seem to be in sink with the engineWhen Toyota redesigned the new engine, I think it caused a problem using the previous Transmission. Maybe the software was not updated to match the new engine!","113":"Just put 10,000 miles on the truck and a whole plethora of problems started to occur. First the air bag light went on. Day 2 the engine light came on as well as the traction control light. Day 3 the cruise control completely gives out and will not even turn on. Day 3 the truck also would not shift for a long time. Got up to around 5000RPM and when it shifted the whole truck would rock. Once in second gear it would do a double shift one right after the other totally bypassing the 3rd gear. I informed the dealership everyday something happened until I could not take it anymore and ended up dropping it off.","114":"After getting the ECU update for the 2016 Tacoma erratic shifting issue, it started failing under hard throttle from a dead stop. The RPM's go from about 800 to 2100, then back to 800, then it will fully accelerate. This happens under mid throttle\/hard acceleration. Feels like a failed torque converter. It is going to the dealer today. I will update...","115":"TRANSMISSION performance is terrible. It surges, jolts and lags constantly. The ECT PWR button helped, but not much. Took it back to the dealer. They did an ECU upgrade. It feels better, but it is still not right. having hesitation when accelerating now. Going back to the dealer today. Will update.","116":"I am very disappointed this vehicle every time I go to shift initially after the vehicle or sit for a period of time has a very hard engagement in the first gear. Has anyone else had this complaint with the vehicle?","117":"transmission slip, erratic shifting,sluggishFirst I would like to say I love everything about the truck accept the transmission. That being said this transmission is terrible. It has very bad shift points and they are never the same. My transmission started slipping until it warms up now that the cold weather is here. My truck has been in and has had a reflash to the ecm. It had an orbital issue where it lost all control and went into neutral coming down a hill into a left turn when I gave it gas, the rpms shot up and it took 1 minute to reset and act like it was in drive again, terrifying. I had the dealer here this morning to see the slip and he said its possibly the fluid level. I have 3 videos of it happing that I cant seem to load here.","118":"Toyota dealer applied a TSB which updated the ECM firmware for better shifting. While the shifting did improve, there are still occasional hard shifts from the transmission for which Toyota offers no solution.","119":"This is by far one of the worst transmissions I've ever had in any car I've owned. I have rough\/harsh down shifts especially when cold. The truck will lurch into gear at low speeds or while parking. The transmission is very slow to downshift making it very difficult to drive in stop and go traffic. The best word I can think of to describe this transmission is: inconsistent. After I've had the TSB done, I still have RPM flares while trying to pass cars on the highway. While the engine RPM's are still high from the flare, if you press the gass, the engine will rev but the vehicle will accelerate.","120":"New 2016 Toyota Tacoma Off road- Transmission suffers from hard shifting, hunting for gears. Toyota came out with a TSB that supposedly fixed affected vehicles, I had the TSB performed (an ECU reflash) at 4,500 miles. Initially the shifting got better, however after 500 miles the vehicle is reverting back to the constant upshifting especially in cruise control.","121":"Drove the truck from Ct to NC in Feb of 2016 when it only had 1k miles on it. When the truck got above 75mph there was a terrible shrieking noise from the wind buffeting against the outside mirrors. What the hell happened to Toyota products?????","122":"I bought a Toyota Tacoma because their ratings were good and complaints low in 2015, 2014 etc... vehicles I did my homework. I bought the car on 3\/14\/16, I complained 3\/21\/16 they said it was fine, I had it in for first tune-up 6\/13\/16 they said everything checked out fine at 5,222 check up, 8\/18\/16 brought it in again on 8\/12 not happy told them it vibrates when braking and also transmission slips. They said they test drove and is \"as designed\" and that they reprogrammed the ECU and reset memory and said all fine. On 8\/17\/16 I brought in again told them it is STILL BOGGING, NOW I'm really upset. The vehicle pulls when braking and still has has issue with transmission. They said I needed to meet with Toyota representative on 8\/26 with S. Carlson. 8\/26, met and still not happy still and issue still not okay they said they thought it was the \"torque\" converter assy so they replaced it under warranty. I went and test drove the same vehicle in Venice fl on 9\/10\/16 at 900 US Hwy 41 Venice, FL 34285. The brakes on it did not grab the slipping (shifting) of transmission did it as well on this vehicle. The Sales guy Eric Digruttolo said nothing wrong with it, then said new technology with direct injection and computer for fuel> what??? how can you say nothing wrong with it if new technology? I did not spend $30k on a vehicle to keep running back to the dealership be given a rental and worry about the longevity on my vehicle. I WANT SOMETHING DONE!","123":"This Pick- Up shifts too soon to the higher gears making it feel under powered and sometimes it seems like it will just die on hills. Toyota says it is \"normal for this type of vehicle\". Well, neither of the Chevy Colorado nor Canyon have this issues.People at popular forums stated that they activate the ECT mode, but then it takes to long to shift and at these higher RPM's the trucks sounds like a sewing machine on steroids...it's just too loud and inefficient. I mean we have to deal with workarounds on a new truck ?Haven't hit the 10k miles yet, and I'm seriously considering to change it for the Colorado. Toyota still haven't come up clean with a solution nor answer regarding this matter other than the \"this is normal for this vehicle\".This is not acceptable. Not for a $34k \"new\" truck.","124":"TRUCK LURCHES AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, SEEMS LIKE IT'S SKIPPING GEARS. TOOK IT TO TOYOTA, THEY SAID THEY'RE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, IT'S A SOFTWARE ISSUE AND THEY ARE WORKING ON A FIX.","125":"I am very disappointed with my new 2016 Toyota Tacoma. I waiting a long time for this vehicle to come on the market. The transmission will hesitate when shifting from reverse into drive. It is also very sluggish when shifting into gear on the highway from speeds 25 through 45 miles an hour. Not sure what the power train warranty is on this vehicle but I did purchase the extended warranty on the vehicle. I am sure it's only 3 year 36 thousand miles. But not sure. Not sure if I am going to keep the vehicle much longer. Too bad, I like every thing else about the truck. Very disappointed with Toyota. First and last one I will own.","126":"Twice it has hesitated going from R to D then catches. When I'm parking in the garage it wants to lurch\/surge occasionally. I'm modulating the brake because the truck just fits inside. (Trying not to go through the wall.)  The transmission feels indecisive and hesitant. It is very annoying when you take off from a stop then have to let off the gas when traffic slows ahead. When you get back on the gas the truck seems unresponsive for a couple seconds.  It seems the engine spends a lot of time bogged down in low RPM's waiting for the tranny to respond.This trans makes my old Fiesta look like a gem.","127":"Waiting to hear when computer flash will be available. Dealership has been fantastic.","128":"When transmission is cold I back out of the garage put the truck if D and it takes 2 to 3 seconds before it engages into D. No problems when warmed up. Have a Toyota care appointment in June will talk to them about it. I had 4 Toyota Trucks before and never had any problem with shifting. I hope they will look into this problem.Update from Apr 18, 2017:took my truck to the toyota dealer on 3-21-2017 explaining my problem with the delayed shifting. I took it in at 9am      and they called me at 1pm said my truck was done. when I picked it up I talked to the mechanic and he said he knew right away what the problem was. They did a TSB which was to update the ECU programming. He said this was a common problem with the 2016 Tacomas.","129":"My truck was parked in my garage and the next morning as usual went to take it out. I pressed the lever to reverse gear and nothing happened when I released brake. Went back to park mode and shifted back to reverse and nothing happened when I released break. reverse gear did not engage. went into drive mode and nothing happened here again. turned ignition off and tried again and nothing happened in reverse again. I have to back my truck from the garage and at this point it was really frustrating and worrisome. I once again went into reverse mode and this time pressed the accelerator a bit more. Truck lurched and engaged into reverse in a hurry. I had to press the brake hard in order to back off slowly since there is not much room in the side of truck with garage. I think it is a very dangerous situation just to press the accelerator so hard just to engage into reverse mode. I could have easily hit the side of garage at that speed if the truck were not perfectly aligned with my garage. Luckily nothing happened. I am really pissed off since it has less than 5000miles. Did not expect this from Toyota.","130":"I have been very disappointed as to the fact that I paid $40,000 for a truck that has a hard shift and erratic shifting patterns. It looks like from what I'm reading this is a common problem with the toilet Tacoma 2016. I am hoping that this will be a recall on the vehicle before the warranty is up and that it is fixed at Toyotas expense and not mine. Please let me know if anyone has been able to have this issue resolve the Toyota how we greatly appreciate it thank you!","131":"When the truck is not fully warmed up yet, when the transmission is up-shifting from 3rd to 4th gear, it flares and the engine revs (about 500 rpm) while it tries to engage in 4th gear. Happens every single morning when I leave the house. Also (related I think) is when I'm on the highway, and I'm either giving it heavy gas to merge or give it gas to downshift, whenever it tries to engage into 4th gear under load, there is a few-second flare\/slip until it finally settles into gear.","132":"Vibration in steering on brand new 2016 Tacoma Limited. Took to dealer service where I bought it in Hickory.Mechanics could not find it. Didn't have time to wait any more after 2 hours. Will take back and show them in a couple weeks, when I have time. Have 495 miles on it now.","133":"I bought a brand new 2016 Tacoma from a dealer at Tomball. I do not like to complain, but I am trying to give them feedback on this new design. Every time, I shift to reverse; it will take some time for the gear to engage..please take a look into this. Thanks","134":"Like so many complaints with 2016 Tacoma Automatic transmission, sluggish and slow engagement of transmission when cold.I think this is a safety problem, I was almost involved in a wreak pulling into traffic and transmission acted like it went into neutral for a few seconds when i let off the gas and got back on it.I am due for a visit to dealer at 10,000 miles, I'll see what they say.","135":"Slight delay when moving from P to R or P to D from a cold start.- Sluggish \"jittery\" acceleration from a stop to highway speeds.- Erratic shift patterns as if shifting to a higher gear on acceleration too soon and then downshifting to make up for the loss in acceleration.","136":"surging when coldWhy the hell does the vehicle lunge either forward or reverse when the engine\/transmission is cold, I'm not talking cold temps, but when the vehicle is first started even in mild mid 60's temps, backing out of my garage I get the lunge, like accelerating on it's own. Frankly I think the transmission sucks, have thought that from day one of ownership, they should have kept it a 5 speed automatic, it shifts far too much, and is very sluggish at low speeds. Again, might just get rid of it. I like the looks of the truck, but the tick tick tick engine and the crappy transmission will have me in another vehicle soon.","137":"I live in Az so this is not just about the transmission not engaging in cold weather as it was 102 here today. The transmission will not engage without a 5 to 10 second delay anytime of the day. When you start the truck and place it in reverse it will hesitate before shifting, if you press the gas before it engages the engine will race and then it will drop into gear and fly backwards. If you place it in drive it will hesitate at least 5 seconds every time before it drops into drive and starts moving forward. This is especially dangerous if you have backed out onto a street as the truck will not move for 5 to 10 seconds.I have taken it to 3 different Toyota dealers in Az and they all say that it is normal, the truck is designed that way. I traded in a 2008 Tacoma on this truck and I wish I had it back, 8 years old and was never in the shop for anything. Love the truck but hate the drivetrain\/transmission, am really disappointed with Toyota over this design.Update from Jun 1, 2016:I backed out of a driveway with a slight up hill grade. When I moved the gear in to drive the transmission would not engage. After waiting for app 1 minute without the transmission engaging I had to place the truck in park then back into drive before it would engage, this is a major safety issue as you can be stranded in traffic until the transmission engages. I took it back to the dealer who again says there is nothing wrong with the truck that is the way it is designed. I no longer have to worry about it though as today I took it to a ford dealer and traded it in on a new F150. A Toyota Tacoma 5 months old, app 4000 miles on it and I lost over $5000 on the deal but at least I don't have Toyota with a bad transmission anymore. I have had several Toyotas and loved them but the 2016 Tacoma is a failure.","138":"Transmission delay in the morning when cold from going from reverse to neutral to drive. Happens consistently. Took in to dealership several times, they could not replicate issue. Several forums on www.tacomaworld.com state this is a low ATF symptom and some users have reported the dealership topping on transmission fluid and it helping the problem. Toyota needs to release a TSB asap.","139":"Transmission is cold. Backing out of driveway, neutral, then into \"Drive\". There will be a brief, 2-second pause, before engagement and the vehicle can be driven forward. No clunks, no noise. It simply acts as if it were in still in neutral. No issues if the transmission has been warmed up.","140":"The steering drifts and is hard to hold the center of road. Highlander 1000% better.

On 11\/24\/15 I got into the vehicle to crank it up when the vehicle's warning lights of brake, ABS warning to check the anti\u017clock brake system and check brake system and the antiskid\/traction lights came on at approximate 110 miles. I immediately called the dealership and was told that it would not hurt the vehicle to drive it and that it was safe. I was told that it was probably just a fuse by a salesperson, who allegedly talked to one of the master technicians about the situation. On 11\/30\/15 I also reported that the cruise control was also not working to the service department when I arrive at the dealership. The vehicle was diagnosed with a bad left rear speed sensor at 185 miles and again that the vehicle was safe to drive. On 12\/04\/15 at 334 miles the sensor was replaced. As I was going home on the interstate highway and less than 10 miles away, the same lights and warning readouts came back on. I immediately turned the vehicle around and proceeded back to the dealership. On my way back to the dealership while slowing down, a loud metallic banging\/rattle could be heard coming from the rear end. When I got back to the dealership, I explained the same symptoms happened again as before and that now clanging\/rattle in the rear end had developed to the service manager. At approximately 4:00P.M., I received a call from the service department and was told that a rear wheel bearing was not installed correctly from the factory, that it had done some damage and that the parts were ordered.

I took the truck back in again (a two hour round trip.) They service manager felt the leaf spring bushings were dirty from the dirt roads and needed pressure washing. They pressure washed the leaf springs but they started squeaking again not 30 minutes later.I understand Toyota Corporate has acknowledged this is an issue on 2016 Tacoma, but they do not yet have a solution. Dealer said there is a recall and they would call me when replacement leaf springs were available since there is a backorder. They did try to pressure wash the leaf springs again, but the leaf springs were already squeaking again by the time I got home.I saw on another complaint for this same issue that Toyota Corporate told the dealers specifically NOT to oil or grease the leaf springs as this will attract more dust and dirt, and make the problem worse.

However, when you have your family in the truck, take that left turn at the light and just as you are halfway to being on that road you notice a vehicle attempting to keep you from turning so they have accelerated to 90 mph to get you to stop or scare you to death because they think the road is theirs and not yours. So you do the only thing left to do since you have too much of the truck on the road you are turning onto, you floor it. Now most people are used to an engine that, when you floor the gas pedal, it firmly plants the back of your head on the headrest you never use except in these moments. Now here is the problem. NOTHING HAPPENS! You are in the hands of a 19 year old idiot who, if they were going much faster than you realized, could plant their hopped up Honda Civic squarely in the seat your wife is in. So the big bad truck you thought you had now turns into a non-factor because it takes too long to accelerate. Once I realized I had a problem with the truck, and the best answer Toyota can give is the fluids need topping off, given their recent record, I traded that truck in so fast I forgot I even bought it. I will NOT lose a family member to a company that has gotten so bad, my wife has to use a rental car because her 2006 Lexus IS250 has a defective passenger air bag, and it is not just their Lexus, it is every Lexus\/Toyota that has that Tecata (spelling?) air bag installed in it. So for the years I had the Lexus, which I thought was the best automobile you could buy, had an air bag that could possibly deploy at any moment and snap your neck or any other passenger, I have now become a Toyota HATER. They have the nads to have poor people who work for food assemble their cars and you unknowingly buy the car and someone could die but it's ok a few people dieing is cheaper than replacing every air bag right Toyota?

I was alerted of a check engine light and took this to the dealer for repairs. I was told that the wiring harness had been chewed by a rodent and this was very common at this dealership. I didn't think anything of it until I went online and notice thousands having the same issue. This is not just a one time thing or a chance occurance. There are several pending class action lawsuits against Toyota for defective wiring and engine components that are made of a soy based product that is a principal source of some rodents diet. This makes the engine components irresistible to rodents. Honda, Toyota and Ford have all been experiencing higher than normal issues with this since switching to this product. What makes this worse is that there is no solution to the problem. I cannot move or relocate because of the wildlife, squirrels are everywhere. Additionally, the dealership snickered with put some moth balls or make some homemade rodent repellant. Unfortunately whatever spray or toxic repellant you use around the engine, will eventually be breathed into the cabin which could become deadly. This also could affect drive that are in motion or could leave them stranded on the side of the road. Luckily for me, my car was parked and I was alerted by the check engine light and able to drive the vehicle to the dealership. Of course the dealership did not cover this on the warranty and Toyota could not be reached for comment directly due to pending litigation.

The vibration is powerful and worst in the 2,100-2,500 RPM range. Extreme cold weather temperatures (15 degrees or less) dampen it. \ud4cdhe vibration only occurs when the engine is under load. It does not happen when the engine is revved through these ranges in park or neutral. \ud4d1hen the vibration occurs in the 2,100-2,500 range, it happens at an intensity and frequency that causes clothes and shoes to vibrate. Moreover, one can feel the vibration in the skin and bones. \ud4d1hen traveling for long distances on the highway through hills or mountains, the engine often settles in the 2,000-2,500 range. The vibration is constantly present in the steering wheel and gas pedal. After long exposures to this vibration via long trips, hands and feet begin to experience tingling. I constantly try to steer with minimal to no contact with the steering wheel and using cruise control to avoid the discomfort. This affects driver's ability to feel and maintain proper control of acceleration and steering. I find myself constantly trying to get out of this range when on long-distance highway travel. I have been working with Toyota since October 2015 to address this issue to no avail. This includes three service department visits and myriad phone calls with Toyota corporate help line.-Littleton, CO, USA","164":"Brought it in for repairs on Monday, 01-30-17, for a repeated problem, since I have had the truck, of a surging problem {engine idling acceleration} that pushes the truck when backing up, or going forward when pulling in or out of the garage, I have also had a problem with the trip odometer and the climate control temperature display resetting on it\u2019s own. I had accelerated to pass a car, and as the transmission shifted to a lower gear it made a loud bang as a hard shift, not soft as it should. As of today 02-04-17 the truck is still in the shop waiting on parts to be shipped from Toyota. They are replacing the Instrument cluster. Said they found a loose ground terminal that should take care of the trip odometer and the climate control temperature display resetting on it\u2019s own.We will see when I get it back.","165":"check engine light, air bag light, traction controlPut 10,000 miles on the truck and all of a sudden a ton of lights started coming on. Dealership tried saying a lot of the sensors had corrosion on them already which is doubtful and I would have believed except the truck stopped shifting. Starting to turn into a huge problem.","166":"All of a sudden the cruise control has stopped. It will come on every once in a while and then all of a sudden it will go off again. Very bothersome especially with a brand new truck.","167":"The rear seats do not lock. For example, the rear seats have a locking mechanism under the seat. When seat is put back into its normal position it does not lock. I had a 2001 and the seat locked once put into its normal sitting position.-Waldorf, MD, USA","168":"Brand new truck, have not even made a payment on it yet and it is re-setting the gas tank to full every time I start it. The fuel needle is not lowering as well. This is coupled with air system re-set every time I get in and turn it on (no prior settings are saved) as well as having a very difficult time getting it started. It won't start probably 80% of the time and just a very loud clicking noise as if it's trying. Then some of the time it chugs and chugs and finally starts reluctantly. Other times it starts like a charm.Taken in to the dealer today, and they assumed battery (said they have had a rash of new Toyota's come in with new\/bad batteries) but they tested it and it is not the battery. They are stumped and are working with Toyota to try and figure it out.Not what a brand new owner wants to hear...I have had Toyota's all my life and their performance and quality have been amazing but we are not off to a good start on this one.","169":"I'm a long-time Toyota fan and multiple vehicle owner. I'm writing because I'm disappointed with the inflated fuel economy that my new 2016 Toyota Tacoma Sport 4x4 is showing on the Eco display. At first I was extremely happy to see that according to the display I was getting 25-26 MPG. EPA ratings are 18\/23. But then I measured it myself. Over the course of 4 tanks my actual was consistently between 20 and 21. This was not measured until about 4,000 miles and approaching 5,000 miles on the vehicle, so it wasn't just a first tank fluke. Having my Toyota reporting MPG that is inflated 20-30% over actual is disconcerting. Integrity, honesty and credible MPG calculations are important to me and what I expect of the Toyota brand quality. I am asking Toyota to please fix this --- for my vehicle -- and make sure that it is true and believable for all Toyota vehicles where it is reported.So far Toyota's response has been frustrating --- I have written emails, followed through on their requests to go in to the local dealer to have it checked out multiple times, and many phone calls.The local dealership's service department looked it over and did a \u2018reset\u2019 of the computer\u2019s mileage tracking and said maybe this would fix it -- and to use it and then check it again. I did this and am experiencing the same issue. It is still not working properly.Results are basically the same as before as I measure the miles per gallon (MPG):\n18.535 gal 391.8 miles, 21.14 MPG\n15.392 gal 320.1 miles, 20.80 MPG\nYet the truck\u2019s Eco display shows a reading for this similar time period of 25.2 MPG.I emailed Toyota and received a generic non-helpful email reply, so I called. Per Toyota's instructions I then went back in to a local dealer again -- this time for them to complete a Fuel Consumption Test they requested. They concluded:\n\u201cVehicle MPG does not drop when vehicle is not moving. Gauge only factors in fuel used while moving not while sitting still.\"The vehicle\u2019s MPG calculation is incorrect and very misleading. \n\u2022 The MPG calculation should be taking the total miles traveled divided by the number of gallons of gas used --- regardless of whether the vehicle is moving or not. \n\u2022 This is a very common standard and general practice calculation known and applied by many, including the car industry the U.S. government and general consumers.\n\u2022 Per the U.S. government\u2019s fueleconomy.gov website (U.S. Dept. of Energy) on the page \u201cHow to calculate Your MPG\u201d:\n \u201cDividing the number of miles driven by the number of gallons it took to fill the tank. The result is the vehicle's MPG for that driving period.\"\n\u2022 My MPG is being inflated by this erroneous MPG calculationThis MPG calculation needs to be fixed on my vehicle, and on all Toyota vehicles where a similar calculation and reporting occurs. Among my concerns are:\n\u2022 That I can no longer use this feature to reliably track my MPG or monitor my vehicle\u2019s condition as I should be able to do\n\u2022 When I bought my vehicle, I selected and paid for many features that I value so that I could benefit from them\n\u2022 This error in the truck\u2019s MPG calculation is deceptive; it misleads me, and likely many others, to think that the Toyota Tacoma product is getting significantly better MPG than it really gets\n\u2022 The value of my vehicle is significantly reduced due to this deceptive and misleading error, and more reduced to the extent that the product brand becomes associated with reduced quality, deception and\/or being misleading\n\u2022 This error takes away from the integrity, honesty and credibility I have come to expect as a fan of Toyota vehiclesToyota - Please fix this problem right away --- for my vehicle -- and make sure that it is true and believable for all Toyota vehicles where it is reported.I am feeling that I need this escalated to get it resolved as so far no one has been able to fix it. I have followed Toyota\u2019s instructions to help you diagnose and fix this error, yet it still persists. I am getting impatient and do not want to be run through any more time-consuming hoops or activities. I am asking Toyota to please let me know the next step to get this resolved right away.","170":"Bought the truck on Saturday 10\/24\/2015 before I left the dealership I mentioned the BSM system wasn't working. Dealership stated I had to be driving 5 MPH in order for the BMS to work. Once I left the dealership I immediately pushed the BSM button and to my surprise (sarcasm) I received a message from the computer system which read. (BSM not available) followed by system failure.I immediately called the dealership and they stated to bring in the truck which I did on Monday 10\/26\/2015. I was told by the dealership Toyota told them not to touch the truck as they were going to send a special tech from Toyota. A brand new truck driven about 15-20 miles as the truck had 72 miles on it when I picked it up. It's now sitting in the dealership lot as I drive a gas guzzling Tundra. Very very dissatisfied with the ordeal as this wasn't the only problem with a new truck. What is going on with quality now a days. The more bells and whistle you have the more chances of having problems very early on.Update from Oct 29, 2015:Dealer fixed BSM system on Toyota's recommendation to replace all the sensors however now the interior dash board lights including the radio controls, and climate controls are flickering on and off from bright to dim","171":"THE ENTUNE SYSTEM RADIO WITH A USB FLASH DRIVE USED FOR MUSIC INSERTED YOU CAN NOT USE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO SCROLL THROUGH ALBUMS.

Nothing hit the windshield. When I tried to get the half inch crack repaired, the crack spread to over 18 inches.-Jefferson, NC, USA","174":"On 11\/23\/15 I was able to take possession of the vehicle. On 11\/24\/15 I got into the vehicle to crank it up when the vehicle's warning lights of brake, ABS warning to check the anti\u017clock brake system and check brake system and the antiskid\/traction lights came on at approximate 110 miles. I immediately called the dealership and was told that it would not hurt the vehicle to drive it and that it was safe. I was told that it was probably just a fuse by a salesperson, who allegedly talked to one of the master technicians about the situation. On 11\/30\/15 I also reported that the cruise control was also not working to the service department when I arrive at the dealership. The vehicle was diagnosed with a bad left rear speed sensor at 185 miles and again that the vehicle was safe to drive. On 12\/04\/15 at 334 miles the sensor was replaced. As I was going home on the interstate highway and less than 10 miles away, the same lights and warning readouts came back on. I immediately turned the vehicle around and proceeded back to the dealership. On my way back to the dealership while slowing down, a loud metallic banging\/rattle could be heard coming from the rear end. When I got back to the dealership, I explained the same symptoms happened again as before and that now clanging\/rattle in the rear end had developed to the service manager. At approximately 4:00P.M., I received a call from the service department and was told that a rear wheel bearing was not installed correctly from the factory, that it had done some damage and that the parts were ordered. I expressed my concerns about possible other damage such as the brakes, tire, sensors or the rear housing and safety of the vehicle.-Wytheville, VA, USA","175":"Toyota is reportedly using a new windshield for the 2016 Tacoma line, asserting better acoustical insulating qualities. A long crack across the windshield quickly developed within hours after parking the truck in the parking lot of my employer, and has continued to branch off in several directions since appearing, thus compromising the windshield's structural integrity and safe visibility in bright sunlight. There are no chips, web cracks or evidence of any impacts such as those obtained from stray highway rocks or debris (crack begins at the base of the glass, close the center). Upon receiving a quote for replacement at a nearby repair shop, I noticed another 2016 Tacoma that was reportedly in queue for the same repair. I have since discovered that an alarming amount of new owners of the 2016 model of Tacoma have been experiencing the same issue with cracks that seemingly develop \"on their own\", leading me to believe that there possibly might be issues related to the quality, design, or manufacture\/installation of the windshields. I am hesitant to replace the glass with a matching oem unit.-Splendora, TX, USA","176":"Windshield cracked 2 weeks after purchasing the truck.

I have also found that many other 2016 Tacoma owners are experiencing the same issue.-Powhatan, VA, USA","179":"The windshield cracked after the first pebble hit it on the interstate. I was in a construction zone doing about 50 mph. While this sounds like a normal issue, this happened 200 miles after getting the vehicle. I traded in my 2009 Tacoma which had been hit hundreds of times on this same stretch of road. I didn't think too much of it until I went to the auto glass repair place and discovered mine was the 3rd 2016 Tacoma that week for the same issue. Further research revealed that the 2016 went to a new multi-layered glass that cuts down on noise. I think this contributed to the windshield damage. While a minor chip may have been the result if it had happened with an older version windshield.-Tucker, GA, USA","180":"While parked at my Church, and in the time it took to complete the sermon my tail gate on my two month old truck got stolen.

I go and file a police report in case Toyota asks fro it when I go tot he dealer to ask why the lack of coverage. In researching the net I found out this tail gate theft was high customer complaint item on previous models. To the point the head design Engineer for Toyota promised this would be solved for MY16. It was fro the US, fro Latin America Toyota decided to only equip its top of the line limited edition model with the lock. This really got me steamed. The Dealer stood by what the insurance company said, and so did Toyota Financial services. News Flash, a Tailgate is an Accessory item. So Toyota is creating a thriving market fro thieves and robbers, a black market for stolen Tailgates that will make my truck forever a target. They did not mention a work of warning, that this is a known issue. They actually offered me an accessory lock right after they quoted me a new Tail gate for close to 2 grand.

This typically occurs on drives over 2-3 hours or heavy stop-go traffic. The driver cannot change gears without excessive force on the shifter, resulting in significant changes in driving dynamics while this is occurring (e.g., loss of vehicle speed, loss of engine revs, lugging transmission). Examples include downshifts from 5-6, 5-4, 4-3, and 3-2 as well as upshifts through those same gears. This presents a critical safety concern when the transmission malfunctions and the vehicle does not operate as intended. It places the driver in dangerous and potentially life threatening situations, whereby the driver is taking attention away from driving in order to apply significant pressure on the shift lever in order to get the transmission unstuck. Moreover, while maneuvering the vehicle through traffic or intersections, the driver and others on the road become vulnerable to major accidents caused by a malfunctioning Toyota transmission and the inability of the driver to safely operate the vehicle. I have contacted Toyota on several occasions. Toyota relied on an independent third party dealer to perform an inadequate inspection of a malfunctioning transmission and then proceeded to deny all responsibility; even going as far as to make the assertion that \"the customer can drive the vehicle as necessary\".

The noise occurs between 60-80 mph. It seems like it occurs when the vehicle has a mild wave like ride. It sounds like the drivers side tire is rubbing against the fender well, or the drive shaft may be rubbing against the under carriage. The sound goes away when I slow down.

What I have observed is that the vehicle is too eager to upshift and sometimes goes into 5th or 6th gear and drops the engine below 1000 RPM. It stays in that gear when slowing down and when accelerated it stays in the high gear on bogs down and on two occasions stalled. This is dangerous especially in highway traffic and is especially dangerous when accelerating to pass or accelerating on an highway onramp to merge with traffic. I have take the truck to dealer at around 2000 miles. Was told that they couldn't find any problems and they \"reset\" the transmission. It ran fine for one day and began the problems again. I have operated the truck now to 6000 miles to see if the transmission can \"learn\" its way out of this and it has not. I am going to dealer again and if they tell me again that there is no problem, I am going to force the service manager to drive with me for a day to experience the problem.-Denver, CO, USA","269":"On numerous occasions while entering\/exiting vehicle my knee lightly brushes the 4 wheel drive engage switch located on the dashboard. This activates the 4 wheel drive on the vehicle. This is happening without my knowledge. Since there is no obvious indicator on the dash the the vehicle is in 4 wheel drive, if I do not notice the brief \"engaging 4 wheel drive message\" there is no way of knowing that it is in 4 wheel drive until the vehicle starts \"hopping\" on dry pavement while turning. Should this happen at highway speed on a curve there is the strong risk on a rollover. I have found myself having to regularly check the knob in order to determine if the 4 wheel drive is inadvertently engaged by this light brushing of the knob.-Rosalie, NE, USA","270":"\"the transmission does not downshift from a high gear (5 or 6) to a lower gear when slowing down from 45 mph to 20 mph (or lower). When the accelerator is depressed to accelerate the engine bucks, vibrates, and does not accelerate. The engine RPM drops to 1,000 RPM or lower. If the accelerator is quickly floored the transmission downshifts several gears lower and jerks forward. This condition happens primarily on secondary roads while driving along the road and when pulling from one road into traffic on another road. The situation when pulling into traffic is dangerous because the truck does not accelerate as it should. This truck was purchased new and has 1200 miles on it. This condition has been present since the truck was purchased and the severity varies with truck speed and road inclination. I reported the situation to the dealer and they attempted a fix (had the truck for three days) that supposedly involved a \"new download\" from Chevrolet, but it didn't change a thing. Dealer knows it didn't fix anything and says Chevrolet may have a \"recall update\", but reading all the other similar complaints, I'm suspicious. In the 1 month I have had the truck, I have almost been hit twice by approaching traffic because of hesitant acceleration. This is a dangerous problem and Chevrolet need to fix it immediately. I-Long Beach, CA, USA","271":"I live in a rural area with moderate hills and many winding roads and tree obscured corners. While driving at a moderate speed (30-40 mph), I experience problems with the vehicle's ability to downshift from overdrive to address the increasing incline. The vehicle will, despite normal increase in fuel pedal pressure, lose RPM's from approximately 2,000 to 1,000. As it approaches 1,000 RPM, the vehicle begins to \"stutter\" and \"lurch\" as the engine tries to cope with the higher gear. There are two \"fixes\" for this; pushing the gas pedal down firmly, which causes the vehicle to radically down shift and \"leap\" forward, or to drop the transmission lever to \"manual\" and manually change gears (without the \"leap\" seen in the first method). The end result of the non-manual approach is to cause the vehicle to accelerate radically in an environment of obscured corners and uphill driving. I believe this is a dangerous safety problem as the area is swarming with deer, bicyclists, pedestrians, etc. I have also had \"stuttering\" incidents when accelerating from low speed, to enter traffic, interstate, etc., although these have been intermittent in nature. I have noticed that the vehicle will also radically downshift going downhill without warning and seems to take a long time to up shift once it is on level ground - again an intermittent action. Fortunately no one has been \"tailgating\" me when this occurs (a common failing of drivers in this area). I have had the vehicle to the dealer twice for the failure to downshift for a hill and they tell me Chevrolet does not recognize a problem with the transmission, shifting, etc. A side note: This problem does not exist in cruise control, but use of cruise control on these back roads would not be advisable.-Warrens, WI, USA","272":"Chevy said there are no fixes for the following complaints. Transmission is acceptable and smooth shifting under light loads. Under a need for downshifting for acceleration the down shifting is delayed or hesitates momentarily and then the truck jerks forward to a excessively lower gear & the upshifts to the gear it should have in the first place. The delay or lag in downshifting creates a very dangerous condition when needing instant power. There is much difficulty when merging into traffic when power is needed.. manipulating the manual shift can cover up this defect on some occasions when if you have time to plan for it. The transmission also shutters at low load many times resulting in no power until you downshift. Then this downshift is delayed and then becomes abrupt again. The shutter feels like the truck is going over small bumps in the road. The transmission shifting is certainly not correct and certainly results in unsafe situations. I should have test driven the truck under more conditions than I did and probably would not have purchased it. I hear that this problem can be fixed with an aftermarket computer update. Chevy probably dose not want to admit that in order to have the gas mileage ratings the transmission must bet this way. Also note that the 2017 Colorado will have an 8 speed transmission.-Deer Park, NY, USA","273":"Delayed or no downshift. Traveling about 2 mph and turning either right or left and applying throttle the truck does not respond until the throttle is increased steeply. The transmission does then shift to a much lower gear and acceleration is dramatic.-Camp Verde, AZ, USA","274":"2,400 miles and this vehicle has been back to the dealer four times for \"chugging and shuttering\" in heavy traffic. Driving though an intersection with heavy traffic it will not keep up with traffic but tends to bog down almost getting rear ended from behind. If you try to smoothly accelerate it will rapidly downshift and jump forward almost rear ending any vehicle in front. Very unsafe to drive. Trying to drive with the flow of traffic at 35-40 mph the truck shutters as if the spark plugs are worn out. Also trying to accelerate into on coming traffic it will sometimes chug to where you wonder if it's going make make the merge. Very frustrating to drive for a brand new truck, the dealer replaced the torque converter at 500 miles, then has preformed service bulletin #pip5342B three times with absolutely no improvement. GM states in the bulletin \"note: Preforming this calibration update may not totally address the shudder or chugging concerns\" how can new vehicles continue to be sold with this known problem? not only is it frustrating trying to drive smoothly, but it is also a safety concern. Due to the poor performance the mileage is about 13 mpg in city traffic, not even close to the mileage rating of 17 mpg.-Cape Coral, FL, USA","275":"While driving on a hilly highway at 55 mph, the truck suddenly lurched into an extreme downshift as I was going downhill. I had not been making any significant braking or acceleration motions--just driving normally with the flow of traffic and I had nothing in tow. The truck decelerated quickly and the rpms climbed significantly. This occurred twice: Once around 2,800 miles and a second time at 3,400 miles, under the same conditions - dry roads, daytime, going downhill on a highway. There were not any warnings, and none of the service lights came on. It would not shift out of this gear. Each time, I had to avoid being hit from behind, and pulled over to the side of the road to stop completely. Then I was able to proceed with normal functioning of the transmission. The cause is unknown.-Norristown, PA, USA","276":"While driving the 2016 Colorado, the transmission\/engine seems to have trouble shifting and accelerating and the shift patterns are erratic it seems, maybe its the fuel efficient crap that shuts down cylinders, maybe its the trans?. experienced it on highways and lower speeds, stop and go traffic, truck's transmission clunks, shifts hard at random and stutters allot. It's aggrivating. When trying to pass, seems to be zero acceleration felt when flooring it then suddenly kicks in (roughly)..like oh hey-I need to go.. I could get in a wreck-ended because of this and I better not try to pass anyone.. I feel my safety could be at risk with as much hesitation then suddenly lurches as it has.

He also told me to just floor the accelerator to get power when I need it. It still hesitates even when I floor it and how does that help fuel efficiency? he said if a technical service bulletin comes out on this issue that I can bring in my truck and they will fix the issue. I am scared to pass a vehicle unless absolutely nothing is coming for fear of the time it takes for the truck to find the correct gear. It also kind of jerks when it does find the right gear. This has been going on since I purchased it in January of 2016.-Bay St. Louis, MS, USA","280":"On 6\/6\/16 I started having the trouble. After backing up and putting the truck in gear, the truck would surge forward without touching the gas pedal. This also occurred on 6\/11\/16, 6\/17\/16 and 6\/23\/16. On 6\/23\/16 I was at surdykes port 20 marina at the lake of the ozarks. After backing out of the parking space I put it in gear. This time it was much more than a surge. It literally shot forward and even the brakes didn't help because within 3-4 seconds my truck and I were in the lake. Finally got the window to break so I could escape. Just before I went in the lake the truck struck an old golf cart and jet ski trailer that were parked there and took them into the lake also.-Crystal City, MO, USA","281":"While driving the Colorado, the transmission gets so confused on what gear to be in and the shift patterns are the craziest I have ever experienced. From 40-20mph, stop and go traffic, this truck's transmission clunks, shifts hard, stutters and cannot figure out which gear to be in. It's very frustrating. Not to mention, when trying to pass, there is zero acceleration felt when flooring the peddle. I am so frustrated with this transmission and many days during the to and from work commute, I feel as if I am going to get rear-ended because of this transmission.

I cleared the warning messages and started to drive to take it in and get it looked at by a certified Chevrolet mechanic. I left the parking lot and after entering the nearby street I noticed that the driver information center was not displaying any vehicle information (showing zeros or blanks for all diagnostic information including mileage, fuel, oil pressure, speed etc). Also, the needles for the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and engine coolant temperature gauge were lifeless and reading zeros. Only the odometer and \"infotainment\" system were working correctly. I estimated my speed to be above 30 mph at this point. I immediately pulled off the road, put the vehicle in park and turned it off. I waited a few minutes and scanned the wiring under the hood and steering wheel but could not identify any issues.

In very heavy traffic, present when entering or leaving large cities, the onset and continuance of this vehicle's performance worsens resulting in driver fatigue and extreme stress, brought on by the ever present necessity to be extra watchful and to maneuver to avoid hitting the vehicle in front, or being rear-ended. When driving through mountainous terrain at today's interstate speeds, there is recurring \"bumping\" that sets up when ascending long grades. It creates the feeling that either the transmission is attempting to downshift but then changes its mind, or the engine's RPM are about to increase but don't. this adds to fear of imminent failure and being left stranded. This behavior was present from the very first time the vehicle was driven. It's getting worse.this driver believes the unsafe operating performance of this vehicle as described above, is exacerbated by the combination of the small, 4 cylinder engine coupled to the 6 speed transmission, that requires the engine to rapidly downshift or upshift to provide the needed performance required in today's driving environments.

I can turn AUTO mode off by hitting the vent buttons, but cannot turn AUTO mode back on with any button so that makes me think this is a software bug. However, I don't believe that this AUTO condition is related to the AC problem since I've seen AC come on either way.\nIn short, AC should never come on in the model I have unless I specifically turn it on with the AC button.

The airbag, tcs, and one other lights were illuminated. I turned the vehicle off. Waited a few seconds and turned it back on. The same thing happened again. I cleared the warning messages and started to drive to take it in and get it looked at by a certified Chevrolet mechanic. I left the parking lot and after entering the nearby street I noticed that the driver information center was not displaying any vehicle information (showing zeros or blanks for all diagnostic information including mileage, fuel, oil pressure, speed etc). Also, the needles for the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and engine coolant temperature gauge were lifeless and reading zeros. Only the odometer and \"infotainment\" system were working correctly. I estimated my speed to be above 30 mph at this point. I immediately pulled off the road, put the vehicle in park and turned it off. I waited a few minutes and scanned the wiring under the hood and steering wheel but could not identify any issues. When I started the vehicle again, all the issues were gone as if nothing happened. Seemed kinda like restarting a computer to clear software issues. Not sure what could've caused it. My vehicle is a 2016 Chevrolet Colorado Z71 with 27,000 miles on it. It was purchased October 2015. Probably either a software\/electrical issue, gremlins, or a russian hacking attempt. Due to bribing the gremlins with socks to bother someone else's car, and the lack of any pictures appearing in the infotainment system featuring a shirtless russian dictator making impolite gestures while riding a bear...my uneducated guess is that it's a software issue.-Spotsylvania, VA, USA","315":"The contact owns a 2016 Chevrolet Colorado. The contact stated that while driving approximately 70 mph, a loud popping noise came from the engine area before the speed suddenly decreased to 40 mph.

Driving though an intersection with heavy traffic it will not keep up with traffic but tends to bog down almost getting rear ended from behind. If you try to smoothly accelerate it will rapidly downshift and jump forward almost rear ending any vehicle in front. Very unsafe to drive. Trying to drive with the flow of traffic at 35-40 mph the truck shutters as if the spark plugs are worn out. Also trying to accelerate into on coming traffic it will sometimes chug to where you wonder if it's going make make the merge. Very frustrating to drive for a brand new truck, the dealer replaced the torque converter at 500 miles, then has preformed service bulletin #pip5342B three times with absolutely no improvement. GM states in the bulletin \"note: Preforming this calibration update may not totally address the shudder or chugging concerns\" how can new vehicles continue to be sold with this known problem? not only is it frustrating trying to drive smoothly, but it is also a safety concern.

If the accelerator is quickly floored the transmission downshifts several gears lower and jerks forward. This condition happens primarily on secondary roads while driving along the road and when pulling from one road into traffic on another road. The situation when pulling into traffic is dangerous because the truck does not accelerate as it should. This truck was purchased new and has 1,500 miles on it.

Engine \"stumbled\" as if in a dead spot. Truck did not accelerate and appeared to be lugging badly. Transmission was in too high a gear and seemed to be searching for correct gear. During this time oncoming traffic was forced to brake and there was a near miss of having a rear-end collision. All I could do was watch in the rear view mirror as traffic converged on me. This \"dead throttle \/ wrong gear\" issue has happened repeatedly on surface streets but luckily on surface streets I was not in such a critical situation. This is a problem that has been reported repeatedly and at many places on the internet.

Anybody got anything on this issue, other than you should not have bought a chevy?","329":"They should really fix this issue. The car is giving a coughing sensation and then stalls. That should not happen in a brand new car, either fix it or give me a new one.","330":"I've had this 2016 Colorado since September 2015 so roughly a year and a quarter. This is the third time my truck stalled in the last 2 months. Each time it has stalled, it's been within a few minutes of my house. I'll be sitting at a stoplight and my truck starts shaking and attempts to stall. Truly, I think my truck has tried to do this 4-5 times, but I've been able to stop it a few times now. I started realizing if I let off the brake and let my truck get a little gas (just by letting off the brake) then it stops it from shaking and eventually shutting off. In my years, I've had an Audi A4 (1999) and a Subaru Outback (2001). The Audi never stalled, but the Outback stalled occasionally before selling it. With a truck being only a year+ old, I'm really nervous. They never could figure out what was wrong with the Subaru (because like this there is no error code) and I really enjoy this truck.... WAY disappointing.","331":"Just to enter this one on top of my other claim, this was the day I took my truck in the first time it was stalling.","332":"engine sometimes stalls on a stop, like at signal, and has stalled on take off making a turn. doing this weekly now.","333":"Driving at about 60 miles a hour and lost all power engine was running but going no were all light were lite on dash like you turn key on before starting thank god no one was coming the other way or the car behind me would have hit me.

She put it in park and it cranked back up and she finished pulling into the driveway. I've been watching the rpm's while she and I were driving today and I noticed at times when slowing down to come to a stop the rpms would drop to almost 400ish at times which is not good. Shouldn't there be a minimum rpm kept while the vehicle is running? Going to call the dealership tomorrow to get there input on this.","335":"engine stalls at slow turn- as from a rolling stop or a dead stop and slow acceleration (Low RPM low mph) dealer can't find problem - 8 times it has died and was almost rear ended. 3 times to dealer no luck, they can not duplicate the problem but say it is safe to drive - don't think so. Unless they can fix it I see some real problems, especially if it results in an accident","336":"I was driving my infant son to day care this morning. Heading down a hill going about 20 mph and coming to a stop sign. I slowed to about 2-3 mph and then tried to roll the stop sign. I noticed the screen had popped up for \"Hill Start Assist\" even though I was still moving. I tried to go again and the the engine had died. Just flat out died, the car \"dinged\" once and I'm not really sure why. Luckily I had a little momentum and had passed the steep part of the hill. Had to pull over at the corner and restart the truck.I took the truck home and hooked up my OBDII reader and got no codes.I had more faith in my 94 Ford Ranger that I got rid of last year than I do in this truck.","337":"After backing up, and putting truck in drive, the truck surged forward without touching the gas. First time was leaving a grocery store. Second time was backing out of parking space at condo. Third time was leaving a business. This was worse than other two times. On 6\/23\/16 I was at a marina at Lake of the Ozark. After backing out of parking space and putting in drive, the truck surged so fast and hard, it threw my head back against head rest. It surged so fast that within three to four seconds it shot off the sea wall and landed in the lake about ten feet from wall.I was drifting away and sinking. Electric windows were dead and too much pressure to open doors. Used a hammer on window until hammer broke. Finally, a bystander jumped in and finally broke the window with a piece of concrete block. The water was up to my waist when I went out the window. I shredded my right leg and was taken to hospital by ambulance for stitches. Thankfully, no one was with me. All four instances happened within a two week period.This was the most terrifying experience of my life. I have heard from friends that their Colorado and GMC Canyon was doing similar things.Surely someone at Chevrolet\/ GMC knows something but aren't talking.","338":"Chevy Colorado 2016 z71 4x4 with dealer installed 5.5 BDS lift kit and 33x 12.5 x 20 wheels with 14610 miles. Truck was sold as a conversion truck. I had complete transmission failure which left me stranded last week. No previous symptoms were noted before this occurred.This is what happened...I was driving normally to a friends house. Within the first mile the truck started to shift weird. I checked my transmission temp and it was getting very hot very quickly from 170 to 300 in minutes. The rpms where high and the speed was slow. I drove it about another mile and parked it. The temperature was marking over 300 degrees F when I stopped. It is under warranty and the dealer will fix it but they don't even know how to open the transmission; they had to order the special part to drop transmission first. The mechanic not knowing what the problem actually is, thinks it my be due to the lift and tires. Others think it could be a stuck valve. I have heard from other people that the dealer no longer offers warranty on colorados after the truck has been lifted and tires altered. I hope this problem does not happen in another 14,000 miles. email me robertbeknown@gmail.com if you are experiencing this issues as well.thanks, BOB","339":"Truck runs perfect the last 9400km. Than the car starts to jerking between 50-60km\/h and 70-90km\/h always in the 5th or 6th gear when accelerating slowly. It starts to downshifting and not shifting since this time and the transmission make a loud noise when shifting. The gas consumption went from 12L to 16L.Went to the dealer and they found nothing. They went with me on a test drive and experience the problem but they said that is normal. It could not be normal because the LAST 9400 km the car runs without any problems and the shifting was good. They also mentioned that it feels that the Torque Converter might have a problem.They said the car learned my driving stile. If this is right, than it should be gone after the reset the transmission software. They did but nothing change still a extreme shaking and jerking and its a pain to drive the car. I also came to a few dangerous situation when the car was not shifting down.I worked over 4 year as a test driver for Mercedes Benz in Germany and this problem is definitely not NORMAL. I will ask my dealer to replace the Torque Converter and than sell the car immediately.","340":"2016 Colorado when going up a small hill at 20mph it shakes like it has no power I've got 3000 miles on it and the dealership says that's normal. Now it does the same thing at 40 to 44 mph.","341":"After truck shifts into 3rd gear and you slow down, it does not down shift properly. You have to give it a lot of gas and then it downshifts into 1st gear causing you to lunge forward. Sometimes it starts jerking before it downshift.","342":"The transmissions on these trucks are programmed very very badly. They shift up really fast and try to hold 6th gear even when they really need to shift down to climb even a slight hill. It feels like a manual transmission in high gear when you floor it and it just shudders. I assume this is just to save on gas but it is absolutely undefined and completely embarsssing when you have passengers and your truck is shaking trying to get up a hill beciase it just won't shift down.I bought the trifecta performance Colorado advantage tune as someone else mentioned it on this site and while it did give the truck wayyyyyy more power and a better throttle response it still had horrible shift points especially when coming out of corners and accelerating. It shifts down too far so when you press the accelerator suddenly you jerk intil it upshifts. Basically just winds out the gears longer and won't shift into 6th until you are at interstate speed. Really just traded one extreme way of shifting for another.I gave up on the truck and I think GM gave up on that transmission as well because now they are putting 8 speeds in the 2017 models. Hopefully they are more refined and better programmed than the 6 speed.I traded the truck for a ram after only a month and half of owning it and took a loss. I have never been a mopar fan but after driving and considering a Silverado the ram was just smooth as silk. This confirms my hesitation to buy a gm vehicle in the first place.","343":"Purchased my 2016 Chevrolet Colorado LT March 5 2016. Drove it home and returned a week later to have dealer put on hitch & wiring for towing my small boat. Picked up truck and everything great. Before getting a chance to tow my boat I stared having problems on the morning of March 18, 2016 with 300 miles on truck. After coming to a stop and then trying to accelerate the transmission violently kicks into gear and takes off. A low clunk is heard.I went straight to dealer and a salesperson drove with me and confirmed the problem. We then drove back to the service dept. and a mechanic test drove the truck and confirmed my complaint but did not have a clue to what was the cause. I left the truck for them to trouble shoot. I called them 4 days later and they told me it was possibly some kind of valve in or attached to the transmission or drive line. They ordered the part and I will update my post once I get the truck back.Update from Mar 30, 2016:Picked up my truck yesterday after it spent 10 days at the dealership.

It has problems with the transmission shifting from day 1. When you are going down a hill it down shifts and throws you forward from how hard it is shifting and has no acceleration after this. This truck was what I really wanted but it is a pain to drive. I will never buy this again and will never refer anyone to buy one of these. I am getting ready to go on vacation and I dread driving this due to the transmission issues.","347":"Bought this 2016 Chevrolet Colorado Z71.....Having exact same problems everyone else seems to be mentioning.....I have taken it to the Dealer twice now....no one seem to know what i was explaining or talking about...they test drove the vehicle......how can you not notice what the truck was doing??? The Problems are very obvious...it's bad I have had to research this on my own...but its also good to know that I am not the only one dealing with all these issues....just looking to see if anyone has a solution to the problems. Very poor acceleration, hesitates like it wants to stall, the shifting is horrible. It shifts hard occasionally. The down shift, the upshift, everything is weird. AGGRAVATED!!!","348":"When navigating a corner transmission looses its gear and acts like it doesn't know what to do and bangs and stalls. Also transmission acts confused in stop and go situations(city) and bangs when it remembers. Also does this when coasting on highway and accelerating again. It may jump down several gears and take off like I smashed the accelerator.","349":"transmission shifts at odd RPM's causing the motor to race or lug depending on how and where your driving. it also seems to drag or labor during traveling. I haven't pulled a trailer yet so I don't know how it will act.Update from Jan 13, 2017:the transmission shift points were set back to factory new specs twice, the problem is still present. the truck will not shift properly.","350":"truck will downshift on release of accelerator, not just to lower gear but a few will push you forward hard and seat belt will tighten. also seems to be searching at times for right gear between 30-40 mph","351":"Transmission doesn't shift properly, takes too long to react to acceleration, then makes up for it by upshifting twice. Takes a long time to upshift after downshifting. For example, I slow down to take a corner, when I have turned and start to push the pedal, the transmission takes too long to react. This is dangerous because sometimes you need to adjust your speed to avoid an accident. Also, it is inconsistent and therefore can be dangerous when you expect the truck to do something, but it does not react the way it has before. Also, when it overcompensates for the time, it creates a 'bang', I can only describe as it would be like someone tapped you on the back bumper while you were driving.","352":"I am adding my weight to this common complaint that I read here, that the 2016 Colorado does not downshift properly when more torque is required like going up (even small) hills. This is been happening also to me pretty much since I bought my pickup in the fall of 2015 but fortunately most of my driving is freeway so I'm not as affected as others are. Plus I'm learning to put the auto transmission more often into manual shift (or driver-assisted shift) mode which is the \"M\" position on the console. This way you have near instant control of the downshifting.Best is to put it in \"M\" when coming out of park or neutral; the problem I've found with switching to \"M\" mode during driving is that, contrary to how I would design it, this immediately causes the transmission to downshift, at least in my experience, and races the engine when you're not ready for it yet. I would prefer that switching to \"M\" keeps it in the same gear but simply enables the mode, and then the driver can use the thumb rocker switch to downshift\/upshift from there.Basically I love the look and features of this pickup and the mileage on freeway but I've identified several things, including this transmission issue plus some accessory nuisances, that to me are all related to faulty programming of the CPU. For instance I'm the guy who's iPod mini got destroyed by the USB port (see other complaint), and my iPod touch is working fine but every now and then the audio system forgets it's plugged in to the USB when starting the engine and I have to unplug and replug it, and this does not always work. My point is this transmission issue could perhaps be fixed with a \"simple\" code upgrade which says to never let the RPM go below 1400 (or whatever) when the gas pedal is engaged. I, like many of you, are bewildered to see our engines lug around 1000 and we're stepping on the gas!Overly simple bottom line: GM could employ some better programmers and beta tester drivers before releasing their software to the factory floor.","353":"I wish I had read about the Colorado transmission problems on this web site before I bought my new truck!! The transmission will not smoothly downshift. I stays in high gear (6th) all the way down to less than 1000 rpm. When you try to accelerate it bucks and almost stalls. If you stomp on the accelerator it downshifts and jerks forward.I called the dealer at about 1,000 miles and told them about it. They said \"it will get better with time\" ---- NOT! I had them check it further at the first service visit and they all was normal -- NOT!! I then called Chevy customer service and they said a fix was being developed and they would confirm my call with an email --- NOT!!Based upon the large number of complaints reported online I certainly hope that Chevy has a fix planned. In the meantime driving this truck is a PITA!Update from May 4, 2016:I filed a formal complaint with the NHTSA and urge everyone else having the same problem to do so.  There dozens of people experiencing the same issue with the 2015 and 2016 Colorado\/Canyon trucks.  This is what I filed with the NHTSA ---  \"The transmission does not downshift from a high gear (5 or 6) to a lower gear when slowing down from 45 mph to 20 mph (or lower).

We call BS as it hadn't started doing it until 4500 miles and the loaner they gave us (Colorado 4cyl) doesn't do it (yet) they said it has a different set up. The dealer is saying there is no fix for it or design issue at this time - If you can drive 60 mph everywhere its great if Not you will Hate this Design Feature!!! We are trying to figure out how to get our money back or wonder if the new Colorado with the 4 cyl turbo diesel would have the same issues? We are hoping Chevrolet comes up with a solution as we really like the truck otherwise - If anyone is considering buying this truck wait till they fix this problem!","355":"After starting my truck and driving until the engine warms up, I turn on just the fan and the A\/C light comes on. According to the manual that is only supposed to happen if the auto defog is activated. It does not turn on when I start the truck if the engine is warm. Also, the radio\/usb port will randomly turn on by itself when I start the truck or sometimes after I end a phone call. Once the entire touch screen system was completely inoperable.

If the accelerator is quickly floored the transmission downshifts several gears lower and jerks forward.

When the light turned green I accelerated to 40 mph over a reasonable distance, approximately a block. I then eased off the gas pedal to maintain the current speed. When I went to accelerate there was nothing, the truck just hesitated. I eased off the gas pedal and applied it again a little further and the truck accelerated.What makes this a pain in the ass is that you shouldn't have to play footsie with the gas pedal to get the truck to go down the street. And it certainly shouldn't be unresponsive when the gas pedal is applied. I'll investigate further to determine if this is an issue with the electronic throttle control. My other thought is that the truck is going thru the gears to fast, and the RPM's get too low.Update from Nov 6, 2016:Recommendation from auto dealer was to turn off traction control system.  Of course you have to do this every time you start the truck.The truck is more responsive now.  Also read in the manual that when using cruise control it will disable TCS as well.

However, it seems that on this rainy morning the GMC Intellink was unable to boot up, leaving the screen blank. This is concerning for 2 reasons; the first is that it makes me feel like whoever developed the firmware made the boot up sequence reliant upon some event (for example, connecting with On-Start), and because of the clouds it couldn't complete the sequence. The other reason this is a concern is that at time of purchase I opted not to get the extended warranty for the screen, so I'm feeling like the later years of ownership with this vehicle is going to cost me a fortune.I still enjoy driving my truck, but when the basic functionality (like the radio) doesn't work, then its a frustration.

The loss of power, lack of acceleration and indecision of the transmission shifting is not only annoying, but is also dangerous. However, GM seems to be sweeping the problems under the table by passing the problem on to the dealers. The dealers are throwing their hands up by declaring there is nothing they can do : that its a GM problem and until GM develops new software to reprogram the ECM there is nothing that they can do.They also say that if there are no trouble codes when they test for them, there is nothing wrong and everything is functioning properly. Unfortunately, with this particular problem, everything is probably functioning properly: just not together. This problem has been in existence since the 2015 models were brought out and so far, they have not fixed it. From what I can tell from other written complaints, everyone is being told the same thing: that everything is operating normally.My dealership (Lee Buick, GMC in Crestview, Florida) has even lied to GM and told them that they drove my Canyon \"several times\" and found no issues. In fact, they drove it one time for about 7 miles (as per the service tech) and determined that it was okay. The problem with this engine\/transmission\/ECM combination has been documented over and over in complaint forums but GM ignores it by saying everything is running according to specs. Maybe it's time for some class action.","385":"This is amazingly bad. It appears all 2015-2016 GMC CANYON and Chevy Colorados with the V6-auto drive train have this problem.

So I pressed a little more and the engine just high revved and still didn't shift. Therefore, I took my foot off the pedal and upon pressing it again it accelerated.I also wanted to note that since this is an ongoing problem I'm not just slamming the gas pedal to the floor, but attempting to feather it to see if that helps the situation.Also, I'm doing more to capture the actual speed so that I can determine if it always occurs at a certain speed. Since what I'm seeing is that the automatic transmission gets to 4th gear as fast as it can, and tends to leave the RPM's really low which introduces problems when trying to accelerate again.Update from Nov 6, 2016:Recommendation from dealer was to turn off TCS.Upon doing so the truck drives much better.","389":"Truck seems to be missing when cruising, then hesitation when accelerating.

After wondering what the issue could be I started researching problem and found out others are having the same issues. Having to deal with the shifting problems really keeps you focused on your driving for sure as you try to make sure you don't bump into someone and someone hopefully doesn't bump into you due to poor hesitation caused by the transmission not functioning properly. I saw were one post stated there was a software update the improved his performance 75% from what issues he was having. I just took my Canyon to the dealership this past weekend 9\/10\/16 for a check on a recall on the trailer hitch and also to check out the transmission issues. Trailer hitch recall was fine but, they test drove the truck 15 miles and came back stating works and fires as designed. I expected this and I told the supervisor I heard there was a software update that could improve the shifting and was told no software update was available. I was very disappointed and I dropped 30K for this truck and my sadness and pains with this performance issue will be felt even more as I have to pay for this bad boy of a truck for several long years.
