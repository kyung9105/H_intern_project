I replaced the blade with a 15 "" blade and all is fine now. Hyundai did nothing for me in fixing the problem except offer to pay for the new blade.

Many of our friends have had knees and hips replaced and are a ""little on the heavy side"" and they like wise have the same needs. With this as a back drop we realized we needed a SUV. Our last car was a 2013 Toyota Avalon a tuff act to follow for the average SUV when it comes to driving dynamics,performance and efficiency. Spent more time researching,driving and comparing vehicles then we ever have in our lives. Looked at SUV's,when comparably equipped to this car cost upwards of $60,000 and kept coming back to the Santa Fe. Wife liked the size of the Lexus RX350 but we both thought the styling was hideous especially the front end and so it went as we one by one eliminated the completion for this vehicle. Yep in the end we just liked this thing the best The fact it was the best bang for the buck was just frosting on the cake. After following the manufactures break in recommendations to the letter made our first trip to see our grand kids. As you can imagine we have made this trip many times. Expected mileage would fall well short of our Avalon but was surprised to see a average of 27.3 MPG going down in windy conditions and 29.5 mpg coming back. Our Avalon averaged around 30-31mpgs. Amazing. Seat comfort was outstanding the seats fit us like a glove. Ride comfort was just the way I like it firm but not harsh and well controlled. Fair share of hills and turns on our route and the handling was very Avalon like once you started to trust it and drive it accordingly. Loading up the Grandkids and the their parents for a short trip got rave reviews and youngest who loved the climate controls in the third row and dug the simulated Surround Sound of the killer 12 speaker ""sound system"". Son in law was amazed how favorably the vehicle compared to their new Acura. Found every feature easy to use and love the old school buttons and knobs verses the latest touch screen menu drive stuff that is the current fad. GPS is a snap to program easier the the Avalon. Almost as good a my Garmin which is still my favorite over all. Hard to fault this car but here goes. The drivers seat has a noticeable ripple in one of the panels in the bottom edge of the seat. Might go away with a little use but if not I will talk to the service manager and Hyundai about it. That's about it for complaints.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 14}",Yep we love this thing!,1490222678953.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'EXCELLENT', 'maintenanceCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'purchaseCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'EXCELLENT'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2017.0,,

We test drove the new Highlander and thought that was hard to see over the dash and the engine lacked power. We investigated the Honda Pilot but it looked huge, was really expensive and the dealer wouldn't budge much from MSRP. The dealer actually bragged about the fact that they sell near MSRP. So we decided to try the Hyundai Santa Fe even though we had never owned one before, based on internet and Consumer Reports reviews. I had previously driven an older Hyundai Santa Fe model as a rental and had liked it. So we picked out the Santa Fe SE with the Premium Package based on features/price and found a local dealer in Massachusetts. They gave us a great quote over the Internet, just a bit over invoice price. You can still figure out dealer invoice prices using a site like MSN Autos. Don't bother using sites like True Car, they basically give dealers a lead on your business and not the best price for you. We did much better looking directly at dealer sites.  The Hyundai dealer was great, very helpful in all aspects of the purchase. All the features we got with the Santa Fe would have easily cost $10K more on the Honda Pilot. We've had the Santa Fe about 3 months now through the NE winter. The AWD is excellent in the snow and the V6 is really powerful on the highway. It cruises at 85 mph easily. We've driven to northern Vermont, and Maine. It has a very comfortable quiet ride. Not sure why other people were complaining about wind noise I haven't heard it. The rear and 3rd row seats split to allow you to put skis in, very useful as you can still get 5 people in the car with skis. Kids in the 3rd row only though. The ride is not super sporty but it has a good road feel. The safety features are excellent. Rear view camera and proximity warning systems on the side mirrors work great. My only minor complaints are that the electronic dash system is a bit complicated, the front seatbelt clips are a bit low and I don't like the feel of the leather steering wheel. Also, you can only listen to the radio about 10 minutes without the engine running, the it shuts off. I think I will get used to all these issues over time. Overall the Santa Fe is an excellent SUV choice, I definitely recommend test driving one.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 12}",After 3 months we really like it,1488304759152.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2017.0,,

Disclaimer - this is a review from a Hyundai owner for Hyundai owners. If you're looking to compare with other similar vehicles, your mileage may vary.

Previously owned - 2002 Mitsubishi Diamante, 2010 Sonata, 2013 Santa Fe Limited.

If you like me have been fascinated by Hyundai's 2013 Santa Fe (long base, not Sport), you like me have been charmed by its many qualities and irritated by its few quirks. 

On the quality side - amazing design, amazing bang for the buck. Performance, acceleration - everything was pretty much as it should be. 

For the 2013 model (the first of the series) though, there were a few annoying issues. To name them - a convoluted equipment level choice (you HAD to have the captain chairs on the back if you wanted a panoramic roof), and, probably the one and only real issue - a rear suspension which was too soft for its own good (probably a straight port from the shorter wheelbase Santa Fe Sport), which was ok when driving alone with a light load, but not ok at all with a full house.

This has apparently addressed prior to the 2017 model discussed here, so if you drive a 2015 for example - this might not apply to you. If you have a 2014 though, it probably does.

The other issue was that you would probably have test driven an entry level model (same engine and suspension), but once you opted for the limited you had to chime the larger wheels (19"") in, which would make the ride even harsher (why on Earth would all brands decide that ""Luxury"" rhymes with ""larger low profile tires"" is beyond me).

Other than that, the 2013 Santa Fe was pure joy all the way.

Enter the 2017.
As mentioned - it's pretty much the same, yet not the same vehicle. So I'll just point the differences:

- It is very easy to mess up a good design, and just like Infiniti did it 10 years ago with the FX, Hyundai has been able to do the (few) subtle changes that changed the design for the worse between the 2016 and the 2017 models.

 Compared to it competition the Santa Fe is slightly narrower. In the previous versions this has been nicely compensated with a design which emphasized horizontal lines - including for the lower part of the fender and the fog lights which were horizontal. The 2017 Santa Fe Sport ALSO has horizontal fog lights, which make it look wider a wilder. Not so for the Santa Fe. The vertical fog lights (I'm quite sure someone was very proud with that choice) manage to ""close"" the horizontal line of the car's fascia and to isolate it between two vertical lines going up, making the whole vehicle look narrower and taller. 

Always wondered why the 2017 Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport don't look equally dynamic seen from the front ? Now you know.

On the back, a change as subtle as inverting the position of the backup lights (on the bottom part of the taillight on the 2017 rather than on the top part in the previous models) is enough to disrupt the lines of a behind which, already by design, is heavier, and different from the perfect behind of the Santa Fe Sport and thus very, very easy to mess up.

Last but not least - the absolutely perfect design of the 2013-2016 Santa Fe alloy wheels in Limited trim, combining elegance and dynamics to perfection, has been updated to a bland, smaller looking (if not smaller physically), average Joe alloy wheel design.

Now that we bashed the exterior, let's enter the vehicle, shall we ? 

The other reviewer's remarks about the interior's plastic put aside (I wouldn't know, have not compared with other brands), I found the 2013 dash close to perfection in design, and almost so in ergonomics. The large central volume radio button (Limited with navigation) was perfect and easy to find, and the rest was up to speed. The navigation has always been probably the most intuitive to use in the car world. 

Same for the huge, easy to find fan control button. The only real faux pas were the stupid Plus / Minus temperature control buttons, which should have always been rotary buttons (like on my 2010 Sonata, which - behold - had rotary temp control buttons but a linear Fan control button. Eeeeh... they'll get it right for my retirement year...)

In 2017, the Fan controls are the same or almost (good and bad), the radio is a banal two small rotary buttons setup (bad). The navigation and the head unit have more possibilities, but somehow the navigation screen doesn't look as clean, there is no way to switch between connected phone units while driving, little things like that.

The front seats are just as beautiful as the previous ones (very, very comfortable for whoever likes german like seats, or ""made of soft wood"", as the French call them). The seat's ventilation is genius. Beautiful thing.

Finally, memory seats. The easy entry/exit feature I'll discuss later.

Now, let's drive.

Did you put something in the cubby below the radio and then park the car? Good luck getting it out if it's a bulky item because the shifter will be in the way.  Do you plan to sit in the front passenger seat occasionally when you're not driving? The seat adjustment controls are nothing like the driver seat, and as a matter of fact, you'll sit a few inches lower on the passenger side.  Ever drop something between the driver seat and the center console? You'll never get it out without going in from the back seat underneath the seat because it's so narrow you can't even fit your fingertips in between there. Good luck vacuuming the carpet in these spaces because there are plenty of narrow spaces where things can fall but no ability to vacuum.

An 85 year old man had his second accident of the day by pulling across out multilane divided highway at just the wrong time. We hit him at something less than the 60 mph limit and both my wife and I walked away from out totaled Santa Fe. The airbags worked so well that I didn't even have bruise marks from my glasses. The only downside is that Hyundai, and everybody else, I suppose, puts the horn button on top of the steering wheel airbag. I wonder how many other people suffer my injury: my hand-on-the-horn got blown back into my chest. It took almost two months for the pain to fully subside, and another month for my hand to regain most of its strength.

Tow rating was important to me. If you buy the PIO (port installed option) trailer hitch package, the Santa Fe Limited (and SE) have a 5000 lb tow rating. According to the owner's manual, even with an aftermarket hitch it is only rated for 2000 lbs. After the accident, even though the force of our connected travel trailer impact bent the ""stinger"" 90 degrees into the bumper, but the Hyundai hitch structure seemed undamaged. The impact was so severe that even the trailer was totaled.

After the accident we had time to reflect on a replacement car. We felt so well protected by the car and had enjoyed all the features of the Ultimate package that we got the identical car in the 2016. Right away, both of us independently thought the 2016 was substantially quieter; I think they've added insulation and maybe fine tuned the suspension. 

I've seen a lot of negative comment about the third row seating. With the SE bench seat it might be a problem, but with the Limited's captains chairs it isn't much of a deal to get into the third row. Just for grins, my wife and I let our daughter and her 6' 5"" husband drive and we rode in the third row for a six hour day trip. Grandsons in the middle. We're both 70 y/o and it was perfectly comfortable. Having the panoramic sun roof almost reach the third row makes it much nicer.

My biggest complaint is that Hyundai hasn't incorporated Apple's Carplay into the display system. The existing nav system is nice, but not as good as Google Maps or Apple Maps, plus I have to pay an annual $50 fee to Sirius just to get traffic information incorporated into the nav system. Carplay was supposed to begin showing up in another Hyundai model in 2015 so I figured the 2016 would definitely have it: Wrong! The BlueLink ""turn by turn guidance"", which is $100/ year is not compatible with the navigation system.

My original review follows. 

In this review I want to focus just on the one big problem I have with my 2016 Hyundai Limited Ultimate SUV which I wish I had known about before making the purchase.  In general I agree with other reviewers that this is a good vehicle overall and a good value. It does  most things you'd expect from a modern SUV quite well. However buyers should be aware that you cannot  sit  in the vehicle and listen to the very excellent sound system in this vehicle without the engine running! If you do you will get a loud beep sound every two minutes or so along with a warning that you are discharging the battery.  This beep tone is just as loud as the music so you cannot ignore it.  So You cannot enjoy your music in this vehicle in ACC mode knowing you will be hearing this annoying beep every two minutes or so.  The dealer has  advised me that this is so you don't discharge the battery which of course is important. However why couldn't they have designed this car so that something like just listening to the radio could be done without having to run the engine?   On the side of Hyundai, if the battery does go dead there is a Lengthy restart process to get all of the technology reset back to where it was before the battery died.  I could see where this could potentially generate additional service calls, but for someone like me ( and plenty of  other folks I am sure ) who just likes to sit in their vehicle and listen to  their music on that excellent sound system this is a huge issue and unacceptable.  There are plenty of  vehicles out there with equal or more technology than this one  which do not have this problem. This is a design error on the part of Hyundai.  If  I had known this in advance I would NEVER have purchased this vehicle.   I am  NOT looking forward to the next five years of this!    Hyundai is fully aware of this issue and if it  gets enough attention  I am hoping they might take some kind of corrective action  in future models.  I am still holding out hope there may be some future firmware update from Hyundai which may resolve this issue or at least diminish it somewhat on their current offerings.  If not being able to use the radio and other accessories in this vehicle without the engine running is not an issue for you then I think you will be quite happy with this vehicle.","{'thumbsDown': 16, 'thumbsUp': 23}",Good overall but ONE MAJOR ANNOYING ISSUE for me,1489422660879.0,3.0,"{'valueRating': 4.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2016.0,,

The 3rd seat is really for the grand kids.  The V-6  has plenty of power for expressway entry and for passing. I have heated seats and wanted air cooled seats, but Hyundai has them with an additional package including a Panoramic Roof which I didn't want or need. I wish they bundle the heated/ cooled together.  I took a road trip and put on 5,000 miles (averaging 26mph could be better) with no problem.  During the trip stopped in El Paso Texas for an oil change. The dealer treated me very well like I was a local resident. They knew I was from another state, but that didn't matter.

It is smooth, quiet, has a nice V6 engine, the interior ergonomics are well thought out, and it is pretty solid to drive.  The cargo space is extremely usable.  I have owned Honda's, Acura's, and Volvo's.  This is by far my favorite car I have ever owned.  There are really only a few things that I do not love about the car.  The headlights are not very good, even with the HID's from the factory.  I upgraded to a better bulb which helped but sideward visibility could be better.  I think they may have fixed this for 2017.  I wish the transmission shifted a little quicker and crisper.  It's a little to laxed for my taste but it's not so frustrating that I hate the car.  I wish the engine was tuned for a little more low end torque rather than high end horsepower.  This would help with everyday fuel economy which is about average.  Lastly I think visibility around the side mirrors and A pillars is sub par.  Having driven Acura's and Honda's forever they really have that down.  Otherwise the car is an exceptional value for the money and the recent 2017 refresh makes it even stronger.  This car will be overlooked by many because it's a Hyundai.  I took a lot of grief from people for going from an Acura to a Hyundai.  Then they ride in it and are blown away.  It is truly 95% of the car for about 75% of the cost if you shop around.   It really has changed my whole impression of Hyundai.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 8}",The Most Underrated Crossover in the Segment,1467049291590.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 5.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'EXCELLENT', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'EXCELLENT'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2015.0,,

We both really enjoy driving the vehicle as it is fun and comfortable, but riding in the passenger seat gets uncomfortable pretty shortly. I have noticed several others here on this site have complained about the passenger front seat. Some of which have helped the discomfort of it by placing a cushion on the seat, my wife also sits on a cushion while riding in that seat while I am driving.  I have tried using the same cushion while riding in that seat but find it to be very annoying and do not find it to work very well for me. 

Our big issue is that when you spend the kind of money required to purchase this type of vehicle you should not have to purchase a seat cushion, or be uncomfortable while riding on the passenger seat, and/or expect  your spouse or other passenger to ride uncomfortably. 

This is not our first Santa Fe, in fact this is the 5th Santa Fe we have owned and none of the others have had this problem with the front passenger seat. Hyundai should realize this is an issue and resolve it, please! I don't know exactly what the answer would be to fix the problem, maybe they could attach another base etc. to the seat that is already in the vehicles to give them more height, I don't know for sure but I am sure that Hyundai has some engineers that could find a fix for the problem. I sure hope they have made changes to the passenger seat for the 2016 models.","{'thumbsDown': 3, 'thumbsUp': 7}",Passenger front seat.,1452538533084.0,4.0,"{'valueRating': 4.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2015.0,,

I remedied this by installing a front seat cushion (made for automobiles) for my wife. There are plenty of interior storage places.

The ride is very comfortable. The engine is quiet, very powerful and works well with the transmission. The middle row and rear seats are easy to lower and the floor is virtually flat. It's a vast improvement over earlier models where I had to remove the 2nd row head rests to lower the seats.

Update:  As of August 2016, I surprisingly still own this vehicle.  Other than the item noted above, there has been only one additional issue.   The molding above the rear passenger window has developed an annoying leak.  Although water does not enter the vehicle, the leak seems to contain some oily or sticky liquid which leaves the window and the door marked and which requires constant cleaning.

Update as of Feb. 2017. - After a little more than 2 years, things have settled down a bit.  The rattle mentioned previously is less noticeable and the window area leak is also not as prevalent.  All in all, I like the car.  I especially like the way it handles (steering) and the pick up it has.

Not a big deal, but a year later the replacement also developed, what I can only assume to be, a stress crack as well and needs to be replaced.  Next, the hood had to be repainted due to multiple rust spots forming on the corners.  After that, the blind spot detection system failed and required the passenger side mirror to be replaced.  Now, during the last snow storm we noticed that the car is leaking anti-freeze and from time to time the navigation will go blank and require the car to be turned off and back on again to resolve it.  For the most part the warranty has covered the issues and out of pocket cost will be the anti-freeze leak and new windshield but these are too many issues too fast.

I traded in my 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport today.  I was the first and only owner, I purchased it in June 2013.  I had the tech package, panoramic sunroof, no turbo.  The engine on this vehicle went bad in November 2016 and Hyundai put a new engine in the car.  Around mid June 2016 the vehicle started running out of oil constantly.  There was not a leak but Hyundai could not find a problem.  I NEVER MISSED A MAINTENANCE and took care of this vehicle. Then one day, black smoke came out of the tail pipe and I left the engine intersection in a black smoke cloud.  I was SO embarrased.  I took the car to Hyundai and they said the engine was bad.  The car is 3 years old.  Shake my head! Hyundai keep the car for ONE MONTH and replaced it.  In less than two week of getting it back, it ran low on oil again.   I immediately decided to get rid of this car before it caught on fire or the new engine went bad.  I read many stories online of complaints about the Sante Fe during the month I didn't have the vehicle so I was concerned the new engine may not fix the problem.  BTW, the hyundai service department guy let me know the new engine cost them $12,000.  I guess they aren't concerned about how much buying a $28,000 lemon has cost me.  I traded in the cross over for a 2017 Honda CRV and I am so happy to have that Hyundai off my hands.   Everything was covered by warranty but Hyundai can't fix the vehicle but it's unsafe.  I feared something really bad would happen and I wouldn't even have anything to trade and still have purchase a new vehicle.  I will never consider Hyundai and their warranty is pretty much useless.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 2}",WORSE CAR PURCHASE IN MY LIFE,1484668639698.0,1.0,"{'valueRating': 1.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2013.0,,

This is the best purchase we ever made in the ""family"" SUV lineups. Being the ""first to own"" a model can be a risky endeavor, but we fell in love with the ride, features and convenience and we made the right choice. Now with 50,000 miles, we've put no money into our Santa Fe Limited other than routine maintenance. An early problem with the A/C was quickly taken care of under warranty. We've driven this baby on many 1,000 mile trips with comfort that exceeds anything we've previously owned. Great highway mileage (we average 26mpg), pickup, handling and convenience. My biggest complaint is the style of the door cup holders, if that tells you anything! We specifically bought the Limited, which gives you the flexibility of having the panoramic sunroof AND roof rails... And chose the reclining/bucket-seated second row (captain;s chairs). To date we've never needed to use the roof rack, because the cargo capacity has met our needs for everything we've thrown at it. We regularly transport two band members, 2 Large PA Speakers, Pole Bag, Rack Case, Looper, Pedal board, Gig bag and 3 guitar cases with room to spare. With the guitars and one band member in another rig we can also add a Marshal Stack. The split bucket in the second row gives us great flexibility for 2x4s and long cargo needs. I especially appreciate not having my SUV in the shop all the time, which was not my experience with the other SUVs we've owned. Can't recommend this SUV enough to an active, expanding family.

It drives and handles extremely well...when it lets you.  We all make hundreds of minor steering adjustments every few minutes to correct for lane drift, bumps in the road, wind, etc.  Occasionally, at speeds above 35mph, this car decides it wants to lock the steering wheel straight.  Not so much that you can't turn it, but it takes extra effort.  It gets exhausting over the course of a long trip...and is an obvious safety concern.  The navigation system is not easily updated and it is expensive to do so.

Update July 2016.  I now believe the steering issue was related to a fading battery.  After replacing the battery two months ago, the steering issue has not returned.  This may be plausible for Hyundai's electric steering.  I'm increasing the safety rating from 3 to 4 stars.  Other safety concerns are are large front-quarter blind spots and weak headlights.  I'm increasing the overall rating from 4 to 5 stars because all the other places where I didn't give 5 stars are acceptable.","{'thumbsDown': 0, 'thumbsUp': 1}",Love to Steer,1467889398171.0,5.0,"{'valueRating': 4.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'OKAY'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2013.0,,

I bought  this Santa Fe for my wife and our two girls then 4 and 5yrs old.
First problem was  when  one of the rare seat beat  got locked up in my daughter's car seat  as she tried to unlock the seal belt so she could get out of the car while we were in the garage no matter how hard we tried we could not get it released and in fact it got more tightened across her belly to the point she started foaming. Eventually we had to do the inevitable, cut the seat belt to free our daughter. 
When we took it to the dealership ,they played it down until I told them I was not as stupid as they may think. After fixing it for us the problem persisted when I took it back they were trying to force me to believe that was how a seat belt was suppose to work. For heaven sake, I have own 12 yr old  VW and the belt worked better. As a result we had to place a scissors in the car and for 6 months my 4yr old did not want to sit in that car.
The winter was the worse periods because I had to pull on the seat belt and adjust it several times before getting it to work in the cold freezing winter.
I paid over $ 550 monthly as lease payment to endure such brutality from Hyundai.
There were so many other customer service problems with this vehicle from Hyundai  America to the local dealership including transmission breakdown that the least said the better.
I decided to add a little more  $200  to get an Acura MDX  and I feel liberated. NEVER again will I spend my hard earned dollars on a Hyundai.   
The cost savings is not worth the dangerous risk . What if we were at a shopping mall parking lot and my little darling got stuck and foamed to death as she was choking.","{'thumbsDown': 14, 'thumbsUp': 6}",beware if buying for your kids to ride in,1444399802463.0,1.0,"{'valueRating': 1.0, 'fuelEconomy': 'OKAY', 'maintenanceCost': 'OKAY', 'purchaseCost': 'OKAY', 'resaleValue': 'OKAY', 'warranty': 'TERRIBLE'}",0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2013.0,,

There were some issues early on, one of which was taken care of by the dealer.  My Santa Fe had the ""sqeaking in the dashboard"" issue which apparently a lot of other owners shared.  It was a piece of insulation left out of the production process.  The dealer initially balked at acknowledging the issue but eventually fixed it after having to completely remove the dashboard.  The ride is adequate but tire and road noise is above average for a vehicle in this class.  The 2013 Santa Fe's also have an issue with ""wandering"".  At highway speeds the car will not hold it's lane and requires constant steering corrections which is very tiring on long trips.  In the forums I read where later model years also experience this problem.  The Infotainment System has many bright spots in comparison to other vehicles I've owned and from reviews of other vehicles.  One downside is the inability of Hyundai to update it's software relating to the ""shuffle"" option for the stereo and the salesperson stating the system would play a DVD movie through the touchscreen - which it will not.

Apparently it's common for Hyundai leases to include a $400.00 Disposition Fee which is charged to you upon returning the vehicle at the end of the lease.  Granted, this fee is listed on the lease agreement but neither the sales person nor the lease manager pointed it out to me when reviewing the document.  Frankly, I wasn't expecting this additional cost as none of my prior leases ever included such a charge.  I've leased from Lexus, Lincoln, Nissan, Infiniti and Ford and have NEVER been charged a disposition fee upon return of the vehicle - even if not leasing another vehicle of the same type which is the only way Hyundai will waive the fee. I would never lease another vehicle from Hyundai as long as a Disposition fee is charged and would highly suggest anyone considering a Hyundai lease to carefully review their lease documents.","{'thumbsDown': 1, 'thumbsUp': 4}",LEASING A HYUNDAI?

The 12 speaker surround sound is concert hall quality. The 2.0 Turbo is a stout little workhorse that has plenty of zip. there's nothing i don't like about my new Santa Fe. 

Edit to add, 3 years later, still an amazing vehicle given the silly low price. Runs like a dream, very low upkeep cost, and has a lot of life left on it. Hyundia continues to crush their competition. I see more and more vehicles that seem to have outright copied the Hyundai design. Too bad they charge way more for their vehicle's than Hyundai does. 
Edit to add: 3/12 years in, she still runs like a champ. Still riding on the OEM tires and nothing other than oil changes and standard maintenance stuff has been needed. We continue to love this car. The features, the ride, the power, and oh yeah, the stereo, all add up to make this a best buy on the market today IMO. We'll keep this for at least 2 more years, and maybe more. I'm waiting on the next generation to arrive. If I like it, I'm buying one.

I highly recommend the Santa Fe Sport with the 2.0 turbo engine, would I buy it again, without a doubt I would.

HOWEVER, I have had the car not even 2 weeks and cannot get used to the 4 cylinder, which I'm assuming is the reason the car has NO pick up.
It takes too long to get going every time I have to accelerate and this makes me dread every single traffic light/stop sign.
Maybe it is because I am coming from the 6 cyl. tuscon, but it just doesnt seem like enough power for an suv.
I dont remember my test drive being like this so I'm tempted to go drive another one at the dealership andsee if it's a problem with my car. Anyone else have this?","{'thumbsDown': 4, 'thumbsUp': 5}",No pick up,0.0,3.75,,0.0,hyundai,santa-fe,2013.0,,

your estimated range (how far you can travel until you need more gas), and a bar composed of little ""bricks"" that shows you how much gas you have left.
The bricks disappear as your gas tank empties.

Either that or it is actually estimating the distance until the fuel light comes on, which I think is around 14 or 14.5 gallons (3-3.4 gallons remaining).
I'm not sure which is true.

2. If I drive exclusively on the highway I can get my average mpg rating up to 31 mpg or so, according to the digital dash display. Using simple math that means the range indicator should compute a range of about 540 miles on a 17.4 gallon tank. And yet the range indicator still counts down from ~330 miles or so.","So obviously I'm not actually averaging 31 mpg at all, and something isn't working properly.

3. After filling up the first time along the highway this past weekend, my first fuel gauge ""brick"" disappeared after 78 miles. The second one disappeared about 11 miles later, the third about 15 miles after that. By the time a full quarter of a tank had counted down, I'd gone almost 110 miles. By the time I had one bar left on the gas gauge, I'd gone about 350 miles.


On the next tank the first brick disappeared 60 miles after fill up, the second one 15 miles after that, the third about 15 miles after that. On that leg, one quarter tank had yielded about 90 miles. Same driving conditions.

Steering has 3 setting, but all constantly/quickly drift from its steering path forcing you to continuously fine tune the steering, that is tiring on long trips.

Hyundai fessed up to their ""so called"" over estimation and do provide a lifetime gas reimbursement.

like Hondas.

I'm averaging 25 mpg under average driving conditions at 75 mph, which is a pretty average highway speed in Texas.

I laid off the gas on declines and I managed to get it all the way up to 28-29 mpg.
That went back down in a hurry once I started driving normally, though.

Handling is OK, but there is more than comfortable body sway on corners.  Winter driving is OK, but if you're in heavy snow areas, winter tires are highly recommended.

Adjustments for things like auto door locks are non existent and the appointments, such as switches and controls and second rate  -- at best.

Quite honestly, if Toyota's Rav-4 did not have the goofy side-opening rear door (which they have since done away with) I would have gone with that car, or maybe the Chevy Equinox.
